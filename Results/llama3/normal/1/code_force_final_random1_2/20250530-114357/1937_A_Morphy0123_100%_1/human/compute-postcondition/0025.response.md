Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer read from the input, which is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The number of lines in stdin has decreased by 1, as one line has been read. The other variables, `n_cases` and `i`, remain unchanged. The conditions for printing the number 1 or the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` still apply, depending on the value of `n`.
