Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1`, `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decreased by 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9), and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed**
