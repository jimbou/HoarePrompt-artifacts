Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `power`, `power` is `n`, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `n_cases` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `power`, `power` is equal to `n`, and the contents of `stdin` remain the same.
