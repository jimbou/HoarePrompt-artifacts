To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `power < n`. Given the initial states:

- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an integer between 0 and 30 (inclusive)
- `power` is 1
- `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9)

The loop head involves `power` and `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `power < n` must be true. Given that `power` is initially 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state of `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 1. The other states (`n_cases`, `i`, `power`, and `stdin`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute the first time and thus do not need adjustment.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `power` is 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9)**
