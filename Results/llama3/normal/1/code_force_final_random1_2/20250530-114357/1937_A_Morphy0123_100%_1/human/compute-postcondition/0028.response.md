Output State: **n_cases is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is the base-2 logarithm of its original value, power is 1, stdin contains n_cases - 3 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9).**

The code snippet modifies the value of `n` by taking its base-2 logarithm, and assigns the value 1 to `power`. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing `n_cases - 3` lines, each with an integer `n` between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
