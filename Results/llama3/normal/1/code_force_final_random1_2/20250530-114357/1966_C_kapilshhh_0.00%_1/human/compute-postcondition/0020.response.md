Output State: **`tc` is at least 1, `n` is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 3, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, or if the difference between the first two elements is greater than 1, or if the difference between the second and third elements is greater than 1, or if the difference between the third element and the fourth element is greater than 1, otherwise False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 3, 'Alice' is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated to consider the difference between the third element and the fourth element in the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `dp` is now True if any of the following conditions are met: the difference between the first two elements is greater than 1, the difference between the second and third elements is greater than 1, the difference between the third and fourth elements is greater than 1, or if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1. Otherwise, `dp` is False.
