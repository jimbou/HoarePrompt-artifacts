Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, `n` is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 2, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, otherwise False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `tc`, `n`, `arr`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The value of `dp` will be True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, otherwise it will be False. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1.
