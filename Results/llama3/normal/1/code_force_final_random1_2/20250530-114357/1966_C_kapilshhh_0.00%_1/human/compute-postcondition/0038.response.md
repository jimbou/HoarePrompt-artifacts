Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers. It then processes each test case by removing duplicates from the list, sorting the remaining integers in descending order, and appending a 0 to the end of the list. The function checks if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, and prints 'Alice' if such a pair is found, otherwise it prints 'Alice' as well. The function repeats this process for all test cases until standard input is exhausted.**
