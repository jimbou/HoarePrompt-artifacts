Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is either True or False depending on whether the difference between the third element of `arr` and the fourth element of `arr` is greater than 1 or not, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 2, 'Alice' was printed**.

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between the third element of `arr` (`arr[i]`) and the fourth element of `arr` (`arr[i + 1]`). Since `i` is 2, `arr[i]` is the third element and `arr[i + 1]` is the fourth element. The value of `dp` is now True if the difference between these two elements is greater than 1, or False otherwise. The other variables remain unchanged.
