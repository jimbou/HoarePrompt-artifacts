Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is True if the difference between the third element of `arr` and the fourth element of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was False before, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 3, 'Alice' was printed**.

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between the third element of `arr` and the fourth element of `arr`. If `i` is less than `n`, `dp` is True if the difference is greater than 1 or if `dp` was False before. Since `i` is 3, `arr[i]` is the third element of `arr` and `arr[i + 1]` is the fourth element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
