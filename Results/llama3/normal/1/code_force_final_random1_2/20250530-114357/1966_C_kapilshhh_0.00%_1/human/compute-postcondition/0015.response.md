To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 2 and `i` is within the range from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, which is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range. Also, since `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers with a 0 appended at the end, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`tc` is at least 1, `n` is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 2, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, otherwise False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, 'Alice' is being printed**
