The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `arr`. If `i` is less than `len(arr)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `arr` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `arr` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is either True or False depending on whether the difference between the third element of `arr` and the fourth element of `arr` is greater than 1 or not, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 3, 'Alice' was printed**
