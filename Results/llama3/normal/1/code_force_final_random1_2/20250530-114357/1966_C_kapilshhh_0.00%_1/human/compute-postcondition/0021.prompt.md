Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tc is at least 1, n is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, arr is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 2, dp is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, otherwise False, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n, 'Alice' is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is at least 1, `n` is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 2, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, or if the difference between the first two elements is greater than 1, otherwise False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, 'Alice' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tc` is at least 1, `n` is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 2, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, or if the difference between the first two elements is greater than 1, or if the difference between the second and third elements is greater than 1, otherwise False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, 'Alice' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tc` is at least 1, `n` is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 3, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, or if the difference between the first two elements is greater than 1, or if the difference between the second and third elements is greater than 1, or if the difference between the third element and the fourth element is greater than 1, otherwise False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 3, 'Alice' is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
