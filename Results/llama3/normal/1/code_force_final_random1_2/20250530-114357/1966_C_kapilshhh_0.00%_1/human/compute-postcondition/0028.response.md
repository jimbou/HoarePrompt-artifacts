Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is either True or False depending on whether the difference between the first two elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or not, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, 'Alice' was printed**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition that checks if the difference between the first two elements of `arr` is greater than 1. If the difference is greater than 1, `dp` becomes True; otherwise, it becomes False. The other variables remain unchanged.
