Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tc is greater than 0, n is the length of arr minus 1, arr is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is n, 'Alice' was printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is either True or False depending on whether the difference between the first two elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or not, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, 'Alice' was printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is either True or False depending on whether the difference between the third element of `arr` and the fourth element of `arr` is greater than 1 or not, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 2, 'Alice' was printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is True if the difference between the third element of `arr` and the fourth element of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was False before, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 3, 'Alice' was printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
