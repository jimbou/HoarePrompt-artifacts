Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a list of integers. The list contains positive integers.**

In this output state, `tc` is assigned the value of the first input integer from the stdin, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains one less test case, with each test case containing a list of positive integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.
