Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least `n` elements, `dp` is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements in `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was False before, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is `n`, 'Alice' was printed**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same properties as the initial state, except for the following changes:

*   The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the length of `arr` minus 1.
*   The array `arr` must have at least `n` elements.
*   The variable `dp` will be True if the difference between any two adjacent elements in `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was False before.
