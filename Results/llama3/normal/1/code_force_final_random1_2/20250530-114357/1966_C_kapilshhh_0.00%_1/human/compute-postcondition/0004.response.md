Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, `n` is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 2, `dp` is True if the difference between the current element and the next element in the list (or 0 if it's the last element) is greater than 1, otherwise False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between the current element and the next element in the sorted list `arr`. If the difference is greater than 1, `dp` becomes True; otherwise, it becomes False. The other variables remain unchanged.
