Output State: **tc is 0, n is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, arr is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 2, dp is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, otherwise False, stdin contains no test cases, i is n, and 'Alice' is printed for every test case.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the test case counter `tc` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` will hold the number of unique positive integers in the last list minus 1. The list `arr` will be a sorted list of unique positive integers from the last list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, and its length will be at least 2. The variable `dp` will be True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the last list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, otherwise False. The standard input `stdin` will contain no test cases, as all test cases would have been processed. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n`. Finally, 'Alice' will be printed for every test case.
