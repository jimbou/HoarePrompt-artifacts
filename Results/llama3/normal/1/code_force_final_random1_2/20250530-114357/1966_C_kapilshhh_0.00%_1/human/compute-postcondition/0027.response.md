To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 2, since the range starts from 1. 

State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is True, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, 'Alice' was printed**
