To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `tc` in the loop head. According to the code, the loop can execute if `tc` is greater than 0.

Right before the loop, `tc` is a positive integer, which already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `tc`.

The state of `stdin` containing multiple test cases is not relevant to the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a list of integers. The list contains positive integers.**
