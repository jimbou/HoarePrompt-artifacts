Output State: **tc is greater than 0, n is the length of arr minus 1, arr is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is n, 'Alice' was printed**

In this output state, the value of `tc` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of `arr` minus 1, which is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1. The list `arr` is updated to be a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end. The value of `dp` is set to True, indicating that there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1. The state of `stdin` is updated to contain multiple test cases minus three, as two inputs have been read. The value of `i` is updated to be equal to `n`. Finally, 'Alice' was printed before the code execution.
