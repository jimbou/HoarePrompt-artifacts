Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 2, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, otherwise False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, and 'Alice' is being printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases (`tc`) has decreased by 1. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `dp`, `stdin`, and `i`) remain unchanged, and 'Alice' is still being printed.
