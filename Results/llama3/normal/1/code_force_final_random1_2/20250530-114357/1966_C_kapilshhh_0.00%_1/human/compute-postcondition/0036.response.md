Output State: **`tc` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the input in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least `n` elements, `dp` is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements in `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was False before, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is `n`, 'Alice' was printed twice**

In this output state, the value of `tc` has been decremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 0. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `dp` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` has also been decremented by 1. The value of `i` remains the same, and 'Alice' has been printed twice.
