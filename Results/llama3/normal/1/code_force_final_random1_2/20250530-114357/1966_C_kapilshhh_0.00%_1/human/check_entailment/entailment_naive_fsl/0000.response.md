Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the line where it prints the winner. It always prints 'Alice', regardless of the value of the variable 'dp'. The correct code should print 'Alice' if 'dp' is True and 'Bob' if 'dp' is False.

Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [0]
        dp = True
        n = len(arr) - 1
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

This corrected code will correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given conditions.
