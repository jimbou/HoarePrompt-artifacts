The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is a positive integer minus 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0. Since `tc` is a positive integer minus 1, we need to adjust it to be at least 1.

State: **`tc` is at least 1, `n` is the number of unique positive integers in the list minus 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the list in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and its length is at least 2, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list (or the last element and 0) with a difference greater than 1, otherwise False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`, and 'Alice' is being printed**
