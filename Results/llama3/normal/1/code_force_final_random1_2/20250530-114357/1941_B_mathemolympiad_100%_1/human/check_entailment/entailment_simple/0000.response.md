Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself. It then iterates over the array from the first element to the third last element. For each element, it calculates the number of operations needed to make the current element zero and applies these operations to the current element and the next two elements.

If at any point the program encounters a negative number, it immediately prints "NO" and moves on to the next test case. If it finishes iterating over the array without encountering any negative numbers, it checks if the last two elements of the array are both zero. If they are, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

This solution is correct because it correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and checks all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
