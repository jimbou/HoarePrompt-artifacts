Postcondition: ***`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[1]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[1]`, `a[3]` is reduced by the original value of `a[1]` and then by the original value of `a[1]`. If `a[2]` is less than 0, then `stop` is True and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
