Output State: **numTest is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in range(0, n - 2), a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i] and then by 2 times the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] and then by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), i is n - 2, stop is False, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of numTest remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of n is updated to the integer value of the input, which must be at least 3. The list a is updated to the list of integers from the input, where a[i] is 0 for all i in range(0, n - 2), a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i] and then by 2 times the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] and then by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3). The value of i is updated to n - 2. The value of stop remains False as it is not affected by the code. Stdin is now empty as all inputs have been consumed.
