Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: numTest is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a list of integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in range(0, n - 2), a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i] and then by 2 times the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] and then by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), stop is False, _ is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains 1 input: an integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    if a[i] < 0:
        print('NO')
        stop = True
        break
    opNum = a[i]
    a[i] -= opNum
    a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
    a[i + 2] -= opNum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numTest is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in range(0, n - 2), a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i] and then by 2 times the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] and then by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), i is 0, and 'NO' is printed if a[i] is less than 0, otherwise no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: numTest is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer that must be at least 4, a is a list of integers where a[1] is reduced by its original value, a[2] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[0] and then by 2 times the original value of a[1], a[3] is reduced by the original value of a[1] and then by the original value of a[2], i is 1. If a[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and stop is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: numTest is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer that must be at least 4, a[1] is reduced by its original value, a[2] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[0] and then by 2 times the original value of a[1], a[3] is reduced by the original value of a[1] and then by the original value of a[2], i is 2, a[2] is reduced by its original value, a[3] is reduced by 2 times the original value of a[2], a[4] is reduced by the original value of a[2]. If a[2] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and stop is True. Otherwise, the program continues with no changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
