Output State: **`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `numTest` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case, but the first input (the integer t) has been consumed. The remaining inputs for each test case are still present in the stdin.
