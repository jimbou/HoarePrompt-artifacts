The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be at least 3.
State: **numTest is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in range(0, n - 2), a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i] and then by 2 times the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] and then by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), i is 1, if a[i] is less than 0, then stop is True, otherwise stop remains False, stdin contains no input.**
