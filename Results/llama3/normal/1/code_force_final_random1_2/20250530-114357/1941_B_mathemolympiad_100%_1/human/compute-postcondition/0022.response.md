Output State: **numTest is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a list of integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in range(0, n - 2), a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i] and then by 2 times the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] and then by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), stop is False if all a[i] are non-negative for all i in range(0, n - 2), otherwise stop is True and 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `numTest` remains unchanged, within the range of 1 to 10^4 (inclusive).
* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The list `a` is modified such that:
	+ All elements `a[i]` for `i` in the range 0 to `n-2` are set to 0.
	+ For each `i` in the range 0 to `n-3`, the element `a[i+1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[i]`.
	+ For each `i` in the range 0 to `n-3`, the element `a[i+2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]` and then by the original value of `a[i]`.
* The value of `stop` is set to `False` if all elements `a[i]` for `i` in the range 0 to `n-2` are non-negative. If any of these elements are negative, `stop` is set to `True` and the string 'NO' is printed.
