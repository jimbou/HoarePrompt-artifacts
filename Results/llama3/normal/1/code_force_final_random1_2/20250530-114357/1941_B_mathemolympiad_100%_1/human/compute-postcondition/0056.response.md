Output State: **`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 2), `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]` and then by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `i` is `n` - 3, and 'NO' is printed if `a[i]` is less than 0, otherwise no changes are made. The current value of `stop` is True, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of `numTest`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `stop` remain unchanged.
