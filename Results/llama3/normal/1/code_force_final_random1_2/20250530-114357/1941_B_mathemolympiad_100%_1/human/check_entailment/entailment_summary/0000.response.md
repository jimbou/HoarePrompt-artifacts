Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the described operation and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero. The program iterates through the array, applying the operation as many times as possible, and then checks if the last two elements are zero. If any element becomes negative during the process, it immediately prints 'NO' and skips to the next test case. This is a correct approach to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
