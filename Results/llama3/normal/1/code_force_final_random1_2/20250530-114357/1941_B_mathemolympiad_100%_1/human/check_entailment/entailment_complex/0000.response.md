Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer n and a list of n integers.
2. The program iterates through the list of integers, attempting to reduce each element to zero by subtracting the current element from the next two elements. This is in line with the problem description, which states that Rudolf can apply the operation any number of times.
3. The program checks if any element in the list is negative after the reduction operation. If so, it immediately prints 'NO' and skips to the next test case. This is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \* 10^5, which means that the list of integers cannot contain negative numbers.
4. After the reduction operation, the program checks if the last two elements of the list are both zero. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because the problem statement requires that all elements of the array be equal to zero using the described operations.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
