Postcondition: ***numTest is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is at least 4, a is a list of integers where a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i], i is 1. If a[i] is less than 0, then stop is True. Otherwise, stop remains False.***
