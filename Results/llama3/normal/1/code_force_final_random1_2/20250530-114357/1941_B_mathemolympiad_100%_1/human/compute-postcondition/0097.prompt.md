Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(0, numTest):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    stop = False
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
        if a[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            stop = True
            break
        opNum = a[i]
        a[i] -= opNum
        a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
        a[i + 2] -= opNum
    if stop == True:
        continue
    if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 2), `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]` and then by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3). If all `a[i]` are non-negative for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 2), then `stop` is False. Otherwise, `stop` is True, 'NO' has been printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, if the last two elements of `a` are both 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: numTest is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in range(0, n - 2), a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i] and then by 2 times the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] and then by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), i is n - 3. If stop is True, the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped. If a[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed, otherwise no changes are made. If the last two elements of the list a are not 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`numTest` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 2), `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]` and then by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `i` is `n` - 2. If the last two elements of `a` are both 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the last two elements of `a` are not both 0, 'NO' is printed. If `stop` is True, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
