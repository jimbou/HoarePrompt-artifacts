Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the elements of the array can be made zero by applying the operation to the first n-2 elements. However, it does not consider the case where the last two elements cannot be made zero.

A correct solution would need to check if the sum of the elements at each index is a multiple of 3, and if the sum of the elements at each index is non-negative. If these conditions are met, then it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.
