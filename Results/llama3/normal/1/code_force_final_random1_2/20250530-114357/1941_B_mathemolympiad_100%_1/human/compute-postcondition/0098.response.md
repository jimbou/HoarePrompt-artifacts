Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then attempts to reduce the list of integers to zeros by iteratively subtracting the current element from the next two elements. If the last two elements of the list can be reduced to zeros, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If any element in the list is negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and skips to the next test case. The function repeats this process for all test cases.**
