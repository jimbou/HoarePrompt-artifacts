To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be at least 4 to satisfy the loop condition.

The other variables, `numTest`, `stop`, and `a`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `stop` is False, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[1]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[1]`, `a[3]` is reduced by the original value of `a[1]` and then by the original value of `a[1]`.**
