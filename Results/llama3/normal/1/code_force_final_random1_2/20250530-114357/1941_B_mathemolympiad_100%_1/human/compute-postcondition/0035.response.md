To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute.

State: **`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 2), `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]` and then by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `stop` is False, `_` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, `i` is 0**
