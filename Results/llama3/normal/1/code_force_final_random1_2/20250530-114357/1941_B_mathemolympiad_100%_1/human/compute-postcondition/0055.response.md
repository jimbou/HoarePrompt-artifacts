Postcondition: **numTest is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer that must be at least 3, a is a list of integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in range(0, n - 2), a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i] and then by 2 times the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] and then by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(0, n - 3), i is n - 3, and 'NO' is printed if a[i] is less than 0, otherwise no changes are made. The current value of stop is True.**
