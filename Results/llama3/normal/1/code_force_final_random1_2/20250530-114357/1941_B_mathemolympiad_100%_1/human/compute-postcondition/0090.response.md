Postcondition: **`numTest` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 2), `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]` and then by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `i` is `n` - 2. The current value of `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or the current value of `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0. If `stop` is True, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
