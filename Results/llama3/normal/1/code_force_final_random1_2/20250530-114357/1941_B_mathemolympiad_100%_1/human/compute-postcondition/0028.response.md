Output: **`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 2), `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3), `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]` and then by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 3). If all `a[i]` are non-negative for all `i` in range(0, `n` - 2), then `stop` is False. Otherwise, `stop` is True, 'NO' has been printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. The current value of `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or the current value of `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, and 'NO' is printed**
