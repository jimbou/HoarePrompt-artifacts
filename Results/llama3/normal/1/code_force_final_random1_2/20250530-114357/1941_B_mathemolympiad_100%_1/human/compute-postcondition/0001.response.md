The only variable in the loop head is `numTest`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `numTest`. If `numTest` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, the state of `numTest` does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**
