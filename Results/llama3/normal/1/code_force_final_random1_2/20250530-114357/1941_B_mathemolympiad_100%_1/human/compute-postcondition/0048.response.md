The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`numTest` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1]` is reduced by its original value, `a[2]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[0]` and then by 2 times the original value of `a[1]`, `a[3]` is reduced by the original value of `a[1]` and then by the original value of `a[2]`, `i` is 2**
