Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, i is n-1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the nth element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the ith element being 1000 plus the sum of the first i-1 elements in x plus the ith element of x, the (i+1)th element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x, and the rest of the elements remain the same, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the ith element being 1000 plus the sum of the first i-1 elements in x plus the ith element of x, the (i+1)th element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x plus the ith element of x, and the rest of the elements remain the same, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the ith element being 1000 plus the sum of the first i-1 elements in x plus the ith element of x, the (i+1)th element being 1000 plus the sum of the first i elements in x, and the rest of the elements remain the same, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
