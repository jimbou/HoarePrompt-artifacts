Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the ith element being 1000 plus the sum of the first i-1 elements in x plus the ith element of x, the (i+1)th element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x, and the rest of the elements remain the same, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the current element `x[i - 1]`. The rest of the elements in `a` remain the same. The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, stdin, and `_` are unchanged. The list `a` is still being printed.
