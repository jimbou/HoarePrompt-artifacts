The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a`.

The list `a` is defined as a list of `n` integers, where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is 1000 plus the sum of all elements in the list `x` up to that point.

Since `x` is a list of integers, the sum of its elements will be an integer. Let's denote this sum as `sum_x`.

The elements of `a` can be described as follows:

* The first element is 1000.
* The second element is 1000 + `x[0]`.
* The third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`.
* ...
* The `n`-th element is 1000 + `sum_x`.

Since `i` is `n-1`, the last element of `a` is 1000 + `sum_x`.

The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + sum_x**
