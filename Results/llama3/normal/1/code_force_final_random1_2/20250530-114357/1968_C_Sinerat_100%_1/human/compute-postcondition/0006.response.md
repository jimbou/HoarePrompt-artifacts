To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1, it will increment by 1 at the start of each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`x`, `a`, stdin, and `_`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of `x`, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x`, and the rest being 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines, _ is 0**
