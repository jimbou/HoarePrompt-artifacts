To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is an iteration variable. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer
* `i` is `n-1`
* `x` is a list of integers
* `a` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of `x`, and so on.
* `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines
* `_` is 1
* The list `a` is being printed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop executes again. The only variable that changes is `_`, which increments by 1.

Since `_` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. The other variables in the state do not change because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of `x`, and so on, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, `_` is 2, and the list `a` is being printed**
