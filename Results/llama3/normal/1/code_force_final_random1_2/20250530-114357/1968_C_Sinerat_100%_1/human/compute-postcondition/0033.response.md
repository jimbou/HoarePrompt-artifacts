Output State: **n is an integer, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of x, i is n-1, _ is t-1, stdin contains no lines of input, and the list a is being printed, where a contains 1000 and the cumulative sum of the list x.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be an integer, `x` will be a list of integers, and `a` will be a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `x`. The variable `i` will be `n-1`, and `_` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. Additionally, stdin will contain no lines of input, and the list `a` will be being printed, containing 1000 and the cumulative sum of the list `x`.
