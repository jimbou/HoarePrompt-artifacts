Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `x`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `a` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in list `x`, starting from 1000. The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
