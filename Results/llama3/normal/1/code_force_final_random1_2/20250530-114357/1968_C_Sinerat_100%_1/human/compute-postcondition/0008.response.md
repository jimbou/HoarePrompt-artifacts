Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is n-1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the nth element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus n lines, _ is 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is now `n-1`, and the list `a` has been updated such that each element `a[i]` is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to index `i-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
