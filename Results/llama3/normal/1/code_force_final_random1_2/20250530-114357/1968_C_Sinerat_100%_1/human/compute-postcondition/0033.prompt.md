Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500). Each of the following t lines contains n-1 integers x_2, …, x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, i is n-1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the nth element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus n lines, _ is 0, and the list a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, i is n-1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the nth element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed, and the list a is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of `x`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, and the list `a` is being printed, where `a` contains 1000 and the cumulative sum of the list `x`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
