Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the ith element being 1000 plus the sum of the first i-1 elements in x plus the ith element of x, the (i+1)th element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x plus the ith element of x, and the rest of the elements remain the same, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous value of `a[i-1]` and the value of `x[i-1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still being printed.
