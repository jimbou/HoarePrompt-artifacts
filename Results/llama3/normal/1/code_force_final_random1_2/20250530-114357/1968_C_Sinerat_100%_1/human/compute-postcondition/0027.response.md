Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and the second element is 1000 + `x[0]` and the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` and the fourth element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still an integer greater than 2, `x` is still a list of integers, `a` is still a list of `n` integers but the fourth element has been updated to be the sum of the third element and `x[2]`, `i` is still 2, `_` is still 2, and stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines.
