Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000 and the second element being 1000 plus the first element of `x`, and the rest being 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` is now equal to `a[0]` (which is 1000) plus `x[0]` (the first element of `x`). The rest of the elements in `a` remain unchanged, with the first element being 1000 and the rest being 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state.
