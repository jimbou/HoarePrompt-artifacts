Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of `x`, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x`, and the rest being 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, `a[2]` is now equal to `a[1]` plus `x[1]`. The value of `a[1]` is 1000 plus the first element of `x`, so `a[2]` is now 1000 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
