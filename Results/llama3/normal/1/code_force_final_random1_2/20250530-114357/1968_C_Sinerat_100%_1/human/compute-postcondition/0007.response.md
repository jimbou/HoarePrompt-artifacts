Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of `x`, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x`, the fourth element being 1000 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x` plus the third element of `x`, and the rest being 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines, _ is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 4, `i` is still 3, and `x` is still a list of integers. The list `a` has been updated such that its fourth element is now the sum of the first three elements of `a` and the third element of `x`. The rest of the elements in `a` remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus three lines, and the value of `_` is still 0.
