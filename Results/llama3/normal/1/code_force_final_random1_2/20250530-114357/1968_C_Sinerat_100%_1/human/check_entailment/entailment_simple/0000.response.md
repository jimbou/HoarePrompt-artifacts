Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n, where x_2, x_3, ..., x_n is the given input array.

The program initializes the first element of the array a as 1000, which is a valid choice since 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, it calculates a_i as a_{i-1} + x_i. This ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} because a_i mod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_i) mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

Finally, the program prints the array a, which satisfies the given conditions.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
