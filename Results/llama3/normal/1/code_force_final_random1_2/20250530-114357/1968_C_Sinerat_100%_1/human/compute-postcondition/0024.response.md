The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer read from stdin, x is a list of integers read from stdin, a is a list of n zeros with the first element being 1000, i is n-1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer read from stdin that must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers read from stdin, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1000, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines**
