The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains an integer n and n-1 integers. It then calculates the cumulative sum of the integers for each set of n-1 integers, prepending 1000 to each set, and prints the resulting lists. The function repeats this process t times, consuming all input from stdin.
