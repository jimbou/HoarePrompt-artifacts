The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _.  If the variable _ is less than the number of lines in stdin the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus n lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable _ is 1 and stdin contains multiple lines of input minus n+1 lines.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is n-1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the nth element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus n+1 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed**
