Output State: **n is a positive integer, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000 and the rest being 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines, _ is 0**

In this output state, `n` is a positive integer because it is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which must be greater than 0 according to the precondition. `x` is a list of integers because it is assigned the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which splits the input into a list of integers. `a` is a list of `n` integers, with the first element being 1000 and the rest being 0, because it is initialized with `n` zeros and then the first element is set to 1000. Stdin contains multiple lines of input minus two lines because two lines are consumed by `int(input())` and `input().split()`. `_` remains 0 because it is not modified by the code.
