Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and the second element is 1000 + `x[0]` and the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` and the fourth element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]` and the fifth element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]` + `x[3]`, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the element at index `i - 1` in the list `x`. The value of `i` remains the same, and the values of `n`, `x`, and `_` are unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines.
