Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, this means that the second element of `a` (at index 1) has been updated to be 1000 + `x[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
