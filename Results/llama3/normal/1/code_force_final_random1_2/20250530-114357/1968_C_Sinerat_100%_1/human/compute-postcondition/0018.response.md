Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the ith element being 1000 plus the sum of the first i-1 elements in x plus the ith element of x, the (i+1)th element being 1000 plus the sum of the first i elements in x, and the rest of the elements remain the same, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which means the ith element of `a` is now 1000 plus the sum of the first i elements in `x`. The rest of the elements in `a` remain the same. The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, stdin, and _ are unchanged.
