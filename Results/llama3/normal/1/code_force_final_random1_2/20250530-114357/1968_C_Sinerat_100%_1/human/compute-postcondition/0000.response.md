The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple lines of input, so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
