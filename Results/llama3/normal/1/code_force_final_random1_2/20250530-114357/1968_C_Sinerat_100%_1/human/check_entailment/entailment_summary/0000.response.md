Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
* For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.
* It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with the first element `a_1` set to 1000, which satisfies the condition `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
* It then calculates the remaining elements `a_2, a_3, ..., a_n` using the formula `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}`, which ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
* Finally, it prints the array `a` for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, consuming all input from stdin and producing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
