The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 1000, the second element being 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element being 1000 plus the first element of x plus the second element of x, and so on, until the ith element being 1000 plus the sum of the first i-1 elements in x plus the ith element of x, the (i+1)th element being 1000 plus the sum of all elements in x plus the ith element of x, and the rest of the elements remain the same, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus 2 lines, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed**
