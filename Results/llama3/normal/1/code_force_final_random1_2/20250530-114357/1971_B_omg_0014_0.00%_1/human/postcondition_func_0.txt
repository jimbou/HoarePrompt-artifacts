This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks each string for uniqueness of characters, and prints 'YES' if all characters are unique or 'NO' if there are exactly two unique characters. If 'YES' is printed, it then prints the string in either ascending or descending order, depending on whether the original string was already sorted in ascending order. The function processes a number of strings specified by an initial integer input.
