Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires that the rearranged string r should not be equal to the original string s. However, the program does not guarantee this condition. 

When the length of the set a is greater than 2, the program prints 'YES' and then prints either the sorted string b or the reverse sorted string c. However, if the original string s is already sorted in ascending order, the program prints the reverse sorted string c, which is not necessarily different from the original string s. 

For example, if the input string is 'abcde', the program will print 'YES' and then print 'abcde' again, which is the same as the original string.

Correctness: **False**
