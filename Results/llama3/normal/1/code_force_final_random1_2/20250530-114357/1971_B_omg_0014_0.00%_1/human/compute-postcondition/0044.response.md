Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), i is n-1, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters from s, stdin is empty. If the length of a is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, b is a string consisting of the characters in s in ascending order, c is a string consisting of the characters in s in descending order. If the string s is equal to the string b, then the string c is printed. Otherwise, the string b is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the initial number of strings in the input. The variable `s` will hold the last string read from the input, and `a` will be a set of unique letters in that string. The input stream will be empty, as all strings have been read. If the last string had exactly two unique letters, the output will contain the string 'NO'. Otherwise, it will contain the string 'YES', followed by either the sorted version of the last string in ascending or descending order, depending on whether the original string was already sorted in ascending order.
