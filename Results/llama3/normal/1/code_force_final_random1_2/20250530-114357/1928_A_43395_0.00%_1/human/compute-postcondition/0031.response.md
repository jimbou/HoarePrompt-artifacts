Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 2 (1 <= t - 2 <= 10^4 - 2). Each of the following t - 2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if either `a` or `b` is equal to the negation of the difference between `a` and `b`, 'no' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**
