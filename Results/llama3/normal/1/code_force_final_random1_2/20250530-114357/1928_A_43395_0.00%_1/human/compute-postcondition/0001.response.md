The code assigns the values of `a` and `b` from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `[int(i) for i in ...]` converts them to integers. The stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin now contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 1 (0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4 - 1). Each of the following t - 1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 1 (0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4 - 1). Each of the following t - 1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
