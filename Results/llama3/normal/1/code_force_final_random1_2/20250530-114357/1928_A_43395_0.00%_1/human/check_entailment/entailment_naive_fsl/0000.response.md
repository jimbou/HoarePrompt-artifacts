Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, when the input is 2 2, the program prints 'yes', but according to the problem description, the correct output should be 'no'. This is because the 2x2 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and from these, only the 1x4 rectangle can be formed, which is considered the same as the original 2x2 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly check if the two resulting rectangles can be used to form a different rectangle. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is not sufficient to determine if a different rectangle can be formed. A correct solution would need to check if the greatest common divisor of a and b is greater than 1, and if so, print 'yes', otherwise print 'no'.
