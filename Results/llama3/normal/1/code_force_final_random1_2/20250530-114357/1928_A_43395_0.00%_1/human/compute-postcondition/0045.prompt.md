Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
        print('no')
    elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 1 (0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4 - 1). Each of the following t - 1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is odd, then if `a` equals `b` or `a` equals `-b`, 'no' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 2 (1 <= t - 2 <= 10^4 - 2). Each of the following t - 2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if either `a` or `b` is equal to the negation of the difference between `a` and `b`, 'no' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 2 (1 <= t - 2 <= 10^4 - 2). Each of the following t - 2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if either `a` equals `-b` or `b` equals `-a`, 'no' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
