This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers a and b. It then iterates through each test case, checking the parity of a and b, and prints 'yes' if both are even or their difference is odd, and 'no' if either a equals -b or b equals -a, or if the difference between a and b is even. The function effectively determines whether the sum of a and b is even or odd for each test case and prints the corresponding result.
