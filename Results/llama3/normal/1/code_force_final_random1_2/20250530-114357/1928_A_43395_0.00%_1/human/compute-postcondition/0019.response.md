The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 1 (0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4 - 1). Each of the following t - 1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). For the loop to execute again i is increased by 1 so i is 1 and for the loop to execute again the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 1 (1 <= t - 1 <= 10^4 - 1). Each of the following t - 1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**
