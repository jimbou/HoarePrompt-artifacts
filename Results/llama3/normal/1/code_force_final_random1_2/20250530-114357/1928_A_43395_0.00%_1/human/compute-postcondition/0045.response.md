Output State: **`i` is `t`, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer 0 (0 <= 0 <= 10^4). Each of the following 0 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if either `a` equals `-b` or `b` equals `-a`, 'no' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all `t` iterations, and the loop variable `i` has reached its final value of `t`. The input state remains unchanged, with `a` and `b` still being integers within the specified range, and the standard input containing multiple lines of input. However, since the loop has finished executing, there are no more lines of input to process, and the first line of input now contains a single integer 0. The conditions for printing 'yes' or 'no' remain the same as in the previous output states.
