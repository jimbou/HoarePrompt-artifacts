Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 1 (0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4 - 1). Each of the following t - 1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is odd, then if `a` equals `b` or `a` equals `-b`, 'no' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'no' is printed.**
