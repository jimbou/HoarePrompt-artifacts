Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 1 (0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4 - 1). Each of the following t - 1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). Either `a` or `b` (or both) is odd. The current value of `a` and `b` is such that either `a` is equal to `b` or `a` is equal to `-b`***
