Reasoning:

The given program is trying to solve the problem by checking the parity of the sides of the rectangle and the difference between them. However, the conditions used in the program are not entirely correct.

The first condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` checks if both sides are even, and if so, prints 'yes'. This is correct because if both sides are even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then form a new rectangle with a different size.

The second condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. This condition is trying to check if the difference between the sides is equal to the negative of one of the sides, but the syntax is incorrect. Even if the syntax was correct, this condition would not be sufficient to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle.

The third condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` checks if the difference between the sides is odd, and if so, prints 'yes'. This is correct because if the difference is odd, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then form a new rectangle with a different size.

The fourth condition `else: print('no')` is incorrect. This condition assumes that if none of the above conditions are met, Bob cannot form a new rectangle. However, this is not true. For example, if the sides are 3 and 2, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then form a new rectangle with a different size.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
