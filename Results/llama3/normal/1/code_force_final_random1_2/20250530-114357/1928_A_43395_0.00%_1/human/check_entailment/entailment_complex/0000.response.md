Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles as he wishes.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It first checks if both `a` and `b` are even, in which case it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two equal rectangles. If not, it checks if either `a` equals `-b` or `b` equals `-a`, in which case it prints 'no' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two different rectangles. Finally, it checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, in which case it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two different rectangles.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct result for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
