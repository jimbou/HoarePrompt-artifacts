Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t - 2 (1 <= t - 2 <= 10^4 - 2). Each of the following t - 2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two integers read from the first line of the input, which contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The value of `i` remains unchanged, still equal to 1. The stdin now contains multiple lines of input, with the first line containing a single integer t - 2 (1 <= t - 2 <= 10^4 - 2), and each of the following t - 2 lines containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
