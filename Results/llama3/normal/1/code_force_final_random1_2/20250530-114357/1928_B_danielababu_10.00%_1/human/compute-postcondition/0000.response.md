Output State: **arr is a list of non-zero integers, ans is an empty list, tem is 1**

The code initializes two new variables, `ans` and `tem`, without modifying the existing variable `arr`. The variable `ans` is assigned an empty list, and the variable `tem` is assigned the value 1. The state of `arr` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code.
