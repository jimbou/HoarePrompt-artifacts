The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If arr has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, arr is a list of non-zero integers, ans is an empty list, tem is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `arr` is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 1 element and i is now len(arr) - 1.
State: **`arr` is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is len(arr) - 1**
