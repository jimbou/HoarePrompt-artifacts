The code multiplies the value of `tem` by the last element of `arr` and assigns the result back to `tem`. Then, it appends the new value of `tem` to the list `ans`.

Output State: **arr is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, tem is the product of the last element of arr and 1, i is len(arr) - 1**
