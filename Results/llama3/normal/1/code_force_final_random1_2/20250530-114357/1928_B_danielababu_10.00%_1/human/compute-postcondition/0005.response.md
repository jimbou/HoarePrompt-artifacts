To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `len(arr) - 1` down to `-1` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`.

Currently, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, which means the loop has already iterated over the last element of `arr` (at index `len(arr) - 1`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(arr) - 3`.

The other variables in the loop head are `arr`, but its state doesn't need to be adjusted because the loop only depends on the index `i`.

The other variables `ans`, `tem` are not in the loop head, so their states don't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and the product of the second last element of `arr` and the last element of `arr`, `tem` is the product of the second last element of `arr` and the last element of `arr`, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`**
