Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not solve the problem described. The problem asks to find the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array a that can be obtained after adding some permutation to the array a. However, the provided program does not implement any logic to solve this problem. It only contains some generic functions for reading input and sorting arrays, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem.

A correct solution to the problem would involve sorting the array and then iterating over the sorted array to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. The provided program does not implement this logic, therefore it is incorrect.
