Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation to the array. The program uses a combination of functions to read input, process the data, and calculate the maximum frequency of elements.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases using function `func_1()`. Then, for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()` and the array elements using `func_3()`. It calculates the maximum element in the array `m` and creates a new array `new` by subtracting each element from `m` and adding 1. The new array is then sorted.

The program then creates a set `ans` to store unique elements from the sorted array `new` that are within the range of 1 to `n`. Finally, it prints the length of the set `ans`, which represents the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation.

Based on the execution summaries of the functions, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, `func_4()`, `func_5()`, `func_6()`, `func_7()`, `func_8()`, and `func_9()` are used to read input, process data, and calculate the maximum frequency of elements. The program correctly uses these functions to solve the problem.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
