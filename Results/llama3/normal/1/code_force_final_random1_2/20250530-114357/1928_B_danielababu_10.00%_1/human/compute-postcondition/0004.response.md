Output State: **arr is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the product of the second last element of arr and the last element of arr, tem is the product of the second last element of arr and the last element of arr, i is len(arr) - 2**

The code multiplies the current value of `tem` by the element at index `i` in `arr` and assigns the result back to `tem`. Since `tem` was initially the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, this operation effectively calculates the product of the second last element of `arr` and the last element of `arr`. This new value of `tem` is then appended to the list `ans`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
