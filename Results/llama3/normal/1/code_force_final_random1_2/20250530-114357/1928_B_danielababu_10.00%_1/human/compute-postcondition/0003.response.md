To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects in it accordingly.

The loop head is: `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`

The objects in the loop head are `i`, `arr`, and the range object created by `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, which means the loop has already processed the last element of `arr`.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(arr) - 2`.

The state of `arr` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `ans` and `tem` is not relevant to the loop head, so they are not adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`arr` is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `tem` is the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 2**
