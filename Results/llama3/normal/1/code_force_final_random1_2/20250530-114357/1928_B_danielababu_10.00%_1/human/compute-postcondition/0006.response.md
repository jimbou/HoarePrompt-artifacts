Output State: **arr is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, the product of the second last element of arr and the last element of arr, and the product of the second last element of arr, the last element of arr, and the element at index i, tem is the product of the second last element of arr, the last element of arr, and the element at index i, i is len(arr) - 3**

In this output state, the value of `tem` has been updated by multiplying it with the element at index `i` in the list `arr`. This updated value of `tem` has also been appended to the list `ans`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `len(arr) - 3`. The list `arr` and its elements remain unchanged.
