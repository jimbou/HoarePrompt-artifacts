Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains four lines of input. It processes each test case by calculating the differences between consecutive elements in two lists, computing the ratios of these differences, and then using these ratios to estimate the value of a function at a given point. The function prints the estimated values for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and does not return any value.**
