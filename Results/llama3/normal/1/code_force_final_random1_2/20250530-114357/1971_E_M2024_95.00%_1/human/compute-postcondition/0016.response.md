Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing five integers 0, b[1]-b[0], b[2]-b[1], b[3]-b[2], and b[4]-b[3], `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated by appending the difference between the fourth and third elements of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
