Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing four elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], and ad[3] / bd[3], `i` is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated to include the ratio of the differences between the third and fourth elements of `a` and `b`, in addition to the previous ratios. The other variables remain unchanged.
