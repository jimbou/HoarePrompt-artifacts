Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing 2 integers: 0 and `a[1] - a[0]`, `bd` is a list containing 1 integer: 0, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `ql` is an integer equal to its original value minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`, `stdin` contains `t-q-2` test cases, and `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.**

In this output state, the list `ad` has been updated to include the difference between the first two elements of list `a`, which is `a[1] - a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
