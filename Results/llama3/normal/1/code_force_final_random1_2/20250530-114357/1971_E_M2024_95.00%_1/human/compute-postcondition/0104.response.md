Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is 0, ql is an integer, l is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases, and s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is reset to 0. The value of `ql` is updated to an integer input from `stdin`, and `s` is updated to the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
