The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of list `b`. If `i` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `b` has at least 3 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least 4 integers.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing four integers 0, b[1]-b[0], b[2]-b[1], and b[3]-b[2], `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 3**
