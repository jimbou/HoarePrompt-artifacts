To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `b` is a list of at least 4 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The length of `b` must still be at least 4, so no change is needed for `b`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 3 integers: 0, the difference between the second and first elements of `b`, and the difference between the third and second elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is 3, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `ql` is an integer equal to its original value minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`, `stdin` contains `t-q-2` test cases, and `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.**
