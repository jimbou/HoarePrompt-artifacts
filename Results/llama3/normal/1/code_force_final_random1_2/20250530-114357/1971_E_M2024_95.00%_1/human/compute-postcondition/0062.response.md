Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing 2 integers: 0 and the difference between the second and first elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `v` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is `q`, and nothing is being printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `i`, `stdin`, and `l` remain unchanged. The list `ad` now contains two elements: the initial value 0 and the difference between the second and first elements of `a`. The list `a` still contains `n+1` integers with at least 2 elements.
