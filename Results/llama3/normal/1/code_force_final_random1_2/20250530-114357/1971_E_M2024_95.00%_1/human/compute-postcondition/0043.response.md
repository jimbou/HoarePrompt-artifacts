Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s-1], m is 0, s is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, l is 1. If a[s] is equal to ql, then the value of b[s] has been printed and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
