Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is n, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s-1], m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s-1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer, stdin contains t-2 test cases, l is 0. If a[s] equals ql, then the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the integer value of m is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s-1] minus a[s-1], m is equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, l is 1, and the integer value of m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program either skips to the next iteration of the loop if the value at index `s` in list `a` is equal to `ql`, or it continues executing the next lines of code if the value at index `s` in list `a` is not equal to `ql`, maintaining the original values of all variables and lists, and the sorted order of list `a`. If the value at index `s` in list `a` is not equal to `ql`, then `ql` is decremented by the value at index `s-1` in list `a`, `m` is incremented by the value at index `s-1` in list `b`, and `m` is further incremented by the product of `bd[s]`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad[s]`, and the integer value of `m` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
