Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing three elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], and ad[2] / bd[2], `i` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
