To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `l` and `q`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `l` is less than `q`. At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 1 and `q` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `l` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `n+1` integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing `n+1` integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `m` is `m` plus `b[s - 1]` plus `bd[s]` times `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql` minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, and the value of `m` which is `m` plus `b[s - 1]` plus `bd[s]` times `ql` divided by `ad[s]` is being printed**
