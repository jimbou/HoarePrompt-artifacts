Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing a single element 0, `i` is n, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `_` is still 0, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `i` retain their original values. A new variable `v` is introduced, which is a list containing a single element 0. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
