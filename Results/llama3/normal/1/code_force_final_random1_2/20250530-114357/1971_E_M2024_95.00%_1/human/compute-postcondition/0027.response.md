Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is n, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The value of `t` remains greater than 0, the value of `_` remains 0, the values of `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged, the lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` remain unchanged, the list `v` now contains `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, and the value of `i` is now `n`. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
