Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q, where k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. The second line contains k integers a_i, where 1 <= a_i <= n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1 and a_k = n. The third line contains k integers b_i, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d, where 0 <= d <= n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, stdin contains t test cases, l is q, and nothing is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s - 1], l is q, stdin contains t-q test cases, and s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql, and nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: m is the sum of its original value, b[s - 1], and the product of bd[s], ql, and the division of ql by ad[s], i is 1, ql is the integer value from stdin minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, a, b, bd, ad, and l are unchanged, the integer value of m is not printed, q is 0, stdin contains t-q-2 test cases, and nothing is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
