Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 3 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing three integers 0, b[1]-b[0], and b[2]-b[1], `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated to include the difference between the second and third elements of `b`, in addition to the existing difference between the first and second elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
