To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `b`. Since `b` is a list of at least 3 integers, the length of `b` is at least 3.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The length of `b` is still at least 3, so the loop can execute again.

The other variables in the state are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 3 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 2 integers: 0 and the difference between the second and first elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is 2, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `ql` is an integer equal to its original value minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`, `stdin` contains `t-q-2` test cases, and `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.**
