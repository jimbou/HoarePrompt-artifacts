To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, the length of `a` is at least 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `a` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing 2 integers: 0 and `a[1] - a[0]`, `bd` is a list containing 1 integer: 0, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is 2, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `ql` is an integer equal to its original value minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`, `stdin` contains `t-q-2` test cases, and `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.**
