Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `n+1` integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing `n+1` integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is 0, and nothing is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql, ql is ql - a[s - 1], l is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and this is printed: the integer value of m, which is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is m plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], ql is ql minus a[s - 1], l is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql, and the value of m which is m plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s - 1], l is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, and s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql, and the integer value of m is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
