Postcondition: ***m is 0, i is 1, ql is the integer value from stdin, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, a, b, bd, ad, and l are unchanged, the integer value of m is not printed, q is greater than 1, stdin contains no input. If a[s] equals ql, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
