The only variables in the loop head are variables `i`, `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `a` has at least 2 elements. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing a single element 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
