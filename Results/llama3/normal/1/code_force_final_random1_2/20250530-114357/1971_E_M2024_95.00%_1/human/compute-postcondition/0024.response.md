To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `a` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing three elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], and ad[2] / bd[2], `i` is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
