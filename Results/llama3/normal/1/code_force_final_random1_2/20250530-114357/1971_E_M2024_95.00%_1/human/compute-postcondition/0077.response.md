The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, i is n. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `n+1` integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing `n+1` integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing 1 element: 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is 0, and nothing is being printed.**
