Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing 3 integers: 0, the difference between the second and first elements of `a`, and the difference between the third and second elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `v` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is `q`, and nothing is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `ad` has been updated to include the difference between the third and second elements of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
