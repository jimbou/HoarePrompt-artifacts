Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `n+1` integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing `n+1` integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing 3 elements: 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, and `ad[2] / bd[2]`, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `l` is 0, and nothing is being printed.**

The value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
