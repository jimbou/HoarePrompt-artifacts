t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that k <= n <= 10^9, q is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of k distinct integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for every 1 <= i <= k-1 and a_k = n, b is a list of k distinct integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for every 1 <= i <= k-1, d is a list of q integers such that 0 <= d_i <= n for every 1 <= i <= q.
