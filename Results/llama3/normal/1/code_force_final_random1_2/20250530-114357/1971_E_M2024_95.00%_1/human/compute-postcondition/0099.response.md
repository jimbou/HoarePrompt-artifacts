Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is 0, s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql, ql is ql - a[s - 1], l is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If a[s] is equal to ql, then the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves on to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.***
