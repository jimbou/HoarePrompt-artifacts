Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s-1] minus a[s-1], m is equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, l is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`, `s`, `stdin`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `ql` has been decremented by `a[s-1]` twice, and the value of `m` has been incremented by `b[s-1]` and the product of `bd[s]`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad[s]`.
