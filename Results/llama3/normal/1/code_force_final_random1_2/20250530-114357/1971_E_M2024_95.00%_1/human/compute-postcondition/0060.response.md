Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing 1 integer 0, bd is a list containing 1 integer 0, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is q, and nothing is being printed**

Here is a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `_` remains unchanged as 1. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `k` is also updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `q` remains unchanged as 0. The list `a` is updated to contain `n+1` integers read from the input, with the first element being 0. The list `b` is also updated to contain `n+1` integers read from the input, with the first element being 0. The list `ad` is updated to contain only one element, which is 0. The list `bd` is also updated to contain only one element, which is 0. The list `v` remains unchanged. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 1. The stdin contains `t-1` test cases. The value of `l` remains unchanged as `q`, which is 0. Nothing is being printed.
