To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The objects involved are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `a` is a list of at least 3 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The length of `a` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing three integers 0, a[1]-a[0], and a[2]-a[1], `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 3**
