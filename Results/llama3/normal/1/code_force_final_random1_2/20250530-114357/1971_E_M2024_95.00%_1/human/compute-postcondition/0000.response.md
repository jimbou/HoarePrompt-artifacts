Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q, where k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. The second line contains k integers a_i, where 1 <= a_i <= n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1 and a_k = n. The third line contains k integers b_i, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d, where 0 <= d <= n.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with four lines of input as described in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
