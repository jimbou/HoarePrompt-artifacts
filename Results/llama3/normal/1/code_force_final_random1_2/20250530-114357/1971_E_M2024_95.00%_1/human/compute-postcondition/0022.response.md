The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of list `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, list `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and list `a` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing two elements: 0 and ad[1] / bd[1], `i` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
