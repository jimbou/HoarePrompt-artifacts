Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the estimated values for each test case. The use of the bisect_left function from the bisect module is also correct, as it is used to find the insertion point for the query distance in the list of distances to maintain sorted order. The calculation of the estimated time is also correct, as it takes into account the speed of the car between each pair of signs.

Correctness: **True**
