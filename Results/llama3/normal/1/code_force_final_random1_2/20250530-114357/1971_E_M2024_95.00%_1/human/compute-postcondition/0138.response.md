Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing 4 elements: 0, `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, and `ad[3] / bd[3]`, `i` is 3, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `ql` is an integer equal to its original value minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`, and `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, and `stdin` contains `t-q-2` test cases.**

The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`, where `i` is 3. This means that the list `v` now contains four elements: 0, `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, and `ad[3] / bd[3]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
