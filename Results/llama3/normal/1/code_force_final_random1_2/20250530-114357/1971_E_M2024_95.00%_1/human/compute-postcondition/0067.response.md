Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing 1 integer 0, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, l is q, and nothing is being printed**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except for `i` and `ad`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the list `ad` will contain `n+1` integers, where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the differences between consecutive elements of the list `a`.
