Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the list `bd` now contains the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
