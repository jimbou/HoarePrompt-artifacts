Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ad` now contains the differences between consecutive elements of the list `a`, with the first element being 0. The loop has iterated over the entire list `a`, calculating the differences between each pair of adjacent elements and appending them to the list `ad`. The other variables remain unchanged.
