Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and `ad[i] / bd[i]` for i from 1 to n, `i` is n, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `ql` is an integer equal to its original value minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`, and `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, and `stdin` contains `t-q-2` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The value of `ql` has been decremented by the value of `a[s - 1]`. The value of `m` has been incremented by the value of `b[s - 1]` and then further incremented by the product of `bd[s]`, `ql` divided by `ad[s]`. The value of `a[s]` is still equal to `ql` if the if-else block was executed, otherwise, no action was taken. The rest of the code inside the current loop has been skipped, moving to the next iteration of the loop, and the integer value of `m` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: m is the sum of its original value and b[s - 1] plus the product of bd[s], ql, and the division of ad[s], i is 1, ql is the difference between its original value and a[s - 1], s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, a, b, bd, ad, and l are unchanged, and the integer value of m is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: m is the sum of its original value, b[s - 1], and the product of bd[s], ql, and the division of ql by ad[s], i is 1, ql is the integer value from stdin minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, a, b, bd, ad, and l are unchanged, the integer value of m is not printed, q is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, and the integer value of m is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
