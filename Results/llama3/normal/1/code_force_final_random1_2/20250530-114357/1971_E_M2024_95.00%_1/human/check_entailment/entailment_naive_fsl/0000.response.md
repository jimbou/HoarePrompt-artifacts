Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the speed of the car between each pair of points and uses this information to calculate the time it takes to reach a given point. The program handles all potential cases correctly, including when the query point is exactly at one of the known points, and when it is between two known points. The use of binary search to find the appropriate interval for the query point is also correct.

The program also correctly handles the case when the query point is at the end of the journey (i.e., at point n), by checking if the query point is equal to the last known point and returning the corresponding time.

The program's output matches the expected output for all the provided test cases, and it is unlikely that there are any other potential cases that the program does not handle correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
