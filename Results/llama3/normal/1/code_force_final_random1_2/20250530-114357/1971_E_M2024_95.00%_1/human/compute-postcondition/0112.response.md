Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s - 1], l is q, stdin contains t-q test cases, and s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql, and the integer value of m is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop has finished executing, and the value of `l` is equal to `q`, indicating that the loop has iterated `q` times. The value of `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, and the value of `ql` is its original value minus `a[s - 1]`. The value of `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`. The integer value of `m` is printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
