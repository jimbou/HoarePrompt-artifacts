To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `l` and `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is at least 1. Since `t` is an integer greater than 0 and stdin contains `t-1` test cases, it implies that `t` is at least 2 for the loop to execute (because there's at least one test case left to process). Also, `l` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `l` is 0**
