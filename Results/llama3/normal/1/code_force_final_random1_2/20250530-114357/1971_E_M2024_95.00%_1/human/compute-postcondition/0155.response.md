The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not affected, so the output state is: m is 0, i is 1, ql is an integer from stdin, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, a, b, bd, ad, and l are unchanged, and the value of b at index s is being printed, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.
