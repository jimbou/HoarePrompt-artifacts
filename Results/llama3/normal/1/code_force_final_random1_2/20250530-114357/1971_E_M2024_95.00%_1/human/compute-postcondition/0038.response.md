To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for l in range(q):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `l` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `q` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `n+1` integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing `n+1` integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing `n+1` elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `ql` is an integer equal to its original value minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is an integer equal to its original value plus `b[s-1]` plus `bd[s]` times `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `s` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `l` is 1**
