stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q, where k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. The second line contains k integers a_i, where 1 <= a_i <= n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1 and a_k = n. The third line contains k integers b_i, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1. Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d, where 0 <= d <= n.
