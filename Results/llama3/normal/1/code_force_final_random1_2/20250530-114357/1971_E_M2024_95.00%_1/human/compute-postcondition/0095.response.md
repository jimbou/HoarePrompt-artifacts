Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is 0, s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql, ql is ql - a[s - 1], l is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

Explanation: The first line sets `m` to 0. The second line sets `i` to 1. The third line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `ql`. The fourth line finds the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql` using the `bisect_left` function and assigns it to `s`. The value of `ql` is then updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`. The value of `m` is not affected by the last two lines, so it remains 0. The value of `i` is not affected by any of the lines, so it remains 1. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, and `l` are not affected by any of the lines, so they remain the same. Stdin now contains t-3 test cases.
