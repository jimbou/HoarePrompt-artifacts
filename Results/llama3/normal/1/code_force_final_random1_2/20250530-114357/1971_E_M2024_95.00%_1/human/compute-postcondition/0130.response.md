Output State: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is n, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `ql` is an integer equal to its original value minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`, `stdin` contains `t-q-2` test cases, and `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`, `v`, `m`, `ql`, `l`, `stdin`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The variable `b` is a list of at least `n+1` integers.
- The variable `bd` is a list containing `n+1` integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- The variable `i` is equal to `n`.
