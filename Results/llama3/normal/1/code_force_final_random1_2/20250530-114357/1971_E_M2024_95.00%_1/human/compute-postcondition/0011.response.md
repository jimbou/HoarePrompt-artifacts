To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(b)` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b)`). 

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ad` is a list containing n+1 integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is 1**
