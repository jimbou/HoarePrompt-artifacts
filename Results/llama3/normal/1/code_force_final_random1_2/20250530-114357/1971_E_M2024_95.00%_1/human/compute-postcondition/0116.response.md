Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing 1 integer: 0, bd is a list containing 1 integer: 0, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s - 1], l is q, stdin contains t-q-2 test cases, and s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql.**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `q`. Then, it reads `n+1` integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The lists `ad` and `bd` are initialized with a single element, 0. The value of `v` is not changed. The values of `i`, `m`, `ql`, `l`, and `s` are not changed. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
