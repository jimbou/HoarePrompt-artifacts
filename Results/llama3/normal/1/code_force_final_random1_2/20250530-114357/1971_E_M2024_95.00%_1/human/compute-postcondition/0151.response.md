To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for l in range(q):`. The only variable in the loop head is `l`, which is the loop counter.

Since the loop body has been skipped and we are moving to the next iteration, the value of `l` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`ql` has been decremented by the value of `a[s - 1]`, `m` has been incremented by the value of `b[s - 1]` and then further incremented by the product of `bd[s]`, `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `a[s]` is still equal to `ql` if the if-else block was executed, otherwise, no action was taken, `l` is incremented by 1**
