The only variable in the loop head is variable l, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable l and q. If l is less than q, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is 0, q is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, l must be increased by 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q must be greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, ad is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing n+1 integers: 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, v is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of a and b, i is 1, m is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], s is the index of the smallest element in a that is greater than or equal to ql, ql is ql - a[s - 1], l is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and this is printed: the integer value of m, which is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]**
