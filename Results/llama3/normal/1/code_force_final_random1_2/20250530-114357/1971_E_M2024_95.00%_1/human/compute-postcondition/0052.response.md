Postcondition: **The program either skips to the next iteration of the loop if the value at index `s` in list `a` is equal to `ql`, or it continues executing the next lines of code if the value at index `s` in list `a` is not equal to `ql`, maintaining the original values of all variables and lists, and the sorted order of list `a`.**
