Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing 4 integers: 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`, `bd` is a list containing 1 integer: 0, `v` is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is 3, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `ql` is an integer equal to its original value minus `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q`, `stdin` contains `t-q-2` test cases, and `s` is the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.**

The code appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since `i` is 3, this difference is `a[3] - a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
