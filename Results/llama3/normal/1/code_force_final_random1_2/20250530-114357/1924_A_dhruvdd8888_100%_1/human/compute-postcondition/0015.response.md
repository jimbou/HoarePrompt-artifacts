Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a', win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the first four characters of the string s if the third character i in the string s is a member of the set us, otherwise ans is a list containing the first three characters of the string s, and ps is 4 if the third character i in the string s is a member of the set us, otherwise ps is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` and `ps` are determined by whether the third character `i` in the string `s` is a member of the set `us`. If it is, `ans` contains the first four characters of `s` and `ps` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` contains the first three characters of `s` and `ps` is 3. The set `win` is cleared, and all other variables remain unchanged.
