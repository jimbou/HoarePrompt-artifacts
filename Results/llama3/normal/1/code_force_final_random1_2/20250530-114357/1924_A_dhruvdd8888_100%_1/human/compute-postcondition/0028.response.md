To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in us:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `us`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `us`. If `us` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `us` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the set `us`, and `i` is a member of the set `win`.

For the loop to execute again, `us` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next element in the set `us`.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a' that must have at least 2 elements, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are members of the set us and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set us, ps is the number of times k characters that are members of the set us appear in the string s, and i is the second element in the set us. ps is less than n, and 'NO' is printed.**
