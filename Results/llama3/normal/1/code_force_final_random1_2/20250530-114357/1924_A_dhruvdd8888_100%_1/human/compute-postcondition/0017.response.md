Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 3 characters, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a'. If the length of win is equal to k, then win is an empty set. If the third character i in the string s is a member of the set us, then ans is a list containing the first four characters of the string s and ps is 4. Otherwise, ans is a list containing the first three characters of the string s and ps is 3. If the length of win is not equal to k, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
