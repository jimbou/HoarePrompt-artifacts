You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^5), followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000), followed by a string s of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a', win is an empty set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are members of the set us and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set us, ps is the number of times k characters that are members of the set us appear in the string s, and i is the last character in the string s.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns and prints the string 'YES'
    #State: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a', win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are members of the set us and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set us, ps is the number of times k characters that are members of the set us appear in the string s, and i is the last character in the string s. ps is less than n
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The program returns a string that consists of all characters in string 's' that are members of the set 'us' and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set 'us', followed by the last element in the set 'us', and then 'a' repeated (n - length of the string - 1) times, if the last element in the set 'us' is not in the set 'win'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns and prints the string 'YES'

Case_2: The program returns a string that consists of all characters in string 's' that are members of the set 'us' and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set 'us', followed by the last element in the set 'us', and then 'a' repeated (n - length of the string - 1) times, if the last element in the set 'us' is not in the set 'win'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
