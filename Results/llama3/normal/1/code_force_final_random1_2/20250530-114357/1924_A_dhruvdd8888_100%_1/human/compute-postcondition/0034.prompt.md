Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a', win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are members of the set us and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set us, ps is the number of times k characters that are members of the set us appear in the string s, and i is the last character in the string s. ps is less than n, and 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a' that must have at least 1 element, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are members of the set us and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set us, ps is the number of times k characters that are members of the set us appear in the string s, and i is the first element in the set us. ps is less than n, and 'NO' is printed. The first element i of the set us is a member of the set win.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a' that must have at least 2 elements, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are members of the set us and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set us, ps is the number of times k characters that are members of the set us appear in the string s, and i is the second element in the set us. ps is less than n, and 'NO' is printed. If the second element in the set 'us' is not in the set 'win', the program returns a string that consists of all characters in string 's' that are members of the set 'us' and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set 'us', followed by the second element in the set 'us', and then 'a' repeated (n - length of the string - 1) times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program returns a string that consists of all characters in string 's' that are members of the set 'us' and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set 'us', followed by the third element in the set 'us', and then 'a' repeated (n - length of the string - 1) times, if the third element in the set 'us' is not in the set 'win'. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
