To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `us`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `us`. If `us` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `us` is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a', we can adjust its state to ensure it has at least one element. We can also adjust the state of `i` to be the first element in the set `us`.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a' that must have at least 1 element, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are members of the set us and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set us, ps is the number of times k characters that are members of the set us appear in the string s, and i is the first element in the set us. ps is less than n, and 'NO' is printed**
