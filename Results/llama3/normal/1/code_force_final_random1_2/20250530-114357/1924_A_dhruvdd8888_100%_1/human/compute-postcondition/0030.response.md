Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, us is a set of k lowercase English alphabets starting from 'a' that must have at least 2 elements, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are members of the set us and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set us, ps is the number of times k characters that are members of the set us appear in the string s, and i is the second element in the set us. ps is less than n, and 'NO' is printed. If the second element in the set 'us' is not in the set 'win', the program returns a string that consists of all characters in string 's' that are members of the set 'us' and appear after every k-1 characters that are members of the set 'us', followed by the second element in the set 'us', and then 'a' repeated (n - length of the string - 1) times.***
