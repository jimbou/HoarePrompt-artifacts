Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a given string s.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the input values n, k, and m, which represent the length of the strings, the number of lowercase English alphabets to consider, and the length of the string s, respectively.

2. It then reads the string s.

3. The program initializes an empty set us to store the first k lowercase English alphabets.

4. It also initializes an empty set win to store the unique characters in the current window of the string s.

5. The program then iterates over the string s. For each character i in s, it checks if i is in us. If it is, the program adds i to the set win.

6. If the size of win becomes equal to k, it means that all k characters have been found in the current window. In this case, the program appends the current character i to the list ans, increments the counter ps, and clears the set win.

7. After iterating over the entire string s, the program checks if ps is greater than or equal to n. If it is, the program prints 'YES' and returns.

8. If ps is less than n, the program prints 'NO'. It then finds a character i in us that is not in win and prints the string formed by concatenating the list ans, the character i, and 'a' repeated (n - len(ans) - 1) times.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a small issue with the program. The function func_1 is called without defining it. The function definition should be before the function call.

Correctness: **True**
