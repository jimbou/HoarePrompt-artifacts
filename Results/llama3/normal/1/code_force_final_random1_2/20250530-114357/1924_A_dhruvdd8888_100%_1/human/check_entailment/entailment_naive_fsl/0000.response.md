Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3 3 10
aabbccabab

The program will output:

NO
ccc

However, the correct output should be:

NO
aab

The program is not correctly generating the string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s. It is simply appending 'a' to the end of the string, which is not correct.

The program needs to be modified to correctly generate the string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.
