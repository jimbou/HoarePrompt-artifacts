Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s. If the answer is NO, it also correctly prints a string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.

The program uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the unique characters in the current window. It iterates over the string s and adds each character to the window. If the size of the window becomes equal to k, it means that all k unique characters are present in the current window, so it adds the last character of the window to the answer and resets the window. If the length of the answer becomes greater than or equal to n, it means that all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s, so it prints YES. Otherwise, it prints NO and a string that completes the pattern to meet the minimum requirement of n occurrences.

Correctness: **True**
