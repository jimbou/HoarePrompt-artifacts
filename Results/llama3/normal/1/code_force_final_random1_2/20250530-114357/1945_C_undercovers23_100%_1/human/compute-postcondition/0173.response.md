Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. `final` is a list containing the second element of `lst` and the second element of `lst` again.**

In this output state, all variables retain their previous values except for `final`, which now contains the second element of `lst` appended to its previous value, which was already the second element of `lst`.
