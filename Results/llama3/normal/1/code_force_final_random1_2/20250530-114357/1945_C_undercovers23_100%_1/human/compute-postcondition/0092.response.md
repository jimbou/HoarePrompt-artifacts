Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is None, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`, `c1` is the percentage of '1's in string `s`, and `n` must be at least 3. If `s[i]` is '0', then `z` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `o` is increased by 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing the integer `i + 1` appended to its previous value.**
