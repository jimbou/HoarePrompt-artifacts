Postcondition: ***`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element `elem` in `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the second element of `lst` twice. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.***
