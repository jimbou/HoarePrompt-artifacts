Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in the original `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in the original `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, and `c1` is the percentage of '1's in `s`, calculated as `one` multiplied by 100 and divided by `n`.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for the new variable `c1`, which is calculated based on the values of `one` and `n`. The value of `c1` is the percentage of '1's in the string `s`, calculated as `one` multiplied by 100 and divided by `n`.
