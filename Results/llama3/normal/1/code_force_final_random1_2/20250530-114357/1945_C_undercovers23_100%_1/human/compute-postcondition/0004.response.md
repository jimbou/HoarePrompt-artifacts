Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an even integer, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`, which is an integer since `n` is even. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
