Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in the list, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `c1` is the percentage of '1's in string `s`, `n` must be at least 2, `lst` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the third element in the list. Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.**
