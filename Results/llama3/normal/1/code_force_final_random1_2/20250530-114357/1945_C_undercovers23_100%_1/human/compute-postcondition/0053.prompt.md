Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `lst` is a list containing integers `i + 1` for each `i` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, and `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `lst` is a list containing integers `i + 1` for each `i` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 1 element, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element in `lst`, and `elem` is the first element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` contains the first element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `lst` is a list containing integers `i + 1` for each `i` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element in `lst` and the second element in `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst` is equal to `mini`, otherwise `final` contains the first element in `lst`, and `elem` is the second element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `lst` is a list containing integers `i + 1` for each `i` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element in `lst`, the second element in `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst` is equal to `mini`, otherwise the first element in `lst`, and the third element in `lst`, and `elem` is the third element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` contains the first element in `lst`, the second element in `lst`, and the third element in `lst`. Otherwise, `final` contains the first element in `lst`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
