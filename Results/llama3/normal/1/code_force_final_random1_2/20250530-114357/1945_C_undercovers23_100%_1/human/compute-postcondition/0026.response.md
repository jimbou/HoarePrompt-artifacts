The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s` and is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `z` remains the same, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `i+1` characters of string `s`, and `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last `n-i-1` characters of string `s`.**
