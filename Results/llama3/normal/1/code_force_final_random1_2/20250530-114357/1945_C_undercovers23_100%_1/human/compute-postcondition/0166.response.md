Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is not empty, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` has been fully processed, the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` are accurate, the percentages of '0's and '1's are accurately calculated, the list `lst` is not empty, the variable `ele` is the last element in `lst`, and the variable `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`.
