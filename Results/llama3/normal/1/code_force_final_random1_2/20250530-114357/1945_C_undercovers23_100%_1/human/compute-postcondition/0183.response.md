Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in the original `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in the original `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini` and also contains 0, and `c1` is 50 or more.**

In this output state, the value of `final` has been updated to include 0, in addition to the elements it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged. The percentage of '1's in `s`, `c1`, is still 50 or more.
