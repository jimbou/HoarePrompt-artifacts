Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, _ is 2, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s, zero is 0, one is 0, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and each element in the list, i is n-2, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s, one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string s, ele is the last element in the list, c1 is the percentage of '1's in string s, n is an integer at least 2, lst is an empty list, elem is the last element in the list, final is a list containing the last element in the list in sorted order if the absolute difference between pk and elem is equal to mini, otherwise it contains 0 if the percentage of '1's in string s is 50 or more, otherwise it contains n, and the first element of the list final is printed, stdin contains no input. If n is even, pk is an integer equal to n / 2. If n is odd, pk is an integer equal to n / 2. The first element of the list final is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, _ is 2, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s, zero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '1', otherwise it is 0, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and each element in the list, i is 0, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s, one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string s, ele is the last element in the list, c1 is the percentage of '1's in string s, n is an integer at least 2, lst is a list containing the last element in the list in sorted order if the absolute difference between pk and elem is equal to mini, otherwise it contains 0 if the percentage of '1's in string s is 50 or more, otherwise it contains n, and the first element of the list final is printed, stdin contains no input. If n is even, pk is an integer equal to n / 2. If n is odd, pk is an integer equal to n / 2. The first element of the list final is printed. The value of z is increased by 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0'. If the percentage of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s is greater than or equal to 50 and the percentage of '1's in the last character of string s is greater than or equal to 50, then i is 1, lst is a list containing the integer 1, and the first element of the list final is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program has processed the character at index `i` in string `s`. The number of '0's and '1's in string `s` remains unchanged. The percentage of '0's in the string is now `zero_perc`, calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. The percentage of '1's in the string is now `one_perc`, calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, the list `lst` now contains the index `i + 1`. All other variables, including the number of test cases, the middle index of the string, the list of characters, the minimum difference between the middle index and each element in the list, and the list containing the last element in sorted order or 0 or `n` based on certain conditions, remain unchanged. The program still prints the first element of the list `final` if certain conditions are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program has processed the character at index `i + 2` in string `s` if `s[i]` is '0', or `i + 1` if `s[i]` is not '0'. The number of '0's in string `s` is now `zero + 1` if `s[i]` is '0', or remains unchanged if `s[i]` is not '0'. The number of '1's in string `s` remains unchanged if `s[i]` is '0', or is decreased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'. The percentage of '0's in the string is now `(zero + 1) * 100 // (i + 3)` if `s[i]` is '0', or `zero * 100 // (i + 2)` if `s[i]` is not '0'. The percentage of '1's in the string is now `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 3)` if `s[i]` is '0', or `(o - one - 1) * 100 // (n - i - 2)` if `s[i]` is not '0'. If both percentages are greater than or equal to 50, the list `lst` now contains the index `i + 3` if `s[i]` is '0', or `i + 2` if `s[i]` is not '0'. The variable `zero_perc` is now set to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, and the variable `one_perc` is now set to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If both percentages are greater than or equal to 50 and the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` is met, the list `lst` now also contains the index `i + 1`. All other variables, including the number of test cases, the middle index of the string, the list of characters, the minimum difference between the middle index and each element in the list, and the list containing the last element in sorted order or 0 or `n` based on certain conditions, remain unchanged. The program still prints the first element of the list `final` if certain conditions are met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
