To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which is `ele` and `lst`. The loop will execute if `lst` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `lst` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is not empty, `ele` is the first element in `lst`**
