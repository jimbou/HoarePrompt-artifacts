Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in the original `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in the original `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini` and also contains the length of `s`, and `c1` is the percentage of '1's in `s`, calculated as `one` multiplied by 100 and divided by `n`. The percentage of '1's in `s` is less than 50.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` has been fully processed, and the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` are accurate. The percentages of '0's and '1's in `s` are also accurate. The list `lst` is still empty, and `ele` is still the last element of the original list. The minimum absolute difference between `pk` and the elements in the original list is still `mini`. The list `final` now contains all elements from the original list that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, and also contains the length of `s`. The percentage of '1's in `s` is still less than 50, and it is calculated as the count of '1's multiplied by 100 and divided by the length of `s`.
