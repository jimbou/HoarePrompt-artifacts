Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is not empty, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`**.

In this output state, the values of `s`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, and `ele` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. The only change is in the value of `mini`, which is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
