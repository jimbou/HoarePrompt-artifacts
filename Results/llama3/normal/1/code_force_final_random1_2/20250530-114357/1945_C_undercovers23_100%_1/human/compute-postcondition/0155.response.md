Postcondition: **The program has processed the character at index `i + 2` in string `s` if `s[i]` is '0', or `i + 1` if `s[i]` is not '0'. The number of '0's in string `s` is now `zero + 1` if `s[i]` is '0', or remains unchanged if `s[i]` is not '0'. The number of '1's in string `s` remains unchanged if `s[i]` is '0', or is decreased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'. The percentage of '0's in the string is now `(zero + 1) * 100 // (i + 3)` if `s[i]` is '0', or `zero * 100 // (i + 2)` if `s[i]` is not '0'. The percentage of '1's in the string is now `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 3)` if `s[i]` is '0', or `(o - one - 1) * 100 // (n - i - 2)` if `s[i]` is not '0'. If both percentages are greater than or equal to 50, the list `lst` now contains the index `i + 3` if `s[i]` is '0', or `i + 2` if `s[i]` is not '0'. All other variables, including the number of test cases, the middle index of the string, the list of characters, the minimum difference between the middle index and each element in the list, and the list containing the last element in sorted order or 0 or `n` based on certain conditions, remain unchanged. The program still prints the first element of the list `final` if certain conditions are met.**
