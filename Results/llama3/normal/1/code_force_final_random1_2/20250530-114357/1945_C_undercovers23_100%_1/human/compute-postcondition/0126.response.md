The code prints the first element of the list `final`. 

The list `final` is determined by the following conditions:

1. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the last element in the list in sorted order.

2. If the percentage of '1's in string `s` is 50 or more, `final` is a list containing 0.

3. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing `n`.

Since the exact values of `pk`, `elem`, `mini`, `s`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `final[0]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first element of the list `final` which is determined by the conditions above.

Output: **The first element of the list final (which is either the last element in the list, 0, or n, depending on the conditions)**
