Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in the list, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `final` is an empty list, `c1` is the percentage of '1's in string `s`, and `n` must be at least 2. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains all the integers from 1 to `n-1` that satisfy the condition. The value of `z` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise the value of `o` is increased by 1, `lst` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in the list, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `c1` is the percentage of '1's in string `s`, `n` must be at least 2, `lst` must have at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element in the list. Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in the list, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `c1` is the percentage of '1's in string `s`, `n` must be at least 2, `lst` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the second element in the list. Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in the list, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `c1` is the percentage of '1's in string `s`, `n` must be at least 2, `lst` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the third element in the list. Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
