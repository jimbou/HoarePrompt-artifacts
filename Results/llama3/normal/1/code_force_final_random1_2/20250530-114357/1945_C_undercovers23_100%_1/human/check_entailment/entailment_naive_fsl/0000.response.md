Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of houses is odd. In this case, the program calculates `pk` as `n / 2`, which will be a float, but then it uses `pk` as if it were an integer. This can lead to incorrect results when calculating the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

For example, if `n` is 5, `pk` will be 2.5, but the program will use it as 2 when calculating the absolute difference. This can result in an incorrect answer.

To fix this, the program should calculate `pk` as `n // 2` when `n` is odd, to ensure that it is an integer.
