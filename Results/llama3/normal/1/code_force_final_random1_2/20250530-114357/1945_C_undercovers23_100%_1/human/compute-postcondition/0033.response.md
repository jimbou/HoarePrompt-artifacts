Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, _ is 0, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s, zero is the number of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s, one is the number of '1's in the first n-1 characters of string s, lst is a list containing the integer i + 1 for each i where zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, mini is 100000000, i is n-2, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s, and one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string s.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.
- The length of the string `n` remains unchanged.
- The string `s` remains unchanged.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `pk` remains unchanged.
- The list of characters in the string `sl` remains unchanged.
- The number of '1's in the string `o` remains unchanged.
- The number of '0's in the string `z` remains unchanged.
- The variable `zero` now represents the total number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of the string.
- The variable `one` now represents the total number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of the string.
- The list `lst` contains the indices `i+1` where the percentage of '0's in the first `i+1` characters and the percentage of '1's in the last `n-i-1` characters are both greater than or equal to 50.
- The variable `mini` remains unchanged.
- The loop counter `i` is now `n-2`.
- The variable `zero_perc` now represents the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of the string.
- The variable `one_perc` now represents the percentage of '1's in the last character of the string.
