Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s` and is increased by 1, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `i+1` characters of string `s`, and `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last `n-i-1` characters of string `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `z` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0'.
