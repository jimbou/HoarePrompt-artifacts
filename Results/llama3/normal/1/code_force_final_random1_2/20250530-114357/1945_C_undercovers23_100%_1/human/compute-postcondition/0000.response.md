Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5). The second line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` within the range of 3 to 3*10^5, and the second line contains a string `a` of length `n`, composed only of the characters '0' and '1'.
