Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `lst` is a list containing integers `i + 1` for each `i` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`, and `c1` is the percentage of '1's in string `s`. The current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50. `final` now contains an additional element 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the list `final` now contains an additional element, 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
