Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, _ is 0, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s, zero is the number of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s, one is the number of '1's in the first n-1 characters of string s, lst is a list containing the integer i + 1 for each i where zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, mini is 100000000, i is n-2, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s, and one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string s.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least 1 integer `i + 1` for each `i` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, and `ele` is the first element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 integers `i + 1` for each `i` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` or the second element in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, and `ele` is the second element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least 3 integers `i + 1` for each `i` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst`, the second element in `lst`, or the third element in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, and `ele` is the third element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
