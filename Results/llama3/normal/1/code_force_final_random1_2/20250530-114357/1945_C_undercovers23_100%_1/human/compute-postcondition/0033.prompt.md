Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, _ is 0, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, and mini is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer 1 if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, `zero_perc` is 0, and `one_perc` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s` and is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `z` remains the same, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `i+1` characters of string `s`, and `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last `n-i-1` characters of string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 2, s is a string, _ is 0, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s and is increased by 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise z remains the same, zero is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise zero is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i of string s is not '0', otherwise one is 0, lst is a list containing the integer i + 1 if zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise lst is an empty list. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then lst contains the integer i + 1. mini is 100000000, i is 2, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first i+1 characters of string s, and one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last n-i-1 characters of string s. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then z is increased by 1. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then one is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
