Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It calculates the percentage of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the index at which the percentage of 0s is at least 50% and the percentage of 1s is at least 50%. If such an index is found, it returns the index with the minimum absolute difference from n/2. If no such index is found, it returns 0 if the percentage of 1s in the string is 50 or more, and n otherwise. The function prints the result for each test case.**
