Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is 100000000, i is n-2, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s, one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string s, ele is None, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and each element is equal to mini, and c1 is the percentage of '1's in string s.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer 1 if the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s` is at least 50 and the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s` is at least 50, otherwise it is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is None, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`, `c1` is the percentage of '1's in string `s`, and `n` must be at least 2. The value of `z` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise the value of `o` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s, zero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if s[i] is not '0', otherwise it is 0, mini is 100000000, i is 1, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s, one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string s, ele is None, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and each element is equal to mini, c1 is the percentage of '1's in string s, and n must be at least 3. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then lst is a list containing the integer i + 1 appended to its previous value. The value of z is increased by 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise the value of o is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, _ is 1, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s, zero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if s[i] is not '0', otherwise it is 0, mini is 100000000, i is 2, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first n characters of string s, one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last n-1 characters of string s, ele is None, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and each element is equal to mini, c1 is the percentage of '1's in string s, and n must be at least 3. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then lst contains i + 1 which is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
