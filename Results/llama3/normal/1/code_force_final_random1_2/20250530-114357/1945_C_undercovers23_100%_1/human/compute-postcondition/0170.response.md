Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`, and the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` has been fully processed, and the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` are accurately stored in `zero` and `one`, respectively. The percentages of '0's and '1's in `s` are also accurately calculated and stored in `zero_perc` and `one_perc`, respectively. The list `lst` still has at least one element, and `ele` is still the last element in `lst`. The minimum value `mini` is still the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. The list `final` now contains the first element of `lst`, which is also the element that has the minimum absolute difference with `pk`.
