Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element `elem` in `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the third element of `lst` three times. Otherwise, `final` contains one more element which is the third element of `lst`.**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, and `mini` remain unchanged. However, the value of `final` has been updated. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element `elem` in `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` now contains the third element of `lst` three times. Otherwise, `final` now contains one more element which is the third element of `lst`.
