Postcondition: ***`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in the original `lst`. If `final` was originally empty, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in the original `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`. Additionally, if the percentage of '1's in `s` is 50 or more, `final` also contains 0; otherwise, it contains the length of `s`.***
