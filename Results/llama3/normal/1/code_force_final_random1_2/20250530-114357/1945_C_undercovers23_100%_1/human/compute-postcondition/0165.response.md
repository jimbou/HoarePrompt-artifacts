Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The state of `s` remains fully processed, and the counts and percentages of '0's and '1's in `s` are still accurate. The list `lst` still has at least 3 elements, and `ele` is still the third element in `lst`.
