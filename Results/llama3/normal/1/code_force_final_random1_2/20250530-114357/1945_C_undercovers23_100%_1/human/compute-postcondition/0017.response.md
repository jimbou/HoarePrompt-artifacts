Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer 1, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, and the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `lst` now contains the integer 1, which is the result of appending `i + 1` to the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
