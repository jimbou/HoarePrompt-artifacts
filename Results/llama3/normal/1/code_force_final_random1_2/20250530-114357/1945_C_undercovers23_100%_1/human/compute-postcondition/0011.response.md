Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `_` is 0, `pk` is an integer equal to `n` / 2 if `n` is even, or an integer if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `zero` has been incremented by 1 because the current value of `s[i]` is '0'. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
