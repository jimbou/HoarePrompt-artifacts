Postcondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, _ is 2, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s, zero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '1', otherwise it is 0, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and each element in the list, i is 0, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first n-1 characters of string s, one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string s, ele is the last element in the list, c1 is the percentage of '1's in string s, n is an integer at least 2, lst is an empty list, elem is the last element in the list, final is a list containing the last element in the list in sorted order if the absolute difference between pk and elem is equal to mini, otherwise it contains 0 if the percentage of '1's in string s is 50 or more, otherwise it contains n, and the first element of the list final is printed, stdin contains no input. If n is even, pk is an integer equal to n / 2. If n is odd, pk is an integer equal to n / 2. The first element of the list final is printed. The value of z is increased by 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0'. The current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50.**
