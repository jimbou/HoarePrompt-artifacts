Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is not empty, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` in `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element `elem` in `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the second element of `lst` twice. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element `elem` in `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the third element of `lst` three times. Otherwise, `final` contains one more element which is the third element of `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
