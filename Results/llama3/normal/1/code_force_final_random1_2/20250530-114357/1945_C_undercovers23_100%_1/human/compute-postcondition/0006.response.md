Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an odd integer, s is a string, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, pk is an integer**

In this output state, the value of pk is calculated as n divided by 2. Since n is an odd integer, the result of this division will always be an integer. For example, if n is 5, pk will be 2. If n is 7, pk will be 3. The values of the other variables, t, s, and _, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
