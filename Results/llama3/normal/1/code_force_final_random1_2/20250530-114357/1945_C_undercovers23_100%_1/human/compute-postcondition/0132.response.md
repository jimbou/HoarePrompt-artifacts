Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `pk` is an integer equal to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters in string `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in string `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in the list, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of string `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the last character of string `s`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `c1` is the percentage of '1's in string `s`, `n` is an integer at least 2, `lst` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `elem` is the last element in the list, `final` is a list containing the last element in the list in sorted order if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, otherwise it contains 0 if the percentage of '1's in string `s` is 50 or more, otherwise it contains `n`, and the first element of the list `final` is printed, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `pk` has been updated to be equal to `n / 2`, which means it is now an integer equal to half of the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
