Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, s is a string, _ is 0, pk is an integer equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in string s, o is the number of '1's in string s, z is the number of '0's in string s and is increased by 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise z remains the same, zero is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise zero is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i of string s is not '0', otherwise one is 0, lst is a list containing the integer 1 if zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise lst is an empty list, mini is 100000000, i is 1, zero_perc is the percentage of '0's in the first i+1 characters of string s, and one_perc is the percentage of '1's in the last n-i-1 characters of string s.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `_`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini` remain unchanged. The values of `i`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` are updated based on the given code. The variable `i` is now 1, and `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated based on the percentages of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to the current index `i`.
