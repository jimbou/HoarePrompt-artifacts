Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid, as described in the problem statement. The program iterates through the string, keeping track of the count of 0s and 1s, and checks if the percentage of 0s and 1s is at least 50% at each position. If such a position is found, it calculates the absolute difference from n/2 and keeps track of the minimum difference. If no such position is found, it returns 0 if the percentage of 1s in the string is 50 or more, and n otherwise. The program also handles the case where the length of the string is even or odd correctly.

Correctness: **True**
