Output State: **`s` has been fully processed, `zero` and `one` accurately count the '0's and '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` accurately calculate the percentages, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in the original `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in the original `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their previous values, except for `final`, which is now sorted in ascending order. The sorting operation does not change the elements in `final`, but rather rearranges them to be in a specific order. The other variables, such as `s`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, `ele`, `mini`, and `pk`, remain unchanged.
