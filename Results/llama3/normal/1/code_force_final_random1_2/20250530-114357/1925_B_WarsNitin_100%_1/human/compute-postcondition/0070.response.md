Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 3, `ans` is at least 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be at least 3, which is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i` (which is 3). The other variables remain unchanged.
