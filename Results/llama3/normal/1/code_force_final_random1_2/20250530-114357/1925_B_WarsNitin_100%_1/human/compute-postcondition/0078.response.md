Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the final output state is that `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, `q` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` which is `ans` is being printed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state is that `x` and `n` are integers, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the given conditions, `q` is equal to the initial number of test cases `t`, the input buffer `stdin` is empty, `i` is the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer, and the maximum divisor `ans` is being printed.
