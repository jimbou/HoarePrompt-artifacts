The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3**
