Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `ans` (which is 1) and `i` (which is 1), `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1. If `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0, and `x` divided by `i` is greater than 0, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current value of `ans` and `x // i` (which is at least 1). Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains the same.***
