The only variables in the loop head are variables  q and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q` and the input. If `q` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 0, `input()` is unknown. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be increased by 1 and the input must be at least 1.
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, `q` is 1, `input()` is at least 1**
