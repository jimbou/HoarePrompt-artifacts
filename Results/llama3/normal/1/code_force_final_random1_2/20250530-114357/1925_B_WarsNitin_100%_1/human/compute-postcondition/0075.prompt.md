Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, ans is 1, q is 2, stdin is empty, i is not defined, the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0 is not being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `ans` (which is 1) and `i` (which is 1), `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0, and `x` divided by `i` is greater than 0, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current value of `ans` and `x // i` (which is at least 1). Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 2. If `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 2), then if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2. If `x` is not divisible by `i` (which is 2), then `ans` remains 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 3)`. Otherwise, `ans` is at least 3. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
