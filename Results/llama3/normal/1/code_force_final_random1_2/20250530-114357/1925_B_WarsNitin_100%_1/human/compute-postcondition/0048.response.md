Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3. If `x` is a multiple of 3, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3` if `x - n * (x // 3)` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x - n * (x // 3)` is a multiple of `x // 3`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
