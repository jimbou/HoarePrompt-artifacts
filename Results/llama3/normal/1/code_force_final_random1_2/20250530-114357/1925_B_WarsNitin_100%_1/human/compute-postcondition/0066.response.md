Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 2. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does nothing.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (2) and the result of the division of `x` by `i` (i.e., `x // i`). The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` still determine whether the program executes the if part or does nothing.
