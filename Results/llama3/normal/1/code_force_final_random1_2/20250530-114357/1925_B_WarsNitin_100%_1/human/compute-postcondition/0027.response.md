Output State: **x is an integer, n is an integer, ans is 1, q is 1, stdin contains no input**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to x and n, respectively. Since stdin was initially empty, it now contains no input. The second line resets the value of ans to 1, regardless of its previous value. The value of q remains unchanged at 1.
