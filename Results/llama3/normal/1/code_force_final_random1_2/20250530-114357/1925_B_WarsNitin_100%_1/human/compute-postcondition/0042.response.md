Postcondition: ***x is an integer greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, i is 2. If x is divisible by i, then if x - n * (x // i) is greater than or equal to 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) is divisible by (x // i), then ans is the maximum of its previous value and x // 2. Otherwise, the value of ans remains unchanged. If x is not divisible by i, then the value of ans remains unchanged.***
