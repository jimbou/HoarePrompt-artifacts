To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `int(sqrt(x))` is still at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `ans` (which is 1) and `i` (which is 2), `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 2.**
