Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 2. Since the previous value of `ans` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is at least 2.
