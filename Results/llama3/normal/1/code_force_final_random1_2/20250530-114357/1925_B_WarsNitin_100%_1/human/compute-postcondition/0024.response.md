The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Since `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, the square root of `x` will be a value between 1 and 31.62 (inclusive). The maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` will be the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x` that divides `x` without leaving a remainder.

Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x**
