Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 3, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 3)`. If `x - n * 3` is non-negative and divisible by 3, then `ans` is at least 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still an integer greater than 1, `n` is still an integer, `q` is still 2, `stdin` is still empty, `i` is still 3, and the square root of `x` is at least 3. The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by 3. Additionally, if `x` minus `n` times 3 is non-negative and divisible by 3, then `ans` is at least 3.
