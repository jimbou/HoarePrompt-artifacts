The code prints the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0.
Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0**
