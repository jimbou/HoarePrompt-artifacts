Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 2. If `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 2), then if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2. If `x` is not divisible by `i` (which is 2), then `ans` remains 2.***
