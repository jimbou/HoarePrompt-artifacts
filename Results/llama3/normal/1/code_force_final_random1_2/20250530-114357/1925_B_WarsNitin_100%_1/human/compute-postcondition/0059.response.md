Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `ans` (which is 1) and `i` (which is 1), `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1, the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is not being printed. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current value of `ans` and `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` divided by `i` is greater than 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by `i` divided by `x` divided by `i` is 0.***
