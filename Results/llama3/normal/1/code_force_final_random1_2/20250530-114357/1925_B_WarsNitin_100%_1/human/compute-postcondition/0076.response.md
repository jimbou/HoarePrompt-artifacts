The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum divisor of `x` that meets the specified conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the given conditions)**
