Output: **x is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0, q is 1, stdin contains no input, i is equal to the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer plus 1, and the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0 is being printed**
