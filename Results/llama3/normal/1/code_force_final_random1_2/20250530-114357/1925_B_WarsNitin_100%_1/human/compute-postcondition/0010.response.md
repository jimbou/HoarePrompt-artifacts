Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // i` if the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and this difference is also divisible by `i`, and `x // i` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
