Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` remains 0, and `stdin` remains empty. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. This means that `ans` will be the largest number that divides `x` without leaving a remainder and is also less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
