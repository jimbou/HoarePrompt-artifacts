Output State: **x is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0, q is 1, stdin contains no input, i is equal to the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer plus 1.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. The values of `x`, `n`, `q`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is equal to the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer plus 1, which is the final value of the loop counter.
