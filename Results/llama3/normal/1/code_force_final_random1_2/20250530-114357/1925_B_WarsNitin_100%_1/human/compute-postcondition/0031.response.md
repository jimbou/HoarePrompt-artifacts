Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`, `q` is 1, stdin contains no input, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is divisible by `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (1) and the current value of `i` (1). Since `i` is 1, `ans` remains 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
