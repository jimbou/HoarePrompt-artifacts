The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and the value of sqrt(x). If i is less than sqrt(x), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, x is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, stdin contains no input. For the loop to execute again, i must be increased by 1, so i is 2, and for the loop to execute again, x must be greater than or equal to 4 (because sqrt(x) must be greater than or equal to 2).
State: **x is an integer greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, i is 2**
