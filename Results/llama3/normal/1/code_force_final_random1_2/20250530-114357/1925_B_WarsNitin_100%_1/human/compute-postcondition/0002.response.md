To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and the result of `int(sqrt(x))`. The loop will execute if `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1. Since `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `int(sqrt(x))` will be at least 1 if `x` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be at least 1. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, its initial value should be 1.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `ans` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
