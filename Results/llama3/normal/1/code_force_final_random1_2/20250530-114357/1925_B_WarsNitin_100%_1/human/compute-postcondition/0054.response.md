To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `sqrt(x)`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop will execute if `i` is within the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x))` (inclusive).
2. Since `x` is an integer greater than 1, `sqrt(x)` will be a real number greater than 1.
3. To ensure `i` is within the range, we need to adjust the state of `x` to guarantee that `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1.
4. Since `x` is already an integer greater than 1, we can conclude that `int(sqrt(x))` will be at least 1.


Therefore, the adjusted state is:


State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1, the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is not being printed**
