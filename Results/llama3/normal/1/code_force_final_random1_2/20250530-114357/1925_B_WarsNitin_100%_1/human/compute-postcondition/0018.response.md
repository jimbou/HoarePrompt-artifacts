Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `i` is 3, `ans` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (which was not specified) and the value of `i`, which is 3. Since `ans` is now equal to 3, we can conclude that its previous value was either less than or equal to 3. The values of `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty.
