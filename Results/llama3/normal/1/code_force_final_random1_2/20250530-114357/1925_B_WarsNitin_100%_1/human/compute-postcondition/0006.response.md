Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `ans` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, if the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and this difference is also divisible by `i`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if part and the state of the variables remains the same.***
