Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `ans` is either the previous value of `ans` or 3, whichever is larger.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`, which is 3. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is still 3.
