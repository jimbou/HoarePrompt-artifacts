Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // i`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and this difference is also divisible by `i`. The current value of `x // i` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (1) and the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the divisibility of `x` and the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` still hold.
