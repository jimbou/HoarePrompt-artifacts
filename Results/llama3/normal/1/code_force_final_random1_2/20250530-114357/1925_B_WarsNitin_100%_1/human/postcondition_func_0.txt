This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers x and n. It calculates and prints the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0 for each case.
