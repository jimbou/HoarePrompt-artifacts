Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is even and the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is met, then `ans` is either 2 or `x // 2`, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
