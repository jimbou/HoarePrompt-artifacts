The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `x` and `n`, and initializes `ans` to 1. 

The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `n`. Since `t` is the only integer in the input, `x` becomes `t` and `n` becomes 0. The second line initializes `ans` to 1.

Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, n is 0, ans is 1, stdin is empty**
