Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is 2, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 2, which is the maximum of the current value of `ans` (which was 1) and `i` (which is 2). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
