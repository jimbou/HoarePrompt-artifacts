Postcondition: ***x is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, stdin contains no input. If x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0, then the current value of ans is the maximum of 1 and i, q is 1, and the current value of i is 1. Otherwise, the values of ans, q, and i remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of (x - n * (x // i)) is greater than or equal to 0, (x // i) is greater than 0, and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)) equals 0***
