The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `ans` is initially 1 and `i` is 1, the value of `ans` remains 1. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `ans` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and this difference is also divisible by `i`.**
