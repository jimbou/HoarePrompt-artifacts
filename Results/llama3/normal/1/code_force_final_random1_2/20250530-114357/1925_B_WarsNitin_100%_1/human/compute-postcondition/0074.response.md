Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 3)`. Otherwise, `ans` is at least 3. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then no changes are made.***
