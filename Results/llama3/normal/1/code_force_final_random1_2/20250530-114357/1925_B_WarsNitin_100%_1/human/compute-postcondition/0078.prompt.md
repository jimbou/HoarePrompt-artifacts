Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x).
Code of the loop:
for q in range(int(input())):
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x
                 // i) == 0:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, `n` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: x is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, ans is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0, q is 1, stdin contains no input, i is equal to the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer plus 1, and the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` which is `ans` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
