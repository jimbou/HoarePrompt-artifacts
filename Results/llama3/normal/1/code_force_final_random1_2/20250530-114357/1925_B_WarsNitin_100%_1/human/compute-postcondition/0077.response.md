Output: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` which is `ans` is being printed**
