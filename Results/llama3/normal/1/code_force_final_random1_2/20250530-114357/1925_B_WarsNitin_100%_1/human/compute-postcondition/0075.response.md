Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, `q` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `int(sqrt(x))`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` remains an integer greater than 1, `n` remains an integer, and `q` remains 2. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the given conditions. The value of `i` is updated to be the square root of `x`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
