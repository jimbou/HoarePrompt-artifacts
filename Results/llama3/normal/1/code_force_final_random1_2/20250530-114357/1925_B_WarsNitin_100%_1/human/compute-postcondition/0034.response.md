Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains no input, (x - n * (x // i)) is greater than or equal to 0, (x // i) is greater than 0, and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)) equals 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains the same, `n` remains the same, the value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`, `q` remains 1, `i` remains 1, there is no input in stdin, and the conditions (x - n * (x // i)) is greater than or equal to 0, (x // i) is greater than 0, and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)) equals 0 still hold.
