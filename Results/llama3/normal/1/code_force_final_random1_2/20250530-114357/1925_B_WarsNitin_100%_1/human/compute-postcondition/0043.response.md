The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `x` remains unchanged.
State: **x is an integer greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, i is 3**
