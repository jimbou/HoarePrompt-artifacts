Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and is at least `lk+1`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `lk-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the value `2 ** i`, where `i` is `lk`. The value of `i` has also been updated to `lk-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
