This function generates a string of space-separated powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of the input integer n, which is between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive). If the input integer k is 1, the function returns a string containing two lines, the first line with the string '1' and the second line with the string '2', representing the number of digits in the binary representation of n and the value of n itself, respectively. Otherwise, the function returns a string of space-separated powers of 2, including k-1-sum(ans), k+1, and 2*k+1, where ans is a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) and lk is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.
