Output State: **The output of `func_14()` is printed to the console as a string followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `_` is equal to the number of iterations minus one, and the output of `func_14()` is written to the console without buffering.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the output of `func_14()` will have been printed to the console as a string followed by a newline character for each iteration. The value returned by `func_10()` will be a non-negative integer that is greater than or equal to the number of iterations that occurred. The variable `_` will have a value equal to the number of iterations minus one. Additionally, the output of `func_14()` will have been written to the console without buffering, meaning that the output will be displayed immediately without being stored in a buffer.
