The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0, `_` is 0. So for the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 1.
State: **`func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the output of `func_14()` is printed to the console as a string followed by a newline character.**
