To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The objects involved are `_` and the return value of `func_10()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and the return value of `func_10()` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 2

The state of the output of `func_14()` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

State: **The output of `func_14()` is printed to the console as a string followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 2, and `_` is 2**
