Output State: **The output of `func_14()` is printed to the console as a string followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 2, and `_` is 2, and the output of `func_14()` is written to the console without buffering.**

In this output state, the code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` has executed, which means the output of `func_14()` has been converted to a string and written to the console followed by a newline character. The `sys.stdout.write()` function does not buffer its output, so the output is immediately written to the console. The values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
