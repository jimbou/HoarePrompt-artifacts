The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, lk and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `lk` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `lk-1`, `lk` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is at least `lk+2`. For the loop to execute again `i` is `lk` and for the loop to execute again `l` must be at least `lk+1`. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and is at least `lk+1`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), 2^lk, `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `lk`.**
