#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, considering the ranks of its associated values. If the key has only one associated value, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum rank by iterating over the associated values, updating the `processing` list and `rank` list accordingly, and returns the minimum rank plus 1.

The value of x - a // b * y is calculated using the values of x, a, b, and y.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, where b is less than a, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function (func_13) with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.
