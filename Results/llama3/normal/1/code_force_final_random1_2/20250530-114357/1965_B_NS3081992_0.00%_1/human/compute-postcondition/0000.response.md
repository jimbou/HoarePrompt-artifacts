To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the function `func_10()`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0, the loop can execute. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, its value is irrelevant.

State: **`func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
