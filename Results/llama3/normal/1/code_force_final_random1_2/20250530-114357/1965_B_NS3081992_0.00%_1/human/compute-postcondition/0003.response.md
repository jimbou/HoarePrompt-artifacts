The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the output of `func_14()` to the console as a string followed by a newline character. This means that the output of `func_14()` is converted to a string and then printed to the console.

Output State: **The output of `func_14()` is printed to the console as a string followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 1, and `_` is 1.**

In this output state, the output of `func_14()` is printed to the console, but its value is not stored in any variable. The values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged.
