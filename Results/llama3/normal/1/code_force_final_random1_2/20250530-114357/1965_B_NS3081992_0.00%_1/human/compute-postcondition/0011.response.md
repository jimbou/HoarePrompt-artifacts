To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(lk - 1):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `lk`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `lk`. If `i` is less than `lk - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `lk` is greater than 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `lk` is not changed by the loop, its value remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `lk` must be greater than 3.

The other variables `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `ans` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values 2^0 and 2^1, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
