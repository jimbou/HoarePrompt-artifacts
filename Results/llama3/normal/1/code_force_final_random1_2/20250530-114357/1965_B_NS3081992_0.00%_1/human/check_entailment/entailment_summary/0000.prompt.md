Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

 Output hints for function8:  The function generates a list of 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the result of the function func_7(), and returns this list. The function does not modify any input variables, and its sole purpose is to create and return a list of a specified length, with each element being the result of func_7().
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  Reads a string from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations, allowing the user to input a string that is then passed back to the caller.

''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, considering the ranks of its associated values. If the key has only one associated value, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum rank by iterating over the associated values, updating the `processing` list and `rank` list accordingly, and returns the minimum rank plus 1.
Function number 13 :

Otherwise, the function returns a string of space-separated powers of 2, including k-1-sum(ans), k+1, and 2*k+1, where ans is a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) and lk is the number of digits in the binary representation of k.
