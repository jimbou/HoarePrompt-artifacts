Output State: **The program returns a string of space-separated powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n, which is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), and k is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive). If k equals 1, then n is an integer between 3 and 10^6 (inclusive).**
