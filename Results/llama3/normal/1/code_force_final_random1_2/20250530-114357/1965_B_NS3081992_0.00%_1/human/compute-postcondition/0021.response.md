Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and is at least `l`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(l-2), 2^(l-1), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `l-1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `ans` now contains all powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the number of digits in the binary representation of `n`. The variable `i` has reached its final value of `l-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The other variables remain unchanged.
