Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. If k equals 1, then n and k are integers such that 3 <= n <= 10^6 and k equals 1. Otherwise, the list `ans` contains all the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the number of digits in the binary representation of `n`, and `i` is updated to `l-1`.***
