This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, considering the ranks of its associated values. If the key has only one associated value, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum rank by iterating over the associated values, updating the `processing` list and `rank` list accordingly, and returns the minimum rank plus 1.
