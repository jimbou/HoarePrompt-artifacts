Output State: **`func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the output of `func_14()` is printed to the console as a string followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged. The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` only affects the output to the console, printing the result of `func_14()` as a string followed by a newline character. The value of `func_14()` is not stored in any variable, so it is not included in the output state.
