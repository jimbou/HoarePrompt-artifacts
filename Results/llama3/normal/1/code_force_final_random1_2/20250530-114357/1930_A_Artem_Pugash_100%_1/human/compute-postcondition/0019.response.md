Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `2 * n`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is the sum of all elements at even indices of `l`, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the value of `i` is now equal to twice the value of `n`, the list `l` remains sorted, the `score` is now the sum of all elements at even indices of `l`, and the other variables `_` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
