Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `i` is 2 * `n`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first one, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains -2 inputs.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `i` will be twice the value of `n`, and the value of `score` will be the sum of every other element of the list `l`, starting from the first element. The list `l` remains sorted, and the other variables `_` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
