The code prints the value of `score`, which is the sum of every other element of the list `l`, starting from the first element.

Since `l` is a sorted list of integers, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `score` without knowing the specific elements in the list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of every other element of the list `l`, starting from the first element.

Output: **the sum of every other element of the list l, starting from the first element**
