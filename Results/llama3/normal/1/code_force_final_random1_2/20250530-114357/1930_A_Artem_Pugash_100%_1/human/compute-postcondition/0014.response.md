Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `score` has been updated to be equal to the first element of the sorted list `l`, since `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
