To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is 0, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
