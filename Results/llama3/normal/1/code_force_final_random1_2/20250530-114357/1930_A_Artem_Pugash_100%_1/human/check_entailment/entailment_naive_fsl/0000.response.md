Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers written on the whiteboard.
3. It sorts the integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It initializes a score variable `score` to 0.
5. It iterates over the sorted integers in steps of 2 (i.e., `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`), adding the smaller integer of each pair to the score.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program correctly implements the problem description by:

* Choosing two integers `x` and `y` that are written on the whiteboard.
* Adding the smaller integer `min(x, y)` to the score.
* Erasing `x` and `y` from the whiteboard.
* Repeating this process exactly `n` times.

The program handles all potential cases because:

* It correctly handles the case where `n` is 1, where only one move is made.
* It correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than 1, where multiple moves are made.
* It correctly handles the case where the integers on the whiteboard are all equal.
* It correctly handles the case where the integers on the whiteboard are all distinct.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases.
