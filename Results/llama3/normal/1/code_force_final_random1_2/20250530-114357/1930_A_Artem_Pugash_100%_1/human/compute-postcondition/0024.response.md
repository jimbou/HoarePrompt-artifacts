To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but we don't know its value. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1. We also need to define `i` as it is not defined before the loop starts. Since the loop starts from 0 and increments by 2, we can set `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is 0, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains -2 inputs**
