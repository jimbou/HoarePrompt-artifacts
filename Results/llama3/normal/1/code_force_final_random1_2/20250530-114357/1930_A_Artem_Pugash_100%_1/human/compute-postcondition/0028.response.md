The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step in the range is 2) and `n` must be greater than 1.5 (because `i` is 4 and `2 * n` must be greater than `i`).
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 4, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains -2 inputs.**
