To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 (since the step size is 2), and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since the loop condition is `2 * n`).

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2, and `n` should still be at least 1.

The other variables (`l`, `score`, `_`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains -2 inputs**
