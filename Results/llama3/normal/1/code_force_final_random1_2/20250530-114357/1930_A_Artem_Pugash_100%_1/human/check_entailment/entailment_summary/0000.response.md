Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and then reads `2n` integers.
3.  It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4.  It initializes a variable `score` to 0.
5.  It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`), adding the current integer to the `score`. This effectively adds the smaller of each pair of integers to the score.
6.  Finally, it prints the total score.

This approach is correct because it ensures that the smaller of each pair of integers is added to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the final score.

Correctness: **True**
