Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `2 * n`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l`, starting from the first element, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `l`, `_`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n`, which is the last value it takes after the loop finishes. The `score` will be the sum of every other element of `l`, starting from the first element, because the loop adds every other element of `l` to `score` in each iteration.
