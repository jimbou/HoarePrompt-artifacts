The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the return value of `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `int(input())`. If the return value of `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to the return value of `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) that must be greater than 0, _ is 0**
