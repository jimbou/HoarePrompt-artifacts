Output State: **`n` is 0, `i` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `score` is 0, `_` is `t`, `stdin` is empty, and the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first one which is `score` is being printed.**

This output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `n` has been reset to 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The variable `i` has also been reset to 0, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the list `l`. The list `l` is now empty, as all the test cases have been processed. The variable `score` has been reset to 0, indicating that there are no more scores to calculate. The variable `_` has been set to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, as all the input has been processed. Finally, the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first one, which is `score`, is being printed, indicating that the loop has finished executing and the final result is being output.
