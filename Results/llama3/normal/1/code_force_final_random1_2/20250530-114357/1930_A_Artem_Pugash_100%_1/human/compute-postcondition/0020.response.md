The code prints the value of `score` which is the sum of all elements at even indices of the list `l`. Since the exact list `l` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `score`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of all elements at even indices of the list `l`.

Output: **sum of all elements at even indices of the list l**
