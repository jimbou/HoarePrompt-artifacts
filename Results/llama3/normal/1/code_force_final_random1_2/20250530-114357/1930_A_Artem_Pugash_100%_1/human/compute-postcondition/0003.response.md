The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Since `i` is 0, the value of `score` is incremented by the first element of the list `l`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
