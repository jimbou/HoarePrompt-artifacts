To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of numbers starting from 0, up to `2 * n`, with a step size of 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. To determine the next value of `i`, we need to add the step size (2) to the current value of `i`. Therefore, the next value of `i` is 2.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`l`, `score`, `_`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
