Output State: **n is an integer, i is not defined, l is a sorted list of integers, score is 0, _ is not defined, stdin contains -2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer, but its exact value is unknown because it was reassigned from the input. The variable `i` is no longer defined because it was not reassigned after `n` was updated. The list `l` is a sorted list of integers, but its exact elements are unknown because they were read from the input. The variable `score` is 0 because it was explicitly set to 0. The variable `_` is still not defined because it was not assigned a value. Stdin now contains -2 inputs because two inputs were read: one for `n` and one for `l`.
