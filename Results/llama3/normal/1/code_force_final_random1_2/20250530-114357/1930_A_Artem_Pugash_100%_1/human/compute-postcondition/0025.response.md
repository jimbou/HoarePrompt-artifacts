The code `score += l[i]` adds the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l` to the variable `score`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of the list `l` is added to `score`. The list `l` is sorted, but we don't know the exact values, so we can't determine the exact value of `score` after the addition. However, we can say that `score` is now equal to the sum of its previous value (0) and the first element of the list `l`.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains -2 inputs**
