To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 (since the step size is 2), and `n` must be such that `2 * n` is greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2 (since `2 * n` must be greater than 2).

The other variables (`l`, `score`, `_`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
