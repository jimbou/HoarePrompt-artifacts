Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers themselves.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It initializes a variable `score` to 0, which will store the maximum final score.
5. It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, starting from the first element (index 0). For each pair of elements, it adds the smaller element (which is the first element of the pair due to the sorting) to the `score`.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum final score, which is the sum of the smaller elements of each pair.

The program's logic is correct because:

* By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the score.
* By iterating over the list in steps of 2, we ensure that we consider each pair of elements exactly once.
* By adding the smaller element of each pair to the score, we maximize the score.

The program's implementation is also correct, with no syntax errors or logical flaws.

Correctness: **True**
