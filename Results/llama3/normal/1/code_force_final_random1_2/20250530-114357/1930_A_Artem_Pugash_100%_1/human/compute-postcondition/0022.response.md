To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the `range` object created by `int(input())`.
2. The `range` object is created by reading an integer from the input. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, the input has already been read, and the `range` object has been created.
3. The `_` variable is not used anywhere in the loop body, so its value is not important.
4. For the loop to execute again, the `range` object must have at least one more iteration left. This means that the integer read from the input must be greater than the current iteration number.

Now, let's adjust the states:

* `_` is not defined (no change)
* `stdin` contains 0 inputs (since the input has already been read)
* The other variables (`n`, `i`, `l`, `score`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `2 * n`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is the sum of all elements at even indices of `l`, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**
