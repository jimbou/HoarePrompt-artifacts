To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of numbers starting from 0, up to `2 * n`, with a step size of 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. To determine the next value of `i`, we need to add the step size (2) to the current value of `i`. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 4.

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `2 * n`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `2 * n` will be greater than 4. Therefore, the loop will execute again.

The other variables in the state (`l`, `score`, `_`, and `stdin`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 4, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
