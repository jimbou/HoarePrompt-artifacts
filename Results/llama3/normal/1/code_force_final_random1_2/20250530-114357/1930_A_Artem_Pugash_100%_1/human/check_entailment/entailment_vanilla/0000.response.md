Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on a set of 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The goal is to maximize the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of integers chosen in each move.

2. The given program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of integers (n) and the list of integers.

3. The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to efficiently find the pairs of integers that will result in the maximum score.

4. The program then initializes a variable 'score' to 0, which will be used to keep track of the maximum score.

5. The program uses a for loop to iterate over the sorted list of integers in steps of 2 (i.e., it considers pairs of integers). For each pair, it adds the smaller integer (l[i]) to the score. This is because the minimum value of the pair is added to the score in each move.

6. After iterating over all pairs of integers, the program prints the maximum score.

7. The program repeats this process for each test case.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on a set of 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard.

Correctness: **True**
