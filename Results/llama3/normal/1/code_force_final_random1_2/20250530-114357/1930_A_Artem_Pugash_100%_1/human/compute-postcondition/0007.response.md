The value of `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, where `i` is 4. The value of `l[i]` is the fifth element of the sorted list `l`, since list indices in Python start at 0. The value of `score` was initially equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`. Therefore, the new value of `score` is the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 4, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
