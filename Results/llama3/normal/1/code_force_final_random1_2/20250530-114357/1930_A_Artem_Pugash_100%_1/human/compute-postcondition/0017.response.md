According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `2 * n` must be greater than 4. Since `n` is at least 2, `2 * n` is at least 4, so `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of the first two elements of `l`, `_` is not defined, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
