The code `score += l[i]` adds the value of the element at index `i` in list `l` to the current value of `score`. Since `i` is 2, we are adding the third element of the sorted list `l` to `score`. The initial value of `score` is the first element of `l`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
