This function, `recursive_maximize_sum`, takes a list of non-negative integers `a` and two non-negative integers `l` and `r` as input, where `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. It modifies the list `a` by either setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` if the sum of elements in this range is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1)^2`, or recursively maximizing the sum for the sublists `a[l:pos - 1]` and `a[pos + 1:r + 1]` if the sum is greater. The function also keeps track of the operations performed by appending a tuple of `(l, r)` to the list `ops`. The final state of the program is that the list `a` has been modified to maximize the sum of its elements in the range from `l` to `r`, and the list `ops` contains a record of the operations performed.
