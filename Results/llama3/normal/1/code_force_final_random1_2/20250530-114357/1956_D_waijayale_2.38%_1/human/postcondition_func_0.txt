This function modifies a list of non-negative integers `a` and a list of tuples `ops` based on the input parameters `l` and `r`. If `l` is equal to `r`, it checks if the element at index `l` in `a` is not equal to 0, and if so, appends a tuple `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets the element at index `l` in `a` to 0. If `l` is not equal to `r`, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, and then checks if the element at index `l` in `a` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If this condition is true, it appends a tuple `(l, r)` to `ops` and sets all elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` to `r - l + 1`, and then recursively calls itself again with `l + 1` and `r`. The function does not return any value.
