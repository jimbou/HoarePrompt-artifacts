Postcondition: **l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the elements in a from index l to r (inclusive), mx is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1], and the function has recursively maximized the sum for the sublists a[l:pos - 1] and a[pos + 1:r + 1] if pos is not equal to r, otherwise no further recursive calls are made.**
