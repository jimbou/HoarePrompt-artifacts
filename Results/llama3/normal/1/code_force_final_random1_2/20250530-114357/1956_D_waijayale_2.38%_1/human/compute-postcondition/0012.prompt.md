Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the elements in a, m is the maximum element in a, ops is the number of operations performed by func_2 on a, stdin is empty, and the sum of the elements in the list a which is s and the maximum element in the list a which is m are being printed
Code of the loop:
for l, r in ops:
    print(l + 1, r + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a list of pairs of elements that must have at least one pair, `stdin` is empty, `l` is the first element of the first pair in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the first pair in `ops`, and the value of `l + 1` and `r + 1` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a list of pairs of elements that must have at least 2 pairs, `stdin` is empty, `l` is the first element of the second pair in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the second pair in `ops`, and the first element of the second pair in `ops` incremented by 1 which is `l + 1` and the second element of the second pair in `ops` incremented by 1 which is `r + 1` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a list of pairs of elements that must have at least 3 pairs, `stdin` is empty, `l` is the first element of the third pair in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the third pair in `ops`, and this is printed: the value of `l` incremented by 1 and the value of `r` incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
