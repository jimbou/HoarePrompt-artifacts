Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `s` is the sum of the elements in list `a`. Since `a` is a list of non-negative integers, the sum `s` will be a non-negative integer as well.
* `m` is the maximum element in list `a`. Since `a` is a list of non-negative integers, the maximum element `m` will be a non-negative integer as well.

When the `print(s, m)` statement is executed, it will print the values of `s` and `m` separated by a space.

Output: **s (the sum of the elements in list a), m (the maximum element in list a)**

Note that we cannot provide an exact numerical value for `s` and `m` since the specific values of the elements in list `a` are not provided. However, we can describe their values based on the precondition.
