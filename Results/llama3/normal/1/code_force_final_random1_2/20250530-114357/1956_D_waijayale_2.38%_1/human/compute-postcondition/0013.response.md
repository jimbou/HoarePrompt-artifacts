Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, expecting a positive integer followed by a space-separated list of non-negative integers. It calculates the sum and maximum element of the list, and performs some operation (not specified in the provided code snippet) that results in a list of pairs of elements. The function then prints the sum, maximum element, and the pairs of elements (with indices incremented by 1).**
