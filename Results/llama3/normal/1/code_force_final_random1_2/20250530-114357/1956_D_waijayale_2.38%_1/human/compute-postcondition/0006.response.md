The only objects in the loop head are variables  `l`, `r` and list `ops`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ops.  If the list has at least 2 pairs the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, ops has at least 1 pair, l is the first element of the first pair in ops, r is the second element of the first pair in ops, and the value of `l + 1` and `r + 1` are being printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 pairs and the l is the first element of the second pair in ops and r is the second element of the second pair in ops.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a list of pairs of elements that must have at least 2 pairs, `stdin` is empty, `l` is the first element of the second pair in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the second pair in `ops`**
