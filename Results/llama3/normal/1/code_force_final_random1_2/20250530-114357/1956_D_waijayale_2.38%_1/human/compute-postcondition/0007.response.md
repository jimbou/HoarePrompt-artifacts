The code prints the value of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` is the first element of the second pair in the `ops` list and `r` is the second element of the second pair in the `ops` list.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the incremented values of `l` and `r`.

Output: **l + 1 (where l is the first element of the second pair in the ops list) and r + 1 (where r is the second element of the second pair in the ops list)**
