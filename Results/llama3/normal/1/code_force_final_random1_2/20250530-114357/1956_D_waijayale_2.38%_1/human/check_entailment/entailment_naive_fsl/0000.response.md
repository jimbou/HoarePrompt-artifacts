Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function, which does not correctly handle the case when the maximum value in the subarray is not at the beginning or end of the subarray.

For example, consider the input `[1, 3, 9, 1]`. The program will first find the maximum value `9` and try to maximize the sum of the subarray `[1, 3, 9]`. However, it will not consider the possibility of maximizing the sum of the subarray `[9, 1]`, which would result in a larger sum.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible subarrays, not just those that start or end with the maximum value. One possible solution is to use a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum sum of all possible subarrays.

Note that the program may work correctly for some inputs, but it is not correct in general. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
