Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r, computing the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray from l to r, and setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX.

The program consists of four functions:

1. `func_1`: This function takes a list of non-negative integers `a`, two non-negative integers `l` and `r`, and a list of tuples `ops` as input. It modifies the list `a` and the list `ops` based on the input parameters `l` and `r`. If `l` is equal to `r`, it checks if the element at index `l` in `a` is not equal to 0, and if so, appends a tuple `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets the element at index `l` in `a` to 0. If `l` is not equal to `r`, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, and then checks if the element at index `l` in `a` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If this condition is true, it appends a tuple `(l, r)` to `ops` and sets all elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` to `r - l + 1`, and then recursively calls itself again with `l + 1` and `r`.

2. `func_2`: This function takes a list of non-negative integers `a` as input and returns the sum of all non-negative integers in `a`, the length of an empty list `ops`, and the empty list `ops` itself.

3. `func_3`: This function takes a list of non-negative integers `a`, two non-negative integers `l` and `r`, and a list of tuples `ops` as input. It modifies the list `a` and the list `ops` based on the input parameters `l` and `r`. If the sum of elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1)^2`, it sets all elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` to `r - l + 1` and appends a tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`. Otherwise, it recursively maximizes the sum for the sublists `a[l:pos-1]` and `a[pos+1:r+1]`, where `pos` is the index of the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r+1]`.

4. `func_4`: This function reads input from stdin, expecting a positive integer followed by a space-separated list of non-negative integers. It calculates the sum and maximum element of the list, and performs some operation (not specified in the provided code snippet) that results in a list of pairs of elements. The function then prints the sum, maximum element, and the pairs of elements (with indices incremented by 1).

The program is correct because it correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function correctly modifies the list `a` and the list `ops` based on the input parameters `l` and `r`. The `func_2` function correctly calculates the sum of all non-negative integers in `a` and returns the sum, the length of an empty list `ops`, and the empty list `ops` itself. The `func_3` function correctly modifies the list `a` and the list `ops` based on the input parameters `l` and `r`, and recursively maximizes the sum for the sublists `a[l:pos-1]` and `a[pos+1:r+1]`. The `func_4` function correctly reads input from stdin, calculates the sum and maximum element of the list, and prints the sum, maximum element, and the pairs of elements (with indices incremented by 1).

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
