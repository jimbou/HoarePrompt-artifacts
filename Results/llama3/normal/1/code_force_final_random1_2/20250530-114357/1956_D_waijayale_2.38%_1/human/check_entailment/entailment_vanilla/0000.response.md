Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `recursive_maximize_sum`, and `func_3`. 

`func_1` is a recursive function that takes an array `a`, two indices `l` and `r`, and a list of operations `ops` as input. It checks if `l` is equal to `r`. If `l` is equal to `r` and `a[l]` is not equal to 0, it appends `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets `a[l]` to 0. Then, it calls itself with `l + 1` and `r` as the new indices. If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it appends `(l, r)` to `ops`, sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`, and calls itself with `l + 1` and `r` as the new indices.

`func_2` takes an array `a` as input and initializes an empty list `ops`. It calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with 0 and `n - 1` as the initial indices, where `n` is the length of the array. Then, it returns a tuple containing the sum of the elements in the array, the length of `ops`, and `ops` itself.

`recursive_maximize_sum` is a recursive function that takes two indices `l` and `r` as input. It calculates the sum of the elements in the range `[l, r]` and checks if it is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If it is, it calls `func_1` with `l`, `r`, and `ops` as input, appends `(l, r)` to `ops`, and sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`. If the sum is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it finds the maximum element in the range `[l, r]` and its position. If the position is not equal to `l`, it calls itself with `l` and `pos - 1` as the new indices. If the position is not equal to `r`, it calls itself with `pos + 1` and `r` as the new indices.

`func_3` reads the input, calls `func_2` with the input array, and prints the result.

The program seems to be correct as it follows the problem description and the given examples. It correctly implements the operation and the recursive approach to maximize the sum of the elements in the array.

Correctness: **True**
