Postcondition: **l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the elements in a from index l to r (inclusive), mx is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1], and the current value of pos is the index of mx in the original list a. If pos is not equal to l, the function recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1) has been called and returned.**
