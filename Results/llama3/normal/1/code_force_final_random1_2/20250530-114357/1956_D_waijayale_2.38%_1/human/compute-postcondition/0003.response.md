To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `l`, `r`, and `ops`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` list. If `ops` has at least one pair of elements `(l, r)`, the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a list of pairs of elements that must have at least one pair, `stdin` is empty, `l` is the first element of the first pair in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the first pair in `ops`**
