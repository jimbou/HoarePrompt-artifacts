Correctness: **False**

Reasoning: 

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in function `func_2`, which is supposed to calculate the maximum sum of the array elements and return the sum along with the operations needed to achieve this sum. However, the function does not perform any operations or modifications to the input list `a`. It simply calculates the sum of the elements in `a` and returns the sum along with an empty list `ops` and its length, which is 0.

To correctly solve the problem, function `func_2` should call `recursive_maximize_sum` (function `func_3`) to modify the input list `a` and calculate the maximum sum. The `recursive_maximize_sum` function should be modified to keep track of the operations performed and return the modified list `a` and the list of operations `ops`.

Additionally, function `func_1` seems to be incorrectly implemented. It is supposed to modify the list `a` and the list of operations `ops` based on the input parameters `l` and `r`. However, the function does not correctly handle the case when `l` is not equal to `r`. It recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, but it does not correctly update the list `a` and the list of operations `ops`.

Overall, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem, and significant modifications are needed to make it work correctly.
