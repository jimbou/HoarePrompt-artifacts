Output State: **l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the elements in a from index l to r (inclusive), mx is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1], pos is the index of mx in the original list a, and the function recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r) has been called and returned, and the function recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1) has been called and returned.**

In this output state, the function recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r) has been called and returned, which means that the function has finished its execution and returned a value. The values of the other variables are not affected by this function call. The function recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1) has also been called and returned, which is a precondition for the current state.
