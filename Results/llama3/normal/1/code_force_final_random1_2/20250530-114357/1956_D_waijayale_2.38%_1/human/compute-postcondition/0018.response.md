Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, and `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1)^2`, all elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) are equal to `r - l + 1`, `s` is equal to `(r - l + 1)^2`, `ops` is a list containing a tuple of `(l, r)`, and `i` is `r`. Otherwise, the function has recursively maximized the sum for the sublists `a[l:pos - 1]` and `a[pos + 1:r + 1]` if `pos` is not equal to `r`, or no further recursive calls are made if `pos` is equal to `r`, and `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`.***
