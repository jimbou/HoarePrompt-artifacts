The only objects in the loop head are variables  l, r and list  ops, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ops.  If the list has at least 3 pairs the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, ops has at least 2 pairs, l is the first element of the second pair in ops, r is the second element of the second pair in ops. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 pairs and the l is the first element of the third pair in ops and r is the second element of the third pair in ops.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a list of pairs of elements that must have at least 3 pairs, `stdin` is empty, `l` is the first element of the third pair in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the third pair in `ops`**
