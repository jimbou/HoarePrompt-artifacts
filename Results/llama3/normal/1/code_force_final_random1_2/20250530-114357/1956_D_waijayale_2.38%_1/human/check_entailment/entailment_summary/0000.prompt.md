Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:

Function number 1 :
 Code:

def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:

        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function modifies a list of non-negative integers `a` and a list of tuples `ops` based on the input parameters `l` and `r`. If `l` is equal to `r`, it checks if the element at index `l` in `a` is not equal to 0, and if so, appends a tuple `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets the element at index `l` in `a` to 0. If `l` is not equal to `r`, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, and then checks if the element at index `l` in `a` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If this condition is true, it appends a tuple `(l, r)` to `ops` and sets all elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` to `r - l + 1`, and then recursively calls itself again with `l + 1` and `r`. The function does not return any value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function calculates the sum of all non-negative integers in a given list 'a' and returns the sum along with an empty list 'ops' and its length, which is 0. The function does not modify the input list 'a' or perform any operations that affect external state. It solely computes and returns the sum of non-negative integers in 'a' and an empty list 'ops' with its length.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  This function, `recursive_maximize_sum`, takes a list of non-negative integers `a` and two non-negative integers `l` and `r` as input, where `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. It modifies the list `a` by either setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` if the sum of elements in this range is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1)^2`, or recursively maximizing the sum for the sublists `a[l:pos - 1]` and `a[pos + 1:r + 1]` if the sum is greater. The function also keeps track of the operations performed by appending a tuple of `(l, r)` to the list `ops`. The final state of the program is that the list `a` has been modified to maximize the sum of its elements in the range from `l` to `r`, and the list `ops` contains a record of the operations performed.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function reads input from stdin, expecting a positive integer followed by a space-separated list of non-negative integers. It calculates the sum and maximum element of the list, and performs some operation (not specified in the provided code snippet) that results in a list of pairs of elements. The function then prints the sum, maximum element, and the pairs of elements (with indices incremented by 1).
