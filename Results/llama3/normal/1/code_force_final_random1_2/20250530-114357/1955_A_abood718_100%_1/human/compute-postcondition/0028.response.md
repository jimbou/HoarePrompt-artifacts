Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables involved in the print statement.

The print statement is `print(A * B)`. We are given that `A` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `B` is an integer between 1 and 30.

Since we don't have explicit values for `A` and `B`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `A * B`. However, we can describe the value of the expression using the given information.

The value of `A * B` is the product of an integer between 1 and 100 (`A`) and an integer between 1 and 30 (`B`). This means the result will be an integer between 1 and 3000 (since 100 * 30 = 3000).

Therefore, the print statement will output the product of `A` and `B`, which is an integer between 1 and 3000.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 3000 (which is the product of A and B)**
