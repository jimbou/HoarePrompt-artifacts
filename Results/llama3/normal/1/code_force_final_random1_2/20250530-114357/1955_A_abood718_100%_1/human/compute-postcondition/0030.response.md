The code prints the result of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`. 

In this expression, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `C` is an integer between 1 and 30.

The expression `A * C` will result in a value between 1 and 3000 (since 100 * 30 = 3000).

The expression `A * C / 2` will result in a value between 0.5 and 1500 (since 3000 / 2 = 1500).

The `int()` function will truncate the decimal part of the result, so the final output will be an integer between 0 and 1500.

Output: **an integer between 0 and 1500 (inclusive)**
