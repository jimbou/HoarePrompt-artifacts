The code prints the result of the expression `X * C + B`. 

`X` is an integer between 0 and 50, `C` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `B` is an integer between 1 and 30.

Since the exact values of `X`, `C`, and `B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `X * C + B`.

Output: **X * C + B (where X is an integer between 0 and 50, C is an integer between 1 and 30, and B is an integer between 1 and 30)**
