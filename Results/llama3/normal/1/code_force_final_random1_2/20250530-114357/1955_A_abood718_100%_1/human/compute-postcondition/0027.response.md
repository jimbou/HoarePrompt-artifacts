Output State: **`i` is 2, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100, `B` and `C` are integers between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `t` is greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from the input, which contains three integers A, B, and C. These values are assigned to the variables A, B, and C, respectively. The values of i, t, and the remaining input lines are not affected. The only change is that the first line of the input is consumed, leaving t-3 lines remaining.
