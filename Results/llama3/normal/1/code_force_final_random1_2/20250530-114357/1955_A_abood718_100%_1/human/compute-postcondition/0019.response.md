The code prints the result of the expression `A * C / 2`, which is an integer value.

Since `A` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `C` is an integer between 1 and 30, the product `A * C` will be an integer between 1 and 3000.

The division by 2 will result in an integer value, since the product `A * C` is even (as both `A` and `C` are integers).

Therefore, the output will be an integer value between 0 and 1500.

Output: **an integer between 0 and 1500 (inclusive)**
