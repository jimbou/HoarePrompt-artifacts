Output State: **`i` is 0, `A` is an odd integer between 1 and 100, `B` and `C` are integers between 1 and 30 where `B` is less than or equal to `C` divided by 2, `X` is an integer between 0 and 49, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

In this output state, the value of `X` is calculated as the integer division of `A` by 2, which results in an integer between 0 and 49 since `A` is an odd integer between 1 and 100. The values of `i`, `B`, `C`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
