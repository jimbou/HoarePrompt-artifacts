Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers where `A` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100, `B` and `C` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 30, and the current value of `B` is less than half of the current value of `C`. stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**
