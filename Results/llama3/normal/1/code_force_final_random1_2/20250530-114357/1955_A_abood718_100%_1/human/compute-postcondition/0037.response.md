Output State: **`i` is `t`, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers where `A` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100, `B` and `C` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 30, stdin is empty. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B` is greater than or equal to half of `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer part of half of the product of `A` and `C` is printed. If `A` is odd, an integer `X` between 0 and 49 is used to calculate and print the value of `X` * `C` + `B`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` will still be integers within their respective ranges. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, as all the test cases would have been processed. The output will depend on the values of `B` and `C`, and the parity of `A`. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` will be printed. If `B` is greater than or equal to half of `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer part of half of the product of `A` and `C` will be printed. If `A` is odd, an integer `X` between 0 and 49 will be used to calculate and print the value of `X` * `C` + `B`.
