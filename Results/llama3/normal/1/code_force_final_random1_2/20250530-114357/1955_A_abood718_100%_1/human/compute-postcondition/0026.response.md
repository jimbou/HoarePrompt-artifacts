The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 2, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100, `B` and `C` are integers between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `t` is greater than 2. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the value of the expression `X` * `C` + `B` is printed, where `X` is an integer between 0 and 50.**
