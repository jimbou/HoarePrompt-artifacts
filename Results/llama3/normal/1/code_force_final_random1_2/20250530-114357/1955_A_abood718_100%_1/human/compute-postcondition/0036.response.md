Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100, `B` and `C` are integers between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `t` is greater than 2. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, an integer `X` between 0 and 50 is used to print `X * C + B`.***
