Output: **`i` is 0, `A` is an odd integer between 1 and 100, `B` and `C` are integers between 1 and 30 where `B` is less than or equal to `C` divided by 2, `X` is an integer between 0 and 49, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and this is printed: X * C + B, where X is an integer between 0 and 49, C is an integer between 1 and 30, and B is an integer between 1 and 30 and less than or equal to C divided by 2**
