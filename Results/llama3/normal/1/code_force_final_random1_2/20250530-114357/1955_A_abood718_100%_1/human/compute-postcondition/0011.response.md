The code prints the result of the expression `X * C + B`. Let's break down the values of the variables involved:

* `X` is an integer between 0 and 49.
* `C` is an integer between 1 and 30.
* `B` is an integer between 1 and 30, and is less than or equal to `C` divided by 2.

Since the exact values of `X`, `C`, and `B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, we can describe the output as:

Output: **a value between 0 and 1470 (inclusive), which is the result of multiplying X (an integer between 0 and 49) by C (an integer between 1 and 30) and adding B (an integer between 1 and 30, where B is less than or equal to C divided by 2)**
