To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input value, which is not explicitly named but is used to determine the range of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and the input value is `t`, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the input value `t`. Since `i` is 0, the input value `t` must be greater than 0.

The other variables `A`, `B`, `C`, and `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers where `A` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100, `B` and `C` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 30, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `t` is greater than 1**
