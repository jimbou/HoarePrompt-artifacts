Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (A), the price for one yogurt (B), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (C).
3. The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2*B) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (C). If so, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the regular price (A*B).
4. If buying two yogurts at the regular price is not cheaper, the program checks if the number of yogurts is even (A % 2 == 0). If it is, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the promotion price and dividing by 2 (A * C / 2).
5. If the number of yogurts is odd, the program calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (A // 2), multiplies this number by the promotion price (X * C), and adds the price of one yogurt at the regular price (B) to get the total cost.

Correctness: **True**
