Output: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers where `A` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100, and the current value of `A` is even, `B` and `C` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 30, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). `B` is less than or equal to `C` divided by 2, and the integer part of half of the product of `A` and `C` is being printed**
