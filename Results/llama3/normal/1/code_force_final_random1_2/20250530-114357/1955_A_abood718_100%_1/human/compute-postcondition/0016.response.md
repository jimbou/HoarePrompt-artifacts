Output State: **`i` is 1, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100, `B` and `C` are integers between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `t` is greater than 1**

In this output state, the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` have been updated to the integers read from the input, which are within the specified ranges. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each with three integers, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `t` is still greater than 1.
