Output State: **`i` is 1, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100, `B` and `C` are integers between 1 and 30, `X` is an integer between 0 and 50, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `t` is greater than 1**

In this output state, the value of `X` is calculated as the integer division of `A` by 2, which results in an integer between 0 and 50. The values of `i`, `B`, `C`, `t`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
