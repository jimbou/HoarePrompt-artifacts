Output: **`i` is 2, `A` is an integer between 1 and 100, `B` and `C` are integers between 1 and 30, `X` is an integer between 0 and 50, `t` is greater than 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and this is printed: X * C + B, where X is an integer between 0 and 50, C is an integer between 1 and 30, and B is an integer between 1 and 30**
