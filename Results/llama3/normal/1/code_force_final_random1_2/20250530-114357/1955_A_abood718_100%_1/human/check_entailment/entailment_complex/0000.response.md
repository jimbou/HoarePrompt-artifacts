Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts based on the promotion.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If the price of one yogurt (B) is less than half of the promotion price (C), it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. In this case, the program prints the product of the number of yogurts (A) and the price of one yogurt (B).

2. If the price of one yogurt (B) is greater than or equal to half of the promotion price (C), it's cheaper to buy yogurts in pairs using the promotion. In this case, the program checks if the number of yogurts (A) is even.

   - If A is even, the program prints the integer part of half of the product of A and C, which is the minimum cost of buying A yogurts in pairs using the promotion.

   - If A is odd, the program calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought using the promotion (X = A // 2), and then adds the cost of buying the remaining yogurt individually (B). This is because buying the remaining yogurt individually is cheaper than buying it as part of a pair using the promotion.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the minimum cost of buying n yogurts based on the promotion.

Correctness: **True**
