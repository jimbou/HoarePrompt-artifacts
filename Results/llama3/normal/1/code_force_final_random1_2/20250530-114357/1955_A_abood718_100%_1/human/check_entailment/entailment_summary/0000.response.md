Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program first checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * B) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (C). If it is, the program prints the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (A * B).

If buying two yogurts at the regular price is not cheaper, the program checks if the number of yogurts (A) is even. If it is, the program prints the cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price (A * C / 2).

If the number of yogurts is odd, the program calculates the cost of buying the maximum number of pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (X * C, where X is the integer part of A divided by 2), and adds the cost of buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price (B).

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the minimum cost of buying the required number of yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
