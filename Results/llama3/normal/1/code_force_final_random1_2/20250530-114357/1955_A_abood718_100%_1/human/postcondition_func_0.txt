This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers A, B, and C. It then prints a calculated value for each test case based on the following rules: if B is less than half of C, it prints the product of A and B; if B is greater than or equal to half of C, it prints the integer part of half of the product of A and C if A is even, or the value of X * C + B if A is odd, where X is the integer part of A divided by 2. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, at which point the input is empty.
