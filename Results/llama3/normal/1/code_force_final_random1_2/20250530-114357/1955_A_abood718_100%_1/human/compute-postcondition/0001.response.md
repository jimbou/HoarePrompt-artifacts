Output State: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers where `A` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100, `B` and `C` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 30, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. Since the input contains an integer `t` followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers, the first line is read and assigned to `A`, `B`, and `C`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers within the specified ranges.
