The code prints the integer value of the product of A and C divided by 2. Since A is an even integer between 1 and 100, and C is an integer between 1 and 30, the product A * C will be an even integer between 1 and 3000. Dividing this product by 2 will result in an integer value between 0.5 and 1500. However, since the print statement uses the int() function, the result will be truncated to an integer, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number.

Output: **an integer between 0 and 1500 (inclusive), which is the integer value of the product of A and C divided by 2**
