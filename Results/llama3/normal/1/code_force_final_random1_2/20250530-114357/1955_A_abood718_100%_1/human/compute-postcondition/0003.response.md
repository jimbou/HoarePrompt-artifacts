The code prints the product of A and B. Where A is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100, and B is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 30, and the current value of B is less than half of the current value of C.
Output: **A*B (where A is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and B is an integer between 1 and 15 inclusive)**
