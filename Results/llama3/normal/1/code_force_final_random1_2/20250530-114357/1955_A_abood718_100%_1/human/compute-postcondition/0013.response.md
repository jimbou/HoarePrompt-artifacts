Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, `C` are integers where `A` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100, `B` and `C` are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 30, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). `B` is less than or equal to `C` divided by 2. If `A` is even, the integer part of half of the product of `A` and `C` is being printed. If `A` is odd, an integer `X` between 0 and 49 is used to calculate and print the value of `X` * `C` + `B`.***
