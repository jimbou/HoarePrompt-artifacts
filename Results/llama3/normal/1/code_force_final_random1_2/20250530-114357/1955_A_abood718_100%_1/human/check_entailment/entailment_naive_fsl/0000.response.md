Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It first checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price. If it is, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the regular price. If not, it checks if the number of yogurts is even. If it is, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the promotion price and dividing by 2. If the number of yogurts is odd, it calculates the total cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when the number of yogurts is even or odd, and when the promotion price is cheaper or more expensive than buying two yogurts at the regular price. Therefore, the program is correct.
