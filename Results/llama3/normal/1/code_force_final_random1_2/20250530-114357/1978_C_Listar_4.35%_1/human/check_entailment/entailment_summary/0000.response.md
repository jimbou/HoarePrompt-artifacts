Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions are consistent with the expected behavior.

Function `func_2` correctly filters or validates the input values `n` and `k` based on the conditions specified in the problem description. It checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within a certain range based on `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum allowed value based on `n`, the function returns two zeros, indicating that no suitable permutation exists.

Function `func_1` correctly reorders a list of integers from 1 to `n` in a specific way based on the input `k`. It moves the last element to a position determined by `k` and reverses the remaining elements. This results in a list that satisfies the Manhattan value condition specified in the problem description.

Function `func_3` correctly prints the elements of the input list `l` and returns nothing.

Function `func_4` correctly calls `func_2` to obtain the validated input values `n` and `k`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without modifying the input values. If `n` is greater than 0, it calls `func_1` to obtain a suitable permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the permutation.

Overall, the program correctly determines if a suitable permutation exists for the given input values `n` and `k` and prints the permutation if it exists.
