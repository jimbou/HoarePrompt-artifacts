Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when `k` is odd. In the `func_2` function, it checks if `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)` immediately, which means it does not attempt to find a permutation for odd values of `k`. However, the problem statement does not restrict `k` to be even, and there may be permutations that satisfy the condition for odd values of `k`.

For example, when `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the program will output "NO" because `k` is odd, but a valid permutation is `[3, 1, 2]`, which has a Manhattan value of 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases, specifically odd values of `k`.
