Functionality: **This function takes two non-negative integers `n` and `k` as input, which are presumably obtained from a function `func_2()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without modifying the input values. If `n` is greater than 0, it calls another function `func_1(n, k)` to obtain a value `l`, and then calls a third function `func_3(l)` without returning any value. In both cases, the input values `n` and `k` remain unchanged.**
