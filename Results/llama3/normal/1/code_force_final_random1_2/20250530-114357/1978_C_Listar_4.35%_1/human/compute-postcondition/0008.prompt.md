You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that n is non-negative and k is non-negative, and they are the result of a function func_2() that presumably reads input from somewhere.
    n, k = func_2()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the program remains unchanged, with 'n' still being 0 and 'NO' still being printed. The values of 'n' and 'k' remain as non-negative integers, but their specific values are not affected by the empty return statement.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are non-negative integers, and they are the result of a function `func_2()` that presumably reads input from somewhere. `n` is larger than 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing, as there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n, k, and l remain unchanged, with n being a non-negative integer greater than 0, k being a non-negative integer, and l being the result of the function func_1(n, k).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the program remains unchanged, with 'n' still being 0 and 'NO' still being printed. The values of 'n' and 'k' remain as non-negative integers, but their specific values are not affected by the empty return statement.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n, k, and l remain unchanged, with n being a non-negative integer greater than 0, k being a non-negative integer, and l being the result of the function func_1(n, k).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
