Output State: **`n` and `k` are non-negative integers, and they are the result of a function `func_2()` that presumably reads input from somewhere.**

In this case, the code does not modify the values of `n` and `k` but rather assigns them the values returned by the function `func_2()`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are non-negative integers, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `n` and `k` are the result of the function `func_2()`.
