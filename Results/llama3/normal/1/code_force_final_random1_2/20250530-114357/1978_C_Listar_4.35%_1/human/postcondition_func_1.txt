This function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input, where `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and `k` is between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). It checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within a certain range based on `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum allowed value based on `n`, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original `n` and `k` values. The function effectively filters or validates the input values based on these conditions.
