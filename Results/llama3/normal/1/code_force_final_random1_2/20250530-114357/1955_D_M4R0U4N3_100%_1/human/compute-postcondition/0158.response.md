Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) except all `i` which are in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is the last integer in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `n-m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all unique integers in `b_values`, resetting the count of each integer in `cnt_b` to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
