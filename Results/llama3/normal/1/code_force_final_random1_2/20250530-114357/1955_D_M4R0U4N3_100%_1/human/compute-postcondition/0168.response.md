The code creates a set of unique values from list `b` and assigns it to `b_values`. It then initializes two variables, `ans` and `curr`, to 0.

Output State: **n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, i is m-1, cnt_b[b[0]] is incremented by 1, cnt_b[b[1]] is incremented by 1, cnt_b[b[2]] is incremented by 1, ..., cnt_b[b[m-1]] is incremented by 1, b_values is a set of unique values from list b, ans is 0, curr is 0**
