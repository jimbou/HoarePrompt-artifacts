The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, and `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `curr` is 2, otherwise `curr` is 1.**
