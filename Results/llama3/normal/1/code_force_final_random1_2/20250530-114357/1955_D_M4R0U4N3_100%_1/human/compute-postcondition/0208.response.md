Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `curr` is decreased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `curr` is decreased by 1.
