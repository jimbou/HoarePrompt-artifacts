To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(m):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `m` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`max_val`, `cnt_b`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `stdin`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[0]` is increased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1**
