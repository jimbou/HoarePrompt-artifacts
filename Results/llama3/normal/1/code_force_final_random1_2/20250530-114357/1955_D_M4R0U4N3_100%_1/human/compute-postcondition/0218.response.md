Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 1 or 2, `n` is greater than `m+1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1 and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[2]]` is also incremented by 1. The value of `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
