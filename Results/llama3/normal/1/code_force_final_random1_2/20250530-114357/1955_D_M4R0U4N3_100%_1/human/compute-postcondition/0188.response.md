Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `m`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 1. If all `a[i]` are in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0 for all `i`, then the current value of `curr` is `m`. Otherwise, the current value of `curr` is less than `m` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1 for some `i`. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `curr` and `cnt_b` are still valid, and the value of `curr` is still greater than or equal to `k`.
