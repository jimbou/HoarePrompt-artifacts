Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 1 or 2, `n` is greater than `m+1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1 and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, all the variables and conditions from the initial state are still valid, except that `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` has been decremented by 1. This means that the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` has been reduced by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
