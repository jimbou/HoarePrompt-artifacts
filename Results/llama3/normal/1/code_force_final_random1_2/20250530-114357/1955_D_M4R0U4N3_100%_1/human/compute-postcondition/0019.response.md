Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in the set of unique integers from list `b` (`b_values`), `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is 0, and the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` has been decreased by 1, but only if `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in the set of unique integers from list `b` (`b_values`).
