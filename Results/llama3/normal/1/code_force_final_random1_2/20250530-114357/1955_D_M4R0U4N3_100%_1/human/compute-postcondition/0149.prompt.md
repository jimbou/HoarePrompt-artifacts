Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is `m-1`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `n-m` is greater than 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i+m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` minus 1 if `a[i+m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i+m]]` is greater than 0. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `n-m` is greater than 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i+m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` minus 1 if `a[i+m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i+m]]` is greater than 0. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and `curr` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then the value of `curr` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `curr` remains unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and `curr` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then the value of `curr` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `curr` remains unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and `curr` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `curr` remains unchanged.

Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
