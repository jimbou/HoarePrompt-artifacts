The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n-m`. If `i` is less than `n-m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n-m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n-m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `n-m` is greater than 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i+m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` minus 1 if `a[i+m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i+m]]` is greater than 0. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is 1.**
