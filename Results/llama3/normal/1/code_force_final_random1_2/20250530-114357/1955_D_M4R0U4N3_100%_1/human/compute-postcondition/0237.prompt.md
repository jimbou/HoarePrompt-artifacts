Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - m`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is an integer, `n` is greater than `m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs., and the value of `ans` is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is the first unique value in `b_values`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b` that must have at least 1 unique value, `ans` is an integer, `n` is greater than `m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs., and the value of `ans` is printed, `cnt_b[i]` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is the second unique value in `b_values`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b` that must have at least 2 unique values, `ans` is an integer, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is the third unique value in `b_values`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b` that must have at least 3 unique values, `ans` is an integer, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
