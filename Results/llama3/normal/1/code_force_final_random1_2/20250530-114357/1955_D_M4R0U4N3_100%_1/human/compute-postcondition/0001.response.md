The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, stdin must contain at least 1 test case and _ is 0.
State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
