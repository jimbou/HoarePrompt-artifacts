To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

1. **Understanding the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over a range determined by the integer input from `stdin`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value isn't used within the loop body. The loop will execute as long as there are more integers to read from `stdin`.

2. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`, we primarily focus on the state of `stdin`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more test case in `stdin`.

3. **Considering Other Variables**: Variables like `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`, and `i` are not directly affected by the loop head. Their states do not need to change for the loop to execute again, as the loop's continuation is solely dependent on the availability of input from `stdin`.

4. **Determining the New State**: Given that the loop head does not directly modify or depend on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`, or `i`, and considering that the loop will execute as long as there is another test case in `stdin`, the state primarily changes in the context of `_` and the implication of another test case being present.

**State:** **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) except all `i` which are in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is the last integer in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `n-m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**
