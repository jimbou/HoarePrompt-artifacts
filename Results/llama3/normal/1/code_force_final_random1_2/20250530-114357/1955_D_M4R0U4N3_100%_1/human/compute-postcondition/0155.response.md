Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) except `i` which is the second integer in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is the second integer in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b` that must have at least 2 integers, `n-m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[i]` has been updated to 0, where `i` is the second integer in `b_values`. All other variables remain unchanged.
