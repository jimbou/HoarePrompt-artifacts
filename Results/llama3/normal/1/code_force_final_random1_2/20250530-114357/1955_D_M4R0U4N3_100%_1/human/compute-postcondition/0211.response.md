Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `b_values`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. The conditions related to `a[i]` being in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` being greater than 0 still hold, but the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` has changed.
