To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(m):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`. Since `i` is currently 0, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 1. The value of `m` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` is 0.**
