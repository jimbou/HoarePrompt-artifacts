Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is in the set of unique integers from list `b` (`b_values`), otherwise it remains the same, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is `n`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, and `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains the same, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains the same. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` remains the same, and `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. , and ans is printed which is 1 if curr is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is the first value in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b` that is not empty, and `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains the same, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains the same. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` remains the same, and `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. , and ans is printed which is 1 if curr is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
