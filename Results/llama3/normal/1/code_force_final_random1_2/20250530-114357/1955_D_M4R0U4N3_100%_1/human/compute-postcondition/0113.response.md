Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `n-m` is greater than 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` incremented by 1, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` is also incremented by 1. The value of `ans` is updated based on the new value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
