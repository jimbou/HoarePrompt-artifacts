Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique integers from list `b` (`b_values`). The current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `curr` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The current value of `a[i]` is still in the set of unique integers from list `b` (`b_values`), and the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is still greater than or equal to 0.
