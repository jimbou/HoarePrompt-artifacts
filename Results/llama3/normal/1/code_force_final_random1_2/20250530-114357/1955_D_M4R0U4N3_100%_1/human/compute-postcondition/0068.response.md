Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is in the set of unique integers from list `b` (`b_values`), otherwise it remains the same, `n` is an integer that must be greater than `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is `m + 2`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, and `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains the same, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains the same. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` remains the same, and `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. `ans` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the additional information that `ans` has been increased by 1. This means that the value of `ans` is now one more than its previous value, which was either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions specified in the initial state.
