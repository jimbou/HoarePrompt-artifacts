Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of three lines. It calculates the number of subarrays of a given size that contain at least a specified number of elements from a second array, and prints this count for each test case. The function then resets its internal state, leaving the input stream empty and all variables undefined except for a list `cnt_b` which is reset to zeros.**
