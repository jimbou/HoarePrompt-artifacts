Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `i`, `b_values`, `curr`, `ans` are undefined, stdin is empty.**

The loop has executed all its iterations and has finished. The state of the variables not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged. The variables in the loop head and body are undefined because they are no longer in scope after the loop finishes. The stdin is empty because all test cases have been processed.
