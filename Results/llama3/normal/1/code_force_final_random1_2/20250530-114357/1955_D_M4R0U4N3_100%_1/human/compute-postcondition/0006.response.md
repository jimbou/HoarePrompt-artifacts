Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[0]` is increased by 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value at index `b[0]` in the list `cnt_b` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a total increase of 2 from its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining.
