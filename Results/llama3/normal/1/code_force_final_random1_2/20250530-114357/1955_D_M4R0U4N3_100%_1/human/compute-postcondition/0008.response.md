Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[0]` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 2**

The code increments the value at index `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1. Since `i` is 2, the value at index `b[2]` is incremented. The other variables remain unchanged.
