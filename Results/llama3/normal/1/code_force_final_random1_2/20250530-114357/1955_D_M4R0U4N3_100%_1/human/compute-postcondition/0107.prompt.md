Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is at least m, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 integers where cnt_b[b[i]] is incremented by 1 for all i in range(m), _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, i is m-1, b_values is a set of unique integers from list b, curr is 0, and ans is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, and `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `curr` is 2, otherwise `curr` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1 and `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is either 2 or 3. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `curr` is 3, otherwise `curr` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
