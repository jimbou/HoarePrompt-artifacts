Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in the set of unique integers from list `b` (`b_values`), `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0, and `curr` is 2 if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[i]]` is less than 0, otherwise `curr` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[i]]` is less than 0, then `curr` becomes 2, otherwise `curr` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
