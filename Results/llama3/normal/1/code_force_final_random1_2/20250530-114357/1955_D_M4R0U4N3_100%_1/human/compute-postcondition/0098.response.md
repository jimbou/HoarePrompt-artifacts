Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` is 0, and `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[a[1]]` has been decremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `curr` is still dependent on the condition `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, but since `cnt_b[a[1]]` has been decremented, the value of `curr` may have changed if `a[1]` is in `b_values`.
