Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 2 or 3, `n` is greater than `m+1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1 and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial value of `ans` was 1 or 2, so the new value of `ans` is 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
