Output State: **n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, i is m-1, cnt_b[b[0]] is incremented by 1, cnt_b[b[1]] is incremented by 1, cnt_b[b[2]] is incremented by 1, ..., cnt_b[b[m-1]] is incremented by 1**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` has reached its final value, which is `m-1`. The count of each element in list `b` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of that element in the list.
