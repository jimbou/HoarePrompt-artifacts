Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is `n-m`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `n-m` is greater than or equal to 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and `curr` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then the value of `curr` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `curr` remains unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the state of the variables has been updated accordingly. The value of `i` is now `n-m`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n-m` times. The values of `cnt_b` and `curr` have been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` has been incremented by 1, and `curr` has been decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` has been incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then the value of `curr` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `curr` remains unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
