To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining. However, these states do not directly affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 0**
