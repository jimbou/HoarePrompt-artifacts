Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `m`, the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique values from list `b` (`b_values`), and the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of `curr` has been decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
