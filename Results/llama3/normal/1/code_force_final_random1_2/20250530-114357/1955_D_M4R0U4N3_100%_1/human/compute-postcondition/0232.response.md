Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is the first unique value in `b_values`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b` that must have at least 1 unique value, `ans` is an integer, `n` is greater than `m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs., and the value of `ans` is printed, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**

In this output state, all the variables and conditions from the initial state remain the same, except for `cnt_b[i]`, which is now reset to 0. The value of `ans` is still printed, and the conditions related to `curr` and `k` are still applicable.
