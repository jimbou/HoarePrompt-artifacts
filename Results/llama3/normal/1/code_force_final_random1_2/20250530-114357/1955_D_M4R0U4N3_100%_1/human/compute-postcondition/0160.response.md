Output State: **n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k. Then, it reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to a and b. After executing the code, n, m, and k have integer values, and a and b are lists of integers. Stdin is empty because all inputs have been read.
