Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0. The value of `m` is still greater than 0. The only change is that the count of the element at index 0 of list `b` in the `cnt_b` dictionary is incremented by 1.
