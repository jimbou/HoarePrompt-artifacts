To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must still be greater than `m`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `m`**
