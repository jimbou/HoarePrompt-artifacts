Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 integers, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, i is the last value in b_values, b_values is a set of unique integers from list b that has at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, curr is the number of times a[i] is in b_values and cnt_b[a[i]] is greater than or equal to 0, and ans is 1 if curr is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0.**

The code block reads two lines of input from stdin, assigning the values to n, m, k, a, and b. The values of max_val, cnt_b, _, i, b_values, curr, and ans remain unchanged. The code does not modify any of the existing variables or data structures, only introducing new variables n, m, k, a, and b. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that at least one test case remains.
