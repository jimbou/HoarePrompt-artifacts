The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. The value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique integers `b_values`, and `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`). Therefore, the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is still greater than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `curr` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**
