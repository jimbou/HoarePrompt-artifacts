Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is either 1+1=2 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is 1+0=1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is now 2, otherwise `curr` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
