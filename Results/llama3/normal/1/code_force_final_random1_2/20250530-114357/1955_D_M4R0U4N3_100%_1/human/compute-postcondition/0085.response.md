Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b` that has at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 0, and `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` has been incremented by 1. This means that the count of the occurrence of the integer `b[i]` in the list `b` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
