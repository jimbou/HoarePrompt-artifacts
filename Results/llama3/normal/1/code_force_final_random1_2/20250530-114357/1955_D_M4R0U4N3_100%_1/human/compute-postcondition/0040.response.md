Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i + m]` is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than `m`, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, and `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value at index `a[i + m]` in the list `cnt_b` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
