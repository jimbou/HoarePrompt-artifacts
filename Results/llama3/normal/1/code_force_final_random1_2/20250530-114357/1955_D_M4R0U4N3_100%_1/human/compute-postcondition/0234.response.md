Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is the second unique value in `b_values`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b` that must have at least 2 unique values, `ans` is an integer, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt_b[i]` is reset to 0. The other counts in `cnt_b` for the unique values in `b` remain incremented by 1. The relationship between `n` and `m` remains the same, with `n` being greater than `m`.
