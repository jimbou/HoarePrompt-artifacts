Output State: **max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining**

In this output state, the values of `max_val` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. It then reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 0. Since the code consumes some input from stdin, the number of test cases remaining in stdin is reduced, but there is still at least one test case left.
