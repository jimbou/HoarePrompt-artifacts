Postcondition: ***`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique integers from list `b` (`b_values`).***
