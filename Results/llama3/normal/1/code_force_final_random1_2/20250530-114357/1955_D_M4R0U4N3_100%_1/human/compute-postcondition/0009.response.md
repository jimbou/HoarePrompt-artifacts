Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[i]` is increased by 1 for each `i` in range `m`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is `m-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `cnt_b` list has been updated such that the value at each index `b[i]` has been incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `m`. The variable `i` has reached its final value of `m-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
