To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change.

The loop head is `for i in range(m):`, which means the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The value of `m` does not change, as it is not modified within the loop.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `cnt_b[b[0]]`, `cnt_b[b[1]]`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1**
