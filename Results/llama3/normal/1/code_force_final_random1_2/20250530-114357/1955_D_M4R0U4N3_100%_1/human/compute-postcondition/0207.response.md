Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `m`**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[a[1]]` has been incremented by 1, because `a[i]` is `a[1]` when `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
