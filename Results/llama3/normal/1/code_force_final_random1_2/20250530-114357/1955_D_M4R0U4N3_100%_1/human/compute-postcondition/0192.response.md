Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `m`, and the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique values from list `b` (`b_values`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, meaning that the count of the current value of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` is increased by 1. The value of `i` is still 0. The condition that `n` is greater than `m` and the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique values from list `b` (`b_values`) is still valid.
