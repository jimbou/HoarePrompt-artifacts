The code prints the value of `ans` which is an integer.
Output: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - m`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is an integer, `n` is greater than `m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs., and the value of `ans` is printed**
