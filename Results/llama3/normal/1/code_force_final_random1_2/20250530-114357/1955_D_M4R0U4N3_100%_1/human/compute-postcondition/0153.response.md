Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is `n-m`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b` that must have at least 1 integer, `n-m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first integer in `b_values`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and `curr` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then the value of `curr` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `curr` remains unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and the value of `ans` is printed, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**

The code sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0, where `i` is the first integer in `b_values`. This means that the count of `i` in `cnt_b` is reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
