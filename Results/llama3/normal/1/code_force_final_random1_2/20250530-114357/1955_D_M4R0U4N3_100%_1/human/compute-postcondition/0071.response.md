Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the value of `ans`, which is determined by the conditions described in the precondition.

The value of `ans` is initially 0 and is increased by 1 if the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 (`curr`) is greater than or equal to `k`. 

The value of `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, and decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0. 

The value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains the same. 

The value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains the same.

Therefore, the print statement will print the total number of times the conditions `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` are met.

Output: **the total number of times the conditions curr is greater than or equal to k are met**
