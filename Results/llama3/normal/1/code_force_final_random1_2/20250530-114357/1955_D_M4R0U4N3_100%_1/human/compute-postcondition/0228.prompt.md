Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `m`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1. If all `a[i]` are in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0 for all `i`, then `curr` is `m`. Otherwise, `curr` is less than `m` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1 for some `i`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `m`. If the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique values from list `b` (`b_values`), then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and if the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If the current value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 1 or 2, `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 2 or 3, `n` is greater than `m+1`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1 and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
