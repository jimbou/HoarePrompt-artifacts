Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[0]` is increased by 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt_b` at the index equal to the first element of list `b` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
