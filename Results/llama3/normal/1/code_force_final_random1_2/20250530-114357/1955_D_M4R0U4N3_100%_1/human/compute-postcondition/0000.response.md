Output State: **max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_i <= 10^6).**

The code initializes two variables: `max_val` is set to 1000000, and `cnt_b` is created as a list of 1000001 zeros, with an index range from 0 to 1000000. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as the code does not interact with it. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not modified by the code snippet.
