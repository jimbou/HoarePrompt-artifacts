Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the count of each element in array `b`. This is done to efficiently check if an element from array `a` is present in array `b` and to maintain the count of matching elements.

2.  The program reads the input for each test case, which includes the sizes of arrays `a` and `b` (`n` and `m`), the required number of matching elements `k`, and the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

3.  It then iterates over the elements of array `b` and updates the count in `cnt_b` accordingly.

4.  The program maintains a set `b_values` to store unique elements from array `b` for efficient lookups.

5.  It initializes variables `ans` to store the count of good subarrays and `curr` to keep track of the current number of matching elements in the sliding window.

6.  The program then processes the elements of array `a` using a sliding window approach. For each position in the array, it checks if the current element is in `b_values` and updates `curr` accordingly. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

7.  After processing all elements in the sliding window, the program prints the count of good subarrays for the current test case.

8.  Finally, the program resets the count in `cnt_b` for each element in `b_values` to prepare for the next test case.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly reads input, processes the data, and prints the expected output for each test case. It also resets its internal state correctly after processing each test case.

Correctness: **True**
