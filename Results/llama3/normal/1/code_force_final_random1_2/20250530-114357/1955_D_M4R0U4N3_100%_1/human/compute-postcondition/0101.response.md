Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, and `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `curr` is 2, otherwise `curr` is 1.***
