Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is 2. Otherwise, `curr` is 1.***
