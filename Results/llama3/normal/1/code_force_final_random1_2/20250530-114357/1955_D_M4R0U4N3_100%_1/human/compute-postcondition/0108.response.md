Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is `m-1`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, the current value of `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` and is greater than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is 0.***
