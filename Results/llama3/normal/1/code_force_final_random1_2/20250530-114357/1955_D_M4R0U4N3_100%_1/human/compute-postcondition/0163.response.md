The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1**
