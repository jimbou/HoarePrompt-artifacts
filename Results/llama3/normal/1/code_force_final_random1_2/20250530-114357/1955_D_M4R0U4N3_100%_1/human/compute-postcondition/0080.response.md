The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `range(int(input()))`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `range(int(input()))`. If `range(int(input()))` has at least one more iteration, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `range(int(input()))` has at least 1 test case remaining. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `range(int(input()))` must have at least 1 test case remaining and `_` is 1.
State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `i` is 0 and the value at index `a[i]` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is the last value in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b` that has at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains the same, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains the same. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` remains the same, and `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. , and ans is printed which is 1 if curr is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0**
