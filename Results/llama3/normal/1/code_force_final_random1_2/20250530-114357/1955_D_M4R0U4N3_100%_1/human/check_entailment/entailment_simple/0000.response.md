Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the sliding window technique to count the number of good subsegments in array a. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes a count array `cnt_b` to keep track of the count of each element in array b. This is necessary to efficiently check if an element in array a is present in array b.

2. The program reads the input for each test case and initializes the necessary variables.

3. It then counts the occurrences of each element in array b and stores them in `cnt_b`.

4. It creates a set `b_values` to store the unique elements in array b. This is used to check if an element in array a is present in array b in constant time.

5. The program then initializes the answer `ans` to 0 and the current count `curr` to 0.

6. It then processes the first window of size m in array a. For each element in the window, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.

7. If `curr` is greater than or equal to k, it increments `ans`.

8. The program then slides the window to the right by one element at a time. For each window, it updates `curr` by incrementing the count of the element going out of the window and decrementing the count of the element entering the window. If `curr` is greater than or equal to k, it increments `ans`.

9. Finally, the program prints the answer `ans` and resets the count array `cnt_b` for the next test case.

Correctness: **True**
