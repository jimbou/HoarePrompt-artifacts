Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b`, `ans` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `m`. If the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique values from list `b` (`b_values`), then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and if the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If the current value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.**
