You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is the first value in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b` that is not empty, and `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `curr` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains the same, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains the same. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` remains the same, and `curr` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. , and ans is printed which is 1 if curr is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is 0
```
for i in b_values:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
