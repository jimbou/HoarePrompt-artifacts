Output State: **max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index b[i] is increased by 1 for each i in range m, n is an integer, m is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, i is m-1, b_values is a set of unique integers from list b, ans is 0, curr is 0.**

The code snippet creates three new variables: `b_values`, `ans`, and `curr`. `b_values` is a set containing unique integers from the list `b`. `ans` and `curr` are both initialized to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
