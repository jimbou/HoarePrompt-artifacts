Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is the third unique value in `b_values`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, ..., `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values from list `b` that must have at least 3 unique values, `ans` is an integer, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[i]` has been updated to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is greater than `m` and `i` is the third unique value in `b_values` still holds. The counts of other unique values in `b` remain incremented by 1.
