Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range(`m`) and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case remaining, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `n-m` is greater than 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` incremented by 1, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `curr` remains unchanged.***
