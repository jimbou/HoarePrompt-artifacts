Output State: **t is at least 1, i is k, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, ans is the concatenation of all characters in s that are part of a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters plus tmp plus 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times, s is an empty string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0, tmp is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The code modifies the value of `ans` by appending `tmp` and then appending `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` also remains unchanged. The rest of the variables (`t`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, and `tmp`) are not affected by the code and retain their initial values. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-1`.
