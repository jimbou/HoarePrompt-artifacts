The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. The number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed**
