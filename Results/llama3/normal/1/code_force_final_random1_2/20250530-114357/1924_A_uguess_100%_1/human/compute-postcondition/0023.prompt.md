Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, cnt is 0, cur is 0, ans is an empty string, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the first character of `s` if `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character in the string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0 if `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string in the alphabet (0-25) which is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If the original value of `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the first character of `s` plus the second character of `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the second character of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string in the alphabet (0-25), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is either 2 or 3, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is either the second character of `s` plus the third character of `s` or the first character of `s` plus the second character of `s` plus the third character of `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either the second character of `s` or the first character of `s` plus the second character of `s`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is not equal to 0, then `cur` is `1 << cur_ss + 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
