Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or 'b', `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `cur` has a bit set at position `i`, then `tmp` is 'b' and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.***
