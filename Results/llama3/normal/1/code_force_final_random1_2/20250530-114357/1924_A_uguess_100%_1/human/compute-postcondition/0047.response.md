Output State: **t is at least 2, i is either 1 or k+1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 0, ans is an empty string, s is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0, tmp is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code snippet reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m`. It then reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The variables `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` are initialized to 0, 0, and an empty string, respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
