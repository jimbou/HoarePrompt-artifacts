Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cnt is 1 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise cnt is 0, ans is the first character in the string s if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise ans is an empty string, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the first character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), s is not empty, and stdin contains t-6 test cases if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-5 test cases, cur is 0 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise no changes are made.***
