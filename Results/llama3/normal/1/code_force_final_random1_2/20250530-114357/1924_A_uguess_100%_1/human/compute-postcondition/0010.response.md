Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the first character of `s` if `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character in the string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0 if `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.***
