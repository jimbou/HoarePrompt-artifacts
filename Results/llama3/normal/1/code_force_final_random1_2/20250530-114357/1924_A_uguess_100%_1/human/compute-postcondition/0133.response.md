Output: **The concatenation of all characters in the string s that make cur equal to (1 << k) - 1 plus tmp plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), where tmp is a string of length k consisting of the first k letters of the alphabet if the current value of cur has a zero at the i-th bit position, otherwise tmp is an empty string, and 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) is a string of 'a's repeated n - cnt - 1 times**
