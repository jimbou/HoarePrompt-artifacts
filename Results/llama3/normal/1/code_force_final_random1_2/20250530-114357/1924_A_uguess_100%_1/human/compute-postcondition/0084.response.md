Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 2, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), tmp is 'c', and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is being printed.**

The first line assigns the character 'c' to `tmp`, since `i` is 2 and `ord('a')` is 97, `ord('a') + i` equals 99, which is the ASCII value of 'c'. The second line breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is part of, but since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the given code snippet, its effect cannot be determined. No other variables are affected.
