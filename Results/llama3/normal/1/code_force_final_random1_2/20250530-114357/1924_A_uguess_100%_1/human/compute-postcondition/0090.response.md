Postcondition: **t is at least 2, i is either 1 or k+1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is either 0 or a value less than (1 << k) - 1, tmp is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, ans is a string that contains the original value of ans plus the value of tmp plus n - cnt - 1 occurrences of the character 'a', and the string ans is being printed.**
