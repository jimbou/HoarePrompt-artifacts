Output: **t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cnt is the number of times cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, ans is the concatenation of all characters in the string s that make cur equal to (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise no changes are made, and stdin contains t-5 test cases if cur is not equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-6 test cases. The current value of cnt is greater than or equal to n, and 'YES' is printed**
