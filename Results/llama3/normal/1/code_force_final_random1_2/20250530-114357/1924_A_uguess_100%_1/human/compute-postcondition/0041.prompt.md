Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. The number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. The number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed. If the current value of `cur` does not have the bit at position `i` set, then `tmp` is set to 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 1, i is 1, n is an integer, k is greater than 1, m is an integer, cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, ans is the concatenation of all characters in s that are part of a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, s is an empty string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0, tmp is either an empty string or 'b', stdin contains t-1 test cases. The number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters is less than n, and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or 'b', `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `cur` has a bit set at position `i`, then `tmp` is 'b' and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
