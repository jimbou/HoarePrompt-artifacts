Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `m` is an integer equal to the third input, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `s` is a string with at least three characters, if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2, `ans` is the first character in the string `s` plus the second character in the string `s`, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the second character in the string `s`, and `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `1 << cur_ss + (1 << k) - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `cur_ss` is now updated to be the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
