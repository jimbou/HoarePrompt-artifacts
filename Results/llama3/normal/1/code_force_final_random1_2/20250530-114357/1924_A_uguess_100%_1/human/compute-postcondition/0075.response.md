Output State: **t is at least 2, i is either 1 or k+1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is either 0 or a value less than (1 << k) - 1, tmp is an empty string, and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is being printed**

The code sets the value of `tmp` to an empty string. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is still being printed.
