Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character in the string in the alphabet (0-25). The current value of `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, meaning all bits corresponding to the positions of the characters in the alphabet up to `k` are set in `cur`.***
