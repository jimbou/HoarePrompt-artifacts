Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character in the string in the alphabet (0-25)**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `cur_ss`, which is now assigned the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25). This is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the first character `ss`.
