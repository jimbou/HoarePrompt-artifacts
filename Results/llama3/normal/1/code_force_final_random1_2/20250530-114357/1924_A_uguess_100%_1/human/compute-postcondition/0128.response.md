To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 2, and `tmp` is 'a' since `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `k` remains the same.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and at least 2, `m` is an integer equal to the third input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s` that make `cur` equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise no changes are made, `tmp` is 'a' if the current value of `cur` has a zero at the `i`-th bit position, otherwise `tmp` is an empty string, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise stdin contains `t-6` test cases, and `cnt` is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed, and `tmp` is an empty string since `i` is 2**
