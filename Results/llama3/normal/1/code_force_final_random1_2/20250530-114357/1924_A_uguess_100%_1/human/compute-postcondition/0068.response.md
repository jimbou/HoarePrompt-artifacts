Output State: **t is at least 2, i is either 1 or k+1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is either 0 or a value less than (1 << k) - 1, tmp is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all characters in the string `s`. The variable `cnt` now holds the total count of times the bit pattern `(1 << k) - 1` was encountered in the string, and `ans` contains all the characters from `s` that were part of this pattern. The variable `cur` is either reset to 0 if the last character in `s` completed the pattern, or it holds a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` if the pattern was not completed. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
