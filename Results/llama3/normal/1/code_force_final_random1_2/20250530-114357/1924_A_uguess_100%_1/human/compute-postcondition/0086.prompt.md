Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, i is either 1 or k+1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is either 0 or a value less than (1 << k) - 1, tmp is an empty string, and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 2, i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is at least 1, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), tmp is either an empty string or 'a', and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is being printed. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of cur is 0, then tmp is 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer that is at least 2, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), tmp is either an empty string or 'a', and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is being printed. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of cur is 0, then tmp is 'a'. Otherwise, tmp is a string containing a single character which is the i-th letter of the alphabet (1-indexed).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 2, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is being printed. If cur & 1 << i == 0, then tmp is 'c', otherwise tmp is either an empty string or 'a'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
