Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. The current value of `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`.***
