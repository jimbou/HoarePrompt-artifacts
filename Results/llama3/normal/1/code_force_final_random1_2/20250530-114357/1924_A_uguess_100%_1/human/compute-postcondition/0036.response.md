Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 1, n is an integer, k is greater than 1, m is an integer, cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, ans is the concatenation of all characters in s that are part of a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, s is an empty string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0, tmp is 'b', stdin contains t-1 test cases. The number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters is less than n, and 'NO' is printed.**

The code assigns the character 'b' to the variable tmp, which was previously an empty string. No other variables are affected by the code. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and the state of the input stream stdin remains the same.
