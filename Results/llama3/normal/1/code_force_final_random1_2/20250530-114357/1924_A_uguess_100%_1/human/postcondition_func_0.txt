This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, k, m) and a string s of length m. It then checks if the string s contains at least n substrings of length k consisting of distinct characters. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints a string that is the concatenation of all characters in s that are part of a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, followed by a character that is not in the current substring, and then 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times, where cnt is the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters.
