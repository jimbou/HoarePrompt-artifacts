Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n` (1 <= n <= 26), `k` (1 <= k <= 26), and `m` (1 <= m <= 1000). The second line contains a string `s` of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or `k`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is either the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters or the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters plus `tmp` plus 'a' repeated (`n - cnt - 1`) times, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, i is either 1 or k+1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is an integer, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is either 0 or a value less than (1 << k) - 1, tmp is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, ans is a string that contains the original value of ans plus the value of tmp plus n - cnt - 1 occurrences of the character 'a', and the string ans is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cnt is the number of times cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, ans is the concatenation of all characters in the string s that make cur equal to (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise no changes are made, and stdin contains t-5 test cases if cur is not equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-6 test cases. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, i is set to k, tmp is a string of length k consisting of the first k letters of the alphabet if the current value of cur has a zero at the i-th bit position, otherwise tmp is an empty string, ans is updated to include tmp plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), 'NO' is printed, and ans is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
