Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 3, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `m` is an integer equal to the third input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s` that make `cur` equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise no changes are made, `tmp` is an empty string, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise stdin contains `t-6` test cases, and `cnt` is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and at least 1, `m` is an integer equal to the third input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s` that make `cur` equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise no changes are made, `tmp` is 'a' if the current value of `cur` has a zero at the `i`-th bit position, otherwise `tmp` is an empty string, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise stdin contains `t-6` test cases, and `cnt` is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and at least 2, `m` is an integer equal to the third input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s` that make `cur` equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise no changes are made, `tmp` is 'a' if the current value of `cur` has a zero at the `i`-th bit position, otherwise `tmp` is an empty string, and stdin contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise stdin contains `t-6` test cases, and `cnt` is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed, and `tmp` is 'a' since `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input and at least 2, `m` is an integer equal to the third input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s` that make `cur` equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise no changes are made, `tmp` is 'd' if the current value of `cur` has a zero at the `i`-th bit position, otherwise `tmp` is 'a', and stdin contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise stdin contains `t-6` test cases, and `cnt` is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
