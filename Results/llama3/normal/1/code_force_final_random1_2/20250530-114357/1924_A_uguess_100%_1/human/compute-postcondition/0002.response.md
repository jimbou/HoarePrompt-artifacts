Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, cnt is 0, cur is 0, ans is an empty string, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code reads `t` test cases from stdin, and since one test case has been processed, `t-1` test cases remain in stdin. The variables `n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned integer values from the first line of the test case, and `s` is assigned a string value from the second line of the test case. The variables `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` are initialized to 0, 0, and an empty string, respectively, as specified in the code.
