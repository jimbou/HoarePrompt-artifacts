Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If `cur` is equal to 2 to the power of `k` minus 1, then `cnt` is increased by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is increased by `ss`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
