Postcondition: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer that is at least 2, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), tmp is either an empty string or 'a', and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is being printed. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of cur is 0, then tmp is 'a'. Otherwise, tmp is a string containing a single character which is the i-th letter of the alphabet (1-indexed).**
