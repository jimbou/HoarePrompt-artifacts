Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` has been processed and all substrings of length `k` consisting of distinct characters have been found. The count of such substrings is stored in `cnt`, and the concatenation of all characters in these substrings is stored in `ans`. The string `s` is now empty, and the last character processed is stored in `ss`. The position of this character in the alphabet is stored in `cur_ss`, and the current state of the bit mask `cur` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
