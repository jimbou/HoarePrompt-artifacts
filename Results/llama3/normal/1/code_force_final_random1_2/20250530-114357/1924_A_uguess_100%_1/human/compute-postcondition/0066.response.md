Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), `cnt` is increased by 1, `cur` is 0, `ans` is increased by `ss`, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

The code block increments the value of `cnt` by 1, resets the value of `cur` to 0, and appends the value of `ss` to `ans`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged as it still contains `t-3` test cases.
