The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or `k`, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is either 1 or `k+1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is either the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters or the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters plus `tmp` plus 'a' repeated (`n - cnt - 1`) times, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.**
