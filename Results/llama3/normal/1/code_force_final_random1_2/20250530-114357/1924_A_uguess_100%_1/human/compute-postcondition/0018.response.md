Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either the second character of `s` or the first character of `s` plus the second character of `s`**

The value of `cur_ss` is updated to be the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), which is calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. The other variables remain unchanged.
