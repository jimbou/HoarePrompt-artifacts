Output State: **cnt is increased by 1, cur is 0, ans is increased by the second character in the string s, t is at least 2, i is either 1 or k+1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a non-empty string, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the second character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), tmp is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, resets `cur` to 0, and appends the second character of the string `s` to `ans`. The remaining variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
