Output State: **t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cnt is the number of times cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, ans is the concatenation of all characters in the string s that make cur equal to (1 << k) - 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise no changes are made, and stdin contains t-5 test cases if cur is not equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-6 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged.
*   The value of `cnt` is the number of times `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, which means the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is met.
*   The value of `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s` that make `cur` equal to `(1 << k) - 1`. This means that `ans` will contain all the characters that satisfy the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1`.
*   The value of `ss` is the last character in the string `s`.
*   The value of `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25).
*   The value of `cur` is 0 if `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise no changes are made.
*   The value of `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.
