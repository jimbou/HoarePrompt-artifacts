Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the first character of `s` if `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string in the alphabet (0-25) which is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is now equal to `1 << cur_ss` more than its previous value, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` has been increased by `1 << cur_ss`, which is equivalent to 2 to the power of `cur_ss`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cur_ss` is still equal to the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25). The values of `cnt` and `ans` are still dependent on whether `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1 or not. The string `s` still has at least 2 characters, and `ss` is still the second character in the string. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-1`.
