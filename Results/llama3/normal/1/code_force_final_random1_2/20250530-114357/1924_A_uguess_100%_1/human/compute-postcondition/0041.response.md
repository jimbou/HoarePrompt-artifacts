Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is `k`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. The number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed.**

The loop will execute `k` times, and after each iteration, the value of `i` will increase by 1. Since `k` is an integer, the loop will terminate when `i` reaches `k`. The value of `tmp` will be set to a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive) if the current value of `cur` does not have the bit at position `i` set. Otherwise, `tmp` will remain unchanged. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
