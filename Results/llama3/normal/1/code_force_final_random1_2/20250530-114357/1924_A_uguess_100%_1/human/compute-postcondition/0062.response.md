To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects accordingly.


The loop head is `for ss in s:`, which means we are iterating over the characters in the string `s`. The only object in the loop head is `ss`, which is the current character being processed.


At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, `ss` must be the next character in the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, there must be at least one more character after the second character.


State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**
