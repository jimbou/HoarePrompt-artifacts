Postcondition: **t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cnt is 0, ans is an empty string, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the first character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0, tmp is an empty string, s is not empty, and stdin contains t-5 test cases. The current value of cur does not have the bit set at the position corresponding to cur_ss, i.e., (cur & 1 << cur_ss) equals 0.**
