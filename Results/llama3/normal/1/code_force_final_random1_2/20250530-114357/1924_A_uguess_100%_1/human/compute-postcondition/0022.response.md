Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string in the alphabet (0-25), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is either 2 or 3, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is either the second character of `s` plus the third character of `s` or the first character of `s` plus the second character of `s` plus the third character of `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either the second character of `s` or the first character of `s` plus the second character of `s`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is not equal to 0, then `cur` is `1 << cur_ss + 1`***
