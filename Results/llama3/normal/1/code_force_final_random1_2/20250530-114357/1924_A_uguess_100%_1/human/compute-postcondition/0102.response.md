Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is either 2 or k+2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `m` is an integer equal to the third input, `cnt` is 1 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise cnt is 0, `ans` is the first character in the string s if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise ans is an empty string, `ss` is the second character in the string s, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), `s` is a string with at least two characters, and stdin contains t-6 test cases if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-5 test cases, `cur` is 0 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_ss` has been updated to be the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), which is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of `ss`. The other variables remain unchanged.
