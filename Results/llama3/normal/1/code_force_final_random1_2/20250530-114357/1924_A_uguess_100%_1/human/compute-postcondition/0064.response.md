Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), `cur` is increased by 2 to the power of `cur_ss`, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated by adding 2 to the power of `cur_ss` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state. The value of `cur_ss` is used to calculate the new value of `cur`, which is increased by 2 to the power of `cur_ss`. The rest of the variables and the stdin remain unaffected.
