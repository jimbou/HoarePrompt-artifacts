Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 2, ans is the first character in the string s plus the second character in the string s, and stdin contains t-6 test cases. Otherwise, cnt is 1, ans is the second character in the string s, and stdin contains t-5 test cases. ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the second character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), and s is a string with at least two characters. If cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0, then cur is either 1 << cur_ss or 1 << cur_ss + (1 << k) - 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
