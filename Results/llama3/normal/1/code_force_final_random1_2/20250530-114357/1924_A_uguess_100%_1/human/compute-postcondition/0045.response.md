Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or `k`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is either the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters or the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters plus `tmp` plus 'a' repeated (`n - cnt - 1`) times, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed.**
