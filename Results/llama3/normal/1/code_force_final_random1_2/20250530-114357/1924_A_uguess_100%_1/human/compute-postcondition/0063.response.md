Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `cur_ss` is now explicitly defined as the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), which is calculated using the ASCII values of the characters. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
