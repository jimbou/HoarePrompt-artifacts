stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and m, where n, k, and m are non-negative integers and 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26 and 1 <= m <= 1000. The second line contains a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
