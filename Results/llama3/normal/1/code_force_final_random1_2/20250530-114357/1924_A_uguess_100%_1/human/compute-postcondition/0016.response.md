Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string in the alphabet (0-25) which is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If the original value of `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the first character of `s` plus the second character of `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the second character of `s`.***
