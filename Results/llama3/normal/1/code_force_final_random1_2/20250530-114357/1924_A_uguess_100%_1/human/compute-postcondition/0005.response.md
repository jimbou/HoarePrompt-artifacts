Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character in the string in the alphabet (0-25). The current value of `cur` is such that the bit corresponding to the position of `ss` in the alphabet is not set (i.e., `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`).***
