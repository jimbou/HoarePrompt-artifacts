Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cnt is 0, ans is an empty string, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0, tmp is an empty string, and stdin contains t-5 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cnt is 1 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise cnt is 0, ans is the first character in the string s if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise ans is an empty string, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the first character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), s is not empty, and stdin contains t-6 test cases if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t-5 test cases, cur is 0 if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, otherwise no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 2, ans is the first character in the string s plus the second character in the string s, and stdin contains t-6 test cases. Otherwise, cnt is 1, ans is the second character in the string s, and stdin contains t-5 test cases. ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the second character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), and s is a string with at least two characters. If cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0, then cur is either 1 << cur_ss or 1 << cur_ss + (1 << k) - 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cur_ss is the position of the third character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), ss is the third character in the string s, s is a string with at least three characters. If cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is either 3 or 2, ans is either the first character in the string s plus the second character in the string s plus the third character in the string s or the second character in the string s plus the third character in the string s, and cur is 0. Otherwise, cnt is 1, ans is the second character in the string s, and stdin contains t-5 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
