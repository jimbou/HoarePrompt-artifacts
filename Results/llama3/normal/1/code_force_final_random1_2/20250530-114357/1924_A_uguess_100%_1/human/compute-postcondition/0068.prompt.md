Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, i is either 1 or k+1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, cnt is 0, ans is an empty string, s is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 0, tmp is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and stdin contains t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character in the string `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is increased by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is increased by the second character in the string `s`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If `cur` is equal to 2 to the power of `k` minus 1, then `cnt` is increased by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is increased by `ss`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
