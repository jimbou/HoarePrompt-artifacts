Output State: **t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cnt is 0, ans is an empty string, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the first character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), cur is 1 << cur_ss, tmp is an empty string, s is not empty, and stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of cur has been updated to 1 << cur_ss, which means the bit at the position corresponding to cur_ss is now set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition (cur & 1 << cur_ss) equals 1 is now true.
