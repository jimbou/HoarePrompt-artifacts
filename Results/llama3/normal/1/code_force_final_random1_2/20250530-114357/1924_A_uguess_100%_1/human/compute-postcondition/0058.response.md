Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0-25), `tmp` is either an empty string or a character from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive), `cur` is increased by 2 to the power of `cur_ss`, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated by adding 2 to the power of `cur_ss` to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The position of `cur_ss` in the alphabet is used to calculate the value added to `cur`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial conditions.
