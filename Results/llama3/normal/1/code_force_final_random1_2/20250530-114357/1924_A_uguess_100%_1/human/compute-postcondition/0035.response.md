The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are part of a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the original string, `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. The number of times the string `s` contains a substring of length `k` consisting of distinct characters is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed.**
