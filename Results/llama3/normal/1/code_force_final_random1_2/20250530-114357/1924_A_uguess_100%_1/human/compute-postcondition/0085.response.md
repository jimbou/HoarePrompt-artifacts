Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 2, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is being printed. If cur & 1 << i == 0, then tmp is 'c', otherwise tmp is either an empty string or 'a'.***
