Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes a counter `cnt` to 0, which keeps track of the number of times the string s contains a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters.
2. It initializes a variable `cur` to 0, which is used to keep track of the current substring of length k consisting of distinct characters.
3. It iterates through the string s, and for each character, it checks if the character is not already present in the current substring (i.e., `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`). If it's not present, it adds the character to the current substring (i.e., `cur += 1 << cur_ss`).
4. If the current substring is complete (i.e., `cur == (1 << k) - 1`), it increments the counter `cnt` and resets the current substring to 0.
5. After iterating through the entire string s, it checks if the counter `cnt` is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s.
6. If `cnt` is less than n, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that is the concatenation of all characters in s that are part of a substring of length k consisting of distinct characters, followed by a character that is not in the current substring, and then 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n is 1 or k is 1, and it also handles the case when the input string s is empty.

Correctness: **True**
