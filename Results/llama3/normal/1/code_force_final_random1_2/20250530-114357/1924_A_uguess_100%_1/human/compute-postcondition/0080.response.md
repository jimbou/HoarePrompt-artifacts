The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer that is at least 2, m is an integer, cnt is an integer less than n, ans is a string, ss is the last character in the original string, cur_ss is the position of the last character in the original string in the alphabet (0-25), tmp is either an empty string or 'a', and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and "NO" is being printed. If the bit at position i in the binary representation of cur is 0, then tmp is 'a'.**
