Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, i is either 2 or k+2, n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, m is an integer equal to the third input, cnt is 0, ans is an empty string, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the first character in the string s in the alphabet (0-25), s is not empty, and stdin contains t-5 test cases. If the bit at the position cur_ss in the binary representation of cur is 0, then cur is updated to 1 << cur_ss. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
