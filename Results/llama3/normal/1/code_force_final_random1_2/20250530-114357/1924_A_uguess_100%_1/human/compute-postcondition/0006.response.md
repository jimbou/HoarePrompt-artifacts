Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 plus the initial value of `cur` with the bit corresponding to the position of `ss` in the alphabet set (i.e., `cur & 1 << cur_ss != 0`), `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cur_ss` is the position of the first character in the string in the alphabet (0-25).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` has been updated by setting the bit corresponding to the position of the first character of the string `s` in the alphabet. The other variables remain unchanged.
