Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is at least 2. If the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is 1 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
