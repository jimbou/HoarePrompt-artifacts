Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is at least 3, `i` is 2, `count` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `q` is still 0, `stdin` still contains `t-1` strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is still a string of 0s and 1s with a length of at least 3, and `i` is still 2.
