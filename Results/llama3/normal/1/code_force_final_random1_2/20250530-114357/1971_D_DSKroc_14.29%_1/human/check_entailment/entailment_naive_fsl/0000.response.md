Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string and counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'. This is because each such occurrence requires a cut to separate the '1' and '0' into different pieces. The program then adds 1 to this count, because the remaining piece (which may be a single character) also needs to be counted.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If the string is already sorted, the count will be 0, and the program will output 1, which is correct.
* If the string has only one character, the count will be 0, and the program will output 1, which is correct.
* If the string has multiple characters and needs to be cut into multiple pieces, the program will correctly count the number of cuts needed.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
