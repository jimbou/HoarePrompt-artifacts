Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is at least 3, `i` is 2. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in string `s` is greater than the integer value of the character at index `i+1`, then `count` is increased by 1.***
