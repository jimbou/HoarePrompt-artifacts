Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
    print(count + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), count is the number of times a character in s is greater than the next character, i is the last index of s, and the value of count + 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), count is equal to the number of times a character in s is greater than the next character, and the value of count + 1 is being printed, i is equal to the last index of s, and count + 1 (where count + 1 is the number of times a character in s is greater than the next character plus one) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), count is the number of times a character in s is greater than the next character plus one, and i is equal to the last index of s, and count + 1 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
