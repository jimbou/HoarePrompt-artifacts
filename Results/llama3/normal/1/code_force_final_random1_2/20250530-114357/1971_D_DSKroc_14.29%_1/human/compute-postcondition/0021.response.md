Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, if the current value of s[i] is greater than s[i + 1], then count is 1 and the value of count + 1 is being printed, otherwise count remains 0 and the value of count + 1 is being printed***
