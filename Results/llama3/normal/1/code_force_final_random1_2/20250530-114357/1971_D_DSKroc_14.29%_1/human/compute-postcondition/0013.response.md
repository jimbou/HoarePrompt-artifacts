Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), count is the number of times a character in s is greater than the next character, i is the last index of s.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `count` will be the total number of times a character in string `s` is greater than the next character. The value of `i` will be the last index of string `s`. The values of `t`, `q`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
