Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `q` is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is greater than i + 1 and is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), if the current value of s[i] is greater than s[i + 1], then count is 3, otherwise count is 2, i is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is greater than `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
