The code prints the value of `count + 1`, where `count` is the number of times a character in `s` is greater than the next character plus one.
Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, q is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), count is the number of times a character in s is greater than the next character plus one, and i is equal to the last index of s, and count + 1 is printed**
