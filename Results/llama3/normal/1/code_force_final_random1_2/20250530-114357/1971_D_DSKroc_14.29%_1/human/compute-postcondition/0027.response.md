Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is greater than i + 1 and is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), if the current value of s[i] is greater than s[i + 1], then count is 3, otherwise count is 2, i is increased by 1***
