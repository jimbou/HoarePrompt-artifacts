Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is at least 3. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is greater than the integer value of the character at index `i+1` in `s`, then `count` is 2 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count` and `i`.***
