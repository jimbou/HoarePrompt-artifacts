Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is at least 2 and at most 500 (inclusive). If the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is 1 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `count` and `i` remain unchanged.***
