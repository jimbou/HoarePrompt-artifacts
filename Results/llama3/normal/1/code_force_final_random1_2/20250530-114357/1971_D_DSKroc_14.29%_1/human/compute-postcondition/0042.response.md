Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is at least 3 and at most 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in string `s` is greater than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1`, then `count` is increased by 1.***
