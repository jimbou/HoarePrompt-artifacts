Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is at least 3 and at most 500 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `count` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The string `s` still consists of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is at least 3 and at most 500 (inclusive). The value of `i` is still 1.
