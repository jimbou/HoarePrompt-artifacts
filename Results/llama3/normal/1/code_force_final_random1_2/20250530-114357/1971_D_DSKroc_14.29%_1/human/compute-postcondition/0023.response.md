Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, q is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of each string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, where the length of the string is between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, if the current value of s[i] is greater than s[i + 1], then count is 2 and the value of count + 1 is being printed, otherwise count is 1 and the value of count + 1 is being printed, i is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of count has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2, depending on the previous value of s[i] and s[i+1]. The other variables remain unchanged.
