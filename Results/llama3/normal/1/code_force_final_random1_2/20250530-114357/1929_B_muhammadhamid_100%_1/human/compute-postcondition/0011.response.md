The code prints the value of `k` divided by 2 and then adds 1 to it.
Since `k` is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.
Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)))**
