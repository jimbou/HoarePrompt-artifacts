The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the range of the loop, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `_` and the range of the loop. If `_` is less than the range of the loop, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least one less line of input. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and stdin contains at least one less line of input.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least one less line of input.**
