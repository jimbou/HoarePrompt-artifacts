Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is `t`, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n` and `k` will still be integers, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t` (which represents the number of test cases), and the standard input `stdin` will be empty because all input lines have been processed by the loop.
