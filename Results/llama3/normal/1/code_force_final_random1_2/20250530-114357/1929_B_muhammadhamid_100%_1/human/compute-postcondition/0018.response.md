Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least one less line of input, the value 1 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as integers. The value of `_` is still 1. The stdin still contains at least one less line of input. The value 1 is still being printed. However, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
