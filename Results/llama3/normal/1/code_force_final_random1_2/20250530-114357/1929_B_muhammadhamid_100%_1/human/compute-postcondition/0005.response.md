The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables `n`, `k`, or `_`, their values remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, and 1 is still being printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, and 1 is being printed, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
