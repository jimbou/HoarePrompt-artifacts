To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

The `int(input())` expression reads an integer from the standard input. Since the loop has already executed once, the first line of input has been consumed. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more line of input available.

The other variables `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least one more line of input.**
