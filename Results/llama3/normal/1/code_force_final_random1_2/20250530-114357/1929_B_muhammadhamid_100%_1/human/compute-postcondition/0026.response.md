Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least one less line of input.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the integers obtained from the input, which is split into two parts by the `split()` function. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The stdin now contains at least one less line of input, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
