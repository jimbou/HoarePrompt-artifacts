Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least one less line of input. If `k` equals 1, the value 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n` plus `n` minus 2, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `k` divided by 2 plus 1 is printed.***
