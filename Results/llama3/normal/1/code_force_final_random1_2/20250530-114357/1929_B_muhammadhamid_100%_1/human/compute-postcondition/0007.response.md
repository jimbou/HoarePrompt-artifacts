Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input. If `k` equals 1, then 1 is printed and the loop moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken. The current value of `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`.***
