Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input. If `k` equals 1, then 1 is printed and the loop moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken. Additionally, if `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the value of k // 2 + 1 is being printed.***
