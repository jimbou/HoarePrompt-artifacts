Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least one less line of input. If `k` equals 1, then 1 is printed and the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for this iteration, moving to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n` plus the difference between `n` and 2, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed.***
