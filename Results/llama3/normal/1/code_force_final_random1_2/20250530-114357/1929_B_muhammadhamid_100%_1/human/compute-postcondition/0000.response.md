The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and the input from stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If the input from stdin has at least 1 line the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple lines of input. So for the loop to be executed  the input from stdin must have at least 1 line and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input that must have at least 1 line, `_` is 0**
