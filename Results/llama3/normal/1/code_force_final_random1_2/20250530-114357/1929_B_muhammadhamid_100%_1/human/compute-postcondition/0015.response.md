Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least one less line of input.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the two integers from the input, which are split by a space and converted to integers using the `map` function. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains at least one less line of input, since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
