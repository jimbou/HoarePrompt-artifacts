Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input. If `k` equals 1, then 1 is printed and the loop moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken. Additionally, if `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the value of k // 2 + 1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least one less line of input. If `k` equals 1, the value 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n` plus `n` minus 2, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `k` divided by 2 plus 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least one less line of input. If `k` equals 1, then 1 is printed and the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for this iteration, moving to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n` plus the difference between `n` and 2, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
