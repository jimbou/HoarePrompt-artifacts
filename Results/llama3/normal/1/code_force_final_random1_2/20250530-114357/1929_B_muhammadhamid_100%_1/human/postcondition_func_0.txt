This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k. It then processes each pair of n and k, and prints the result of a calculation based on the values of k and n. The function continues this process until all input lines have been processed, leaving stdin empty.
