Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input. If `k` equals 1, then 1 is printed and the loop moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken. Additionally, `k` is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2))., and the value of k // 2 + 1 is being printed**
