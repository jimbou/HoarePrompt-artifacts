Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least one less line of input, 1 is being printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for this iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as integers. The value of `_` is still 2. The stdin still contains at least one less line of input. The number 1 is still being printed. Additionally, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for this iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
