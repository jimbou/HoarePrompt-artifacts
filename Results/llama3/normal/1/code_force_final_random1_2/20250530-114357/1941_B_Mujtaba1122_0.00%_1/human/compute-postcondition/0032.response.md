Functionality: This function takes a list of integers and its length as input, modifies the list by setting the first n-2 elements to 0, and then subtracts the sum of the original values of the first n-2 elements from the second last element and the sum of the original values of the first n-1 elements from the last element. It then calls another function `func_1` with the modified list and its length, and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns True, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
