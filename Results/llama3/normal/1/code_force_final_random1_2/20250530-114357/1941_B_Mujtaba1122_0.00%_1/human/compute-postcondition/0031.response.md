Postcondition: **The list remains unchanged with the first n-2 elements being 0, the second last element being greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus the sum of all the original values of the first n-2 elements, and the last element being greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus the sum of all the original values of the first n-1 elements. The value of n remains the same, equal to the length of the list and at least 3, and i remains n-2. Additionally, if the function func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**
