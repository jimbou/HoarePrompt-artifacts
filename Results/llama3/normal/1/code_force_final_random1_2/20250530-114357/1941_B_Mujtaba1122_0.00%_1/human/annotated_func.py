#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: `list` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list), and the first `n` elements of `list` are 0.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the first n elements of the list are indeed 0, where n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if the first n elements of a given list are 0. It accepts a list of integers and a non-negative integer n as parameters, where n is less than or equal to the length of the list. The function returns True if all the first n elements are 0, and False otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, n is a positive integer such that n is equal to the length of list and n >= 3.
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: list is a list of integers with n elements, where the first n-2 elements are 0, the second last element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the sum of all the original values of the first n-2 elements, and the last element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the sum of all the original values of the first n-1 elements, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and is at least 3, i is n-2
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list remains unchanged with the first n-2 elements being 0, the second last element being greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus the sum of all the original values of the first n-2 elements, and the last element being greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus the sum of all the original values of the first n-1 elements. The value of n remains the same, equal to the length of the list and at least 3, and i remains n-2. Additionally, if the function func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies a list of integers by iteratively subtracting values from the first n-2 elements and the last two elements, based on certain conditions, and then checks the modified list using another function func_1. If func_1 returns True, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the input list and prints a message.
