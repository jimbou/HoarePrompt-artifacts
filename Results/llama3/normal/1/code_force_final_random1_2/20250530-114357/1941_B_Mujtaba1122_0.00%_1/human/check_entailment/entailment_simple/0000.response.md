Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 checks if the first n elements of a list are zero, and returns True if they are, and False otherwise. func_2 applies the operation to the list until the first n-2 elements are zero, and then checks if the remaining two elements can be made zero using the operation.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of func_2. In the while loop, the program subtracts 1 times the value of the element at index i-1 from the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1. This is incorrect, as the problem statement specifies that 1 should be subtracted from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and 2 should be subtracted from the element at index i.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the first element of the list is zero. In this case, the program will incorrectly print 'YES' even if it is not possible to make all elements of the list zero using the operation.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
