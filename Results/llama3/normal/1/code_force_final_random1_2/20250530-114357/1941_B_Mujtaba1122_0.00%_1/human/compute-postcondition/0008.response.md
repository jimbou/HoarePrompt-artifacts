According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 3. The list and its elements are not in the loop head, so their state cannot be adjusted.

State: **list is a list of integers with at least three elements, where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the original value of the first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the first element, and the rest of the elements are unchanged, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and is at least 3, i is 2**
