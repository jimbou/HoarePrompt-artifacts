Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `list` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `list` and `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1
Code of the loop:
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
    list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
    list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: list is a list of integers with at least three elements, where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1, the third element is greater than 0, and the rest of the elements are unchanged, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and is at least 3, i is 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: list is a list of integers with at least four elements, where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the original value of the first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is unchanged, and the rest of the elements are unchanged, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and is at least 4, i is 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: list is a list of integers with at least four elements, where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the original value of the first element minus 2 times the original value of the first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the first element minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the first element, and the rest of the elements are unchanged, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and is at least 4, i is 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
