To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3. Since `n` is already given as a positive integer equal to the length of `list`, we can adjust the state of `n` to be at least 3. Additionally, since the loop starts from 1, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 1.

State: **`list` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `list` and `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1**
