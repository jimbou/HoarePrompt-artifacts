Correctness: **False**

Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation allows Rudolf to choose an index `i` and assign `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`, `a_i = a_i - 2`, and `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`. However, in the function `func_2`, the assignment `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` is incorrect. It should be `list[i] -= 2` instead.

Additionally, the function `func_2` only checks if the first `n-2` elements are zero after the operation, but it does not check if the last two elements are zero. The function `func_1` only checks if the first `n` elements are zero, but it does not consider the case where the last two elements are not zero.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description.
