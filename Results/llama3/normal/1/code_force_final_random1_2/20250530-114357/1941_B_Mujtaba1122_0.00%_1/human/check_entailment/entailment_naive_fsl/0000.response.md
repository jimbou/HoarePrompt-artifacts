Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input list [1, 2, 7, 2] with n = 4. The program will output 'NO', but it is actually possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the current element is greater than 1 and the adjacent elements are greater than 0 before applying the operation. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that the operation can be applied. The program should also check if the current element is even and the adjacent elements are odd before applying the operation.

Additionally, the program uses a while loop to apply the operation, which can lead to an infinite loop if the current element is not reduced to 0 or 1 after the operation. A more correct approach would be to use a for loop to iterate over the list and apply the operation only if the conditions are met.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the described operations and does not work for all potential cases.
