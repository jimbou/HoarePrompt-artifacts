Output State: **list is a list of integers with at least four elements, where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the original value of the first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is unchanged, and the rest of the elements are unchanged, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and is at least 4, i is 1**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list has at least four elements. The first element is 0. The second element is greater than 1 and is equal to its original value minus 2 times the original value of the first element. The third element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the first element. The fourth element is greater than 0 and is unchanged. The rest of the elements are unchanged. The value of n is a positive integer equal to the length of the list and is at least 4. The value of i is 1.
