The code snippet modifies the list and does not affect the variable `n`. The first line sets the value of `list[i - 1]` to 0, because any number multiplied by 0 is 0. The second line subtracts twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, but since `list[i - 1]` is now 0, `list[i]` remains unchanged. The third line subtracts the value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`, but again, since `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1]` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **list is a list of integers with at least three elements, where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1, the third element is greater than 0, and the rest of the elements are unchanged, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and is at least 3, i is 1**
