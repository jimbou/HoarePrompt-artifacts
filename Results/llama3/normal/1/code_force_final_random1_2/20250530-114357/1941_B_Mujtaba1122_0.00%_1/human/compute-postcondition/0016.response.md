To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **list is a list of integers with at least four elements, where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the second element, the fifth element is equal to its original value minus the original value of the third element, the rest of the elements are unchanged, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and is at least 4, i is 3**
