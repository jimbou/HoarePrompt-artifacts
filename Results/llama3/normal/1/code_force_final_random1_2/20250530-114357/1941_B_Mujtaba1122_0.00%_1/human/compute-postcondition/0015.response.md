Output State: **list is a list of integers with at least four elements, where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the second element, the fifth element is equal to its original value minus the original value of the third element, the rest of the elements are unchanged, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and is at least 4, i is 2**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers with at least four elements. The first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus the original value of the second element, the fifth element is equal to its original value minus the original value of the third element, and the rest of the elements are unchanged. The length of the list, n, is a positive integer and is at least 4, and the index i is 2.
