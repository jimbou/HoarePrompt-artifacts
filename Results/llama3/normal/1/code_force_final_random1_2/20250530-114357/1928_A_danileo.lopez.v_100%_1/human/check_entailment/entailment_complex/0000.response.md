Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be cut into two equal parts and then rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The program first checks if either the width (a) or the height (b) of the rectangle is even. If either of them is even, it calculates the half of the even dimension and checks if it is equal to the other dimension. If it is not equal, it prints 'Yes', indicating that the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle. If the half of the even dimension is equal to the other dimension, it prints 'No', indicating that the rectangle cannot be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle.

If both the width and the height are odd, the program prints 'No', because an odd number cannot be divided evenly into two equal parts.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
