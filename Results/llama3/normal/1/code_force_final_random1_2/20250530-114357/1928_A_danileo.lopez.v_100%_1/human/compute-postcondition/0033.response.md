Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains no input. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, 'Yes' has been printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
