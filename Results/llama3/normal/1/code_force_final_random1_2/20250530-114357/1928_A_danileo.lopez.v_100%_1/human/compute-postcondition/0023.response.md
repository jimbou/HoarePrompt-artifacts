Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'No' exactly t-1 times, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The values of a and b are not relevant to the print statement, as they are not used in the print statement. The print statement simply prints the string 'No'.

Output: **'No' (printed t-1 times, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4)**
