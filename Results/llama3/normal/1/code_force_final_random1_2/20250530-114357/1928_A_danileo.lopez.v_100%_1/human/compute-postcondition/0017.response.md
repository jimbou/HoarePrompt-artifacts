Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`, `a1` is half of `a`, `a2` is half of `a`, `a1` is not equal to `b1`, 'Yes' is printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `b1`, `b2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain the same. The program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop, and 'Yes' is still printed. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b.
