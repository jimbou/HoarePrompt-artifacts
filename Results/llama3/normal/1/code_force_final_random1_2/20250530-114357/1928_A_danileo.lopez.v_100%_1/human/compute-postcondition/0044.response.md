Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 1. If `a` or `b` is even, then if `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `a` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'No' is printed.***
