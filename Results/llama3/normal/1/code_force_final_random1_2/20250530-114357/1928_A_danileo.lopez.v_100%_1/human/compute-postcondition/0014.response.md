Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of `b` is even. `a` is even, `a1` is half of `a` and `a2` is half of `a`. The current value of `a1` is not equal to `b1`.**
