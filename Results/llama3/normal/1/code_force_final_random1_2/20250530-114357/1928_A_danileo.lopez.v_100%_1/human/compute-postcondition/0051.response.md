Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a1` is equal to `a // 2`, `a2` is equal to `a // 2`, `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains no input. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, 'Yes' is printed and we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements.***
