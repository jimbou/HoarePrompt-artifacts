Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. We skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged. The values of `a1` and `a2` are still dependent on whether `a` is even or not. The program skips to the next iteration of the loop, meaning it will continue executing the next iteration without executing any further code in the current iteration.
