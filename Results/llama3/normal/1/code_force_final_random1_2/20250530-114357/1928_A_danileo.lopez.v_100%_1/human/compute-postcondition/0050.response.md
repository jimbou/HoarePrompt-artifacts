Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a1` is equal to `a // 2`, `a2` is equal to `a // 2`, `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains no input, 'Yes' is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `t`, `a1`, `a2`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged, and 'Yes' is still being printed.
