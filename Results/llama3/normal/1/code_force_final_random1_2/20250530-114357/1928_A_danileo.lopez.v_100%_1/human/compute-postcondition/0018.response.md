Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`. If `a` is even and `a1` is not equal to `b1`, 'Yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
