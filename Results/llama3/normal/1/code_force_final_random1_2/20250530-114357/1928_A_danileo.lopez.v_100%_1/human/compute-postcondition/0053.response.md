Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`, if `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`, if `a1` is not equal to `b`, 'Yes' is printed and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. The new variables `b1` and `b2` are introduced and assigned the value of `b // 2`. The conditions related to `a` being even and the comparison between `a1` and `b` are still valid, and the program's behavior regarding printing 'Yes' and moving to the next iteration of the loop remains the same.
