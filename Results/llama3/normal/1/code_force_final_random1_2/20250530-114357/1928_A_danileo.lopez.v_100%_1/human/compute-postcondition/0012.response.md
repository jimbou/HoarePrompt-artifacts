Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, then `a1` is half of `a` and `a2` is half of `a`. If `a1` is equal to `b`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. If `a` is odd, then the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. The current value of `b` is even.***
