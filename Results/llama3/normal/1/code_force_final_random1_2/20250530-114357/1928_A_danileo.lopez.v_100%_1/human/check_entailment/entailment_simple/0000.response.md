Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If either `a` or `b` is even, the program checks if the other dimension is equal to half of the even dimension. If not, it prints "Yes" because Bob can obtain another rectangle by cutting the even dimension in half.

2. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints "No" because Bob cannot obtain another rectangle by cutting the odd dimensions.

3. If both `a` and `b` are even, the program checks if they are equal. If not, it prints "Yes" because Bob can obtain another rectangle by cutting one of the even dimensions in half. If they are equal, it prints "No" because Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
