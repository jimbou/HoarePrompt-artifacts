Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 2. If `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. If `b` is odd, the program continues to execute, and 'No' is printed**
