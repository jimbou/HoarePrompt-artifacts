Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least one of `a` or `b` is even, `_` is 0, `a1` is half of `a`, `a2` is half of `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If the current value of `a1` is equal to `b`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop.***
