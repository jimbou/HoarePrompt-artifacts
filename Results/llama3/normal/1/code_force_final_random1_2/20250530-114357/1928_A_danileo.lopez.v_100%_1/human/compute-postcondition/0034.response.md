Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, 'Yes' has been printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. The new variables `b1` and `b2` are assigned the value of `b // 2`, which is the integer division of `b` by 2. The conditions related to `a` being even and the comparison of `a1` and `b` are still valid, and the corresponding actions are taken accordingly.
