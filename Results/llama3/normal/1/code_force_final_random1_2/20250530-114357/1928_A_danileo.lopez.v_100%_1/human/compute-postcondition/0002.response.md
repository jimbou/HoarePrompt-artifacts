Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the first pair of integers from the input, and the stdin now contains one less line. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `_` is still 0.
