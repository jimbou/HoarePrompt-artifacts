Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a1` is equal to `a // 2`, `a2` is equal to `a // 2`, `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains no input, 'Yes' has been printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a1`, `a2`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input, and 'Yes' has been printed. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
