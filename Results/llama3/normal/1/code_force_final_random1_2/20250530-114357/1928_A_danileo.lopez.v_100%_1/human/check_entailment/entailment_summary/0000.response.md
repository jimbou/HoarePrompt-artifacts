Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be cut into two equal parts and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The program checks if either the length or width of the rectangle is even, and if so, it checks if the resulting half is equal to the other dimension. If it is, it prints 'No', indicating that the rectangle cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle. If neither the length nor width is even, or if the resulting half is not equal to the other dimension, it prints 'Yes', indicating that the rectangle can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the length and width are both odd, both even, or one is odd and the other is even. It also correctly handles the case when the length and width are equal.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the program produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
