Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least one of `a` or `b` is even, `_` is 0, `a1` is half of `a`, `a2` is half of `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is still an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is still an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least one of `a` or `b` is even, `_` is still 0, `a1` and `a2` are assigned the value of half of `a`, and stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
