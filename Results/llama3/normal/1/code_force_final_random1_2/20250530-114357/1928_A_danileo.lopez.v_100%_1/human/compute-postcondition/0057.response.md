Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`, if `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
