Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two integers input from stdin, which are split by a space. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `_` is still 1. Since the input from stdin has been consumed, stdin now contains no input.
