Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`, if `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`, we move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged. The condition for `a1` and `a2` is still valid, but their values are not updated. The program moves to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the current iteration.
