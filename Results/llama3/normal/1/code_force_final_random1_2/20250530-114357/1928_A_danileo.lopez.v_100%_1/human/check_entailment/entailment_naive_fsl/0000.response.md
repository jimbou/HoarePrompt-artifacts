Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program will print 'No', but actually, Bob can cut the 3x3 rectangle into two 1x3 rectangles and then form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x3 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the width or height of the rectangle is even, and if so, it checks if the other dimension is equal to half of the even dimension. However, this is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The program does not consider the case where the width and height are both odd, and it does not check all possible ways to cut the rectangle.

To fix this, the program should check all possible ways to cut the rectangle, not just the cases where the width or height is even. It should also consider the case where the width and height are both odd.
