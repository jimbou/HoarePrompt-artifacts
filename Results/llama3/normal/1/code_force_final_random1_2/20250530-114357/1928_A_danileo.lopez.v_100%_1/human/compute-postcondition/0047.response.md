Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a1` is equal to `a // 2`, `a2` is equal to `a // 2`, `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `a1` and `a2` are assigned the value of `a` divided by 2, which means they will have the same value. The value of `a` is still an integer, but its specific value is not changed by the code. The stdin still contains no input.
