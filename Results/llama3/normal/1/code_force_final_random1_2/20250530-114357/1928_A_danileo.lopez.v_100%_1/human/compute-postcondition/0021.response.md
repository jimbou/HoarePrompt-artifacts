Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0. If `b` is even, then `b1` and `b2` are half of `b`. If `a` is even and `a1` is not equal to `b1`, 'Yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `b` is odd, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. and 'No' is printed**
