Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The values of `a` and `b` are now integers, as they were assigned the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which converts the input to integers. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
