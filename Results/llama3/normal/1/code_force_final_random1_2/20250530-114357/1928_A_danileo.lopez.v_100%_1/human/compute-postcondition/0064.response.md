Output State: **`_` is `t`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).**

The loop has executed all its iterations. The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The values of `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), as they were in the initial state. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.
