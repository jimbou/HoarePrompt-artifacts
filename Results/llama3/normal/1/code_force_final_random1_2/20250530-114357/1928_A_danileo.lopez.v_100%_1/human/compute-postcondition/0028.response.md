Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a1` is equal to `a // 2`, `a2` is equal to `a // 2`, `a` and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the values of `a1` and `a2` are calculated by performing integer division of `a` by 2. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. Since there is no input in stdin, it remains empty.
