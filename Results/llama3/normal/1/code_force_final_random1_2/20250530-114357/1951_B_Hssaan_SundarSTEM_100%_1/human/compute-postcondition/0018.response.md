Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and has at least 4 elements, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s` and the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the third element of `s`, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s` but not less than the third element of `s`, `ans` is 2 if the kth element of the original list `s` is not less than the second element of `s` but less than the fourth element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 3, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the fourth element of `s`.**
