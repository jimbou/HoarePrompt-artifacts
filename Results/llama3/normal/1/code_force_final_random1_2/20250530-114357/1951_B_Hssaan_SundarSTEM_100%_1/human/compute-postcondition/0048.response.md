Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `z` is 1, `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 1. Since `z` is now 1, the value of `ans1` is updated to 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
