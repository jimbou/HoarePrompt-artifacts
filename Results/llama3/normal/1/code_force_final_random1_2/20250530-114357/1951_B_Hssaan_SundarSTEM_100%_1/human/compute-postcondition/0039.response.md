Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `z` is 1, `ans1` is either 1 or not updated.**

The code only updates the value of `z` to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `ans1` is either 1 or not updated, depending on whether `s[0]` is equal to `h`.
