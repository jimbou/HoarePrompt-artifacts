Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 2
1000000000 1

The program will output:

1
2
0

However, the correct output should be:

1
2
1

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when the cow's rating is the highest among all cows. In this case, the program should output 1, but it outputs 0. This is because the program does not correctly update the `ans` variable when the cow's rating is the highest.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly handle the case when the cow's rating is the highest among all cows. One possible solution is to add a condition to check if the cow's rating is the highest, and if so, set `ans` to 1.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math as m

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])
        ans = 0
        h = s[0]
        j = -1
        for i in s[1:]:
            j += 1
            if h < i:
                break
            else:
                ans += 1
        p = j + 1
        (s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])
        ans1 = 0
        (s[p], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[p])
        z = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        if h == max(s):
            ans = 1
        print(max(ans, ans1))
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all cases.
