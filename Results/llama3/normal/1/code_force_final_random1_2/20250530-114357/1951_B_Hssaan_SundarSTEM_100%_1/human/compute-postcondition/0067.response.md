Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and appear after the first element in `s`, `z` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, `p`, `ans1`, and `z` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `j` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1.
