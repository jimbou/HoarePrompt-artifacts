Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped twice, then its last and kth elements swapped that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `ans1` is 2 if the first element in `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and the first element in `s` is less than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 1, while the values of all other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
