Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `h`, `ans`, `ans1`, `z` are integers. `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least p+1 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s. `h` is the kth element of the original list s. `j` is p-1. `_` is 2. `stdin` is empty. `i` is the first element in the list and its current value is greater than the kth element of the original list `s`. `p` is the number of elements in s minus 1. `ans1` is 0. `z` is 0. The first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`.**
