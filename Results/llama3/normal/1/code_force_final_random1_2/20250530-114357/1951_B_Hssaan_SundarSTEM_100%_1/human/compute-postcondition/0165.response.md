Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `h`, `ans`, `z` are integers. `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least p+3 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s. `h` is the kth element of the original list s. `j` is p-1. `_` is 2. `stdin` is empty. `p` is the number of elements in s minus 1. If the first element of the list `s` is equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is 2. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is 2 if the current value of the first element of s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s and `i` is equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables keep their initial values except for `ans1`. If the first element of the list `s` is equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is increased by 1 to be 2. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is increased by 1 to be 2 regardless of whether the current value of the first element of s is equal to the kth element of the original list s or not, and regardless of whether `i` is equal to `h` or not.
