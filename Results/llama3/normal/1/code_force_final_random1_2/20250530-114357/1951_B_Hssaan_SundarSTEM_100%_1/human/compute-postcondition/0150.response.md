Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `h`, `ans`, `ans1`, `z` are integers. `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least p+1 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s. `h` is the kth element of the original list s. `j` is p-1. `_` is 2. `stdin` is empty. `p` is the number of elements in s minus 1. If the first element of the list `s` is equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is 1 if the current value of the first element of s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s, otherwise `ans1` is 0, and `z` is 1. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0.**
