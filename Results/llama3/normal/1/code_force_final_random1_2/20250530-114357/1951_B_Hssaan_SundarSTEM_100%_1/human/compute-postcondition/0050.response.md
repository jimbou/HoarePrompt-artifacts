Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `z` is 1, `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1 and `i` is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, `p`, and `z` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `ans1`, which is now 1 if `z` is 1 and `i` is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0.
