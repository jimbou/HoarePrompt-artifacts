Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is -1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, p is 0, ans1 is the number of elements in s that are equal to the kth element of the original list s and appear after the first element in s, z is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and appear after the first element in `s`, `z` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is greater than or equal to the third element in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and appear after the first element in `s`, `z` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the third element in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least 4 elements. If the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the fourth element in `s`, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If the kth element of the original list `s` is greater than or equal to the fourth element in `s`, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if the kth element of the original list `s` is greater than or equal to the fourth element in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
