Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans` will hold the count of elements in the list `s` that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`. The variable `j` will hold the index of the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`. The variable `i` will hold the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
