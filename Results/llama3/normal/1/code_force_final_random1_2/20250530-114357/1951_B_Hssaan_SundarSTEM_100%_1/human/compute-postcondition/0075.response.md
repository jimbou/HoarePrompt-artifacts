Postcondition: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least 4 elements. If the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the fourth element in `s`, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If the kth element of the original list `s` is greater than or equal to the fourth element in `s`, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if the kth element of the original list `s` is greater than or equal to the fourth element in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 3.**
