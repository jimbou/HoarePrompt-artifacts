Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0, and `i` is not equal to `h`. The current value of `i` is greater than the current value of `h`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
