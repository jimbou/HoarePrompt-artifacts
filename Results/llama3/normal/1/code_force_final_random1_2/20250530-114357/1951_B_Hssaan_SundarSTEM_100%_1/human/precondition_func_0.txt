stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers: the number of cows (n) and the index of the cow of interest (k). The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and the Cowdeforces ratings are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
