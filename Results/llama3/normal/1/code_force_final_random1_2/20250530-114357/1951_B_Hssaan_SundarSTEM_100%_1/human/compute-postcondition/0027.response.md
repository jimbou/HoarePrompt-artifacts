Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 1 element, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the index of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the first element in s, p is j + 1, ans1 is 0, z is 0, and i is not equal to h.**
