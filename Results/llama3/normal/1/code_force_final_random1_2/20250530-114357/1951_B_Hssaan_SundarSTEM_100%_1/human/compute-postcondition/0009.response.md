State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and has at least 3 elements, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third element of `s`.**
