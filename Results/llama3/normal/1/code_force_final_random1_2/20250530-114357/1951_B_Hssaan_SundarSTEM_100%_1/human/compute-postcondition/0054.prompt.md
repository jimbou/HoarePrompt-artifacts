Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the index of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, p is j + 1, ans1 is 0, z is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 1 element, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the index of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the first element in s, p is j + 1, ans1 is 0 or 1, z is 1. If the current value of i is equal to the current value of h, ans1 is 0. Otherwise, if i is less than or equal to h, ans1 is 0. If i is greater than h, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 2 elements, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the index of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the second element in s, p is j + 1, z is 1. If the current value of i is equal to the current value of h, ans1 is 0 or not updated. If i is greater than h, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and ans1 is 0. If i is less than or equal to h, ans1 is 1 if z is 1, otherwise there is no change in ans1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 3 elements, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the index of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the third element in s, p is j + 1, z is 1. If i is greater than h, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and ans1 is 0. If i is less than or equal to h, ans1 is 1 if z is 1, otherwise there is no change in ans1. If i is equal to h, ans1 is 0 or not updated. If the first element of s is not equal to h, ans1 is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
