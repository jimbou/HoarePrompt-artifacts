Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans1` is 0. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise there is no change in `ans1`.***
