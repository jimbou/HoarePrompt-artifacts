Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and has at least 4 elements, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s` and the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the third element of `s`, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s` but not less than the third element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the fourth element of `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
