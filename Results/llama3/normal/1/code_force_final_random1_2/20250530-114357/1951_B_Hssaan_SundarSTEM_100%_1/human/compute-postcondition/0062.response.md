Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the last element in `s` that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and appear after the first element in `s`, `z` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
