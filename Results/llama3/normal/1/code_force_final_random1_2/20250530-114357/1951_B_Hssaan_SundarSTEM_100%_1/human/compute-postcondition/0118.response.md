Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than the kth element of the original list `s` plus 1 if the first element in `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and the first element in `s` is less than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than the kth element of the original list `s`, `z` is 1 if the first element in `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and the first element in `s` is less than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `z` is not 1**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.
