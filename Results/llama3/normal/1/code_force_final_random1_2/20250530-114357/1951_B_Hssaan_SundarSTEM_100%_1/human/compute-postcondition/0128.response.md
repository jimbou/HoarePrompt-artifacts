Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, `p`, `ans1`, `z` are integers or lists or variables as described in the precondition. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 2. In both cases, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least 3 elements, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than the kth element of the original list `s` plus 1 if the first element in `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and the first element in `s` is less than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than the kth element of the original list `s`, `z` is 1 if the first element in `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and the first element in `s` is less than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `z` is not 1.***
