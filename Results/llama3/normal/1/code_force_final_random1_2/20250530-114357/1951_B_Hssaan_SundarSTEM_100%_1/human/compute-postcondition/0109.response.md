Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p` are integers or lists of integers with certain properties. If `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 3 if the first element in `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and the first element in `s` is less than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans1` is 2. If `z` is not 1, then `ans1` is 2 if the first element in `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s` and the first element in `s` is less than or equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If the first element in `s` is greater than the kth element of the original list `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
