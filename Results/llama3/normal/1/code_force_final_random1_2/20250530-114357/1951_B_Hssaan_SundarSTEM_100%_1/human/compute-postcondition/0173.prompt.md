Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers: the number of cows (n) and the index of the cow of interest (k). The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and the Cowdeforces ratings are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j + 1
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the index of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, p is j + 1, ans1 is the number of elements in s that are equal to the kth element of the original list s and appear after the first element in s, z is 1, and the maximum of ans and ans1 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped twice, then its last and kth elements swapped, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the number of elements in s minus 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, p is the number of elements in s minus 1, ans1 is the number of elements in s that are less than the kth element of the original list s plus 1 if the first element in s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s and the first element in s is less than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, otherwise ans1 is the number of elements in s that are less than the kth element of the original list s, z is 1 if the first element in s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s and the first element in s is less than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, otherwise z is not 1, and the maximum of ans and ans1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k`, `p`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `h`, `ans`, `z` are integers. `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least p+1 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s. `h` is the kth element of the original list s. `j` is p-1. `_` is 2. `stdin` is empty. `p` is the number of elements in s minus 1. `ans1` is the number of elements in s that are equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the left of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s. `z` is 1., and the maximum value between the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s and the number of elements in s that are equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the left of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
