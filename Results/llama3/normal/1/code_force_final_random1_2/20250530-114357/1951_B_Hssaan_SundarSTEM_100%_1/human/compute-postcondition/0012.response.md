Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and has at least 3 elements, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third element of `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, then `ans` is now 1, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
