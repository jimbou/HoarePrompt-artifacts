Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and has at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the second element of `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their original values, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
