Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least p+1 elements, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is p-1, _ is 2, stdin is empty, i is the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, p is the number of elements in s minus 1, ans1 is 0, z is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `k`, `p`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `h`, `ans`, `ans1`, `z` are integers. `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least p+1 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s. `h` is the kth element of the original list s. `j` is p-1. `_` is 2. `stdin` is empty. `p` is the number of elements in s minus 1. If the first element of the list `s` is equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is 1 if the current value of the first element of s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s, otherwise `ans1` is 0, and `z` is 1. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `p`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `h`, `ans`, `ans1`, `z` are integers. `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least p+2 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s. `h` is the kth element of the original list s. `j` is p-1. `_` is 2. `stdin` is empty. `p` is the number of elements in s minus 1. If the first element of the list `s` is equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is 1 if the current value of the first element of s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s, otherwise `ans1` is 0, and `z` is 1. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 2 if `i` is equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `z` is 0, `ans1` is 1. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is 2 if the current value of the first element of s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s and `i` is equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1, and `z` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `p`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `h`, `ans`, `z` are integers. `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least p+3 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s. `h` is the kth element of the original list s. `j` is p-1. `_` is 2. `stdin` is empty. `p` is the number of elements in s minus 1. If the first element of the list `s` is equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is 1 if the current value of the first element of s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s, otherwise `ans1` is 0, and `z` is 1. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 2 if `i` is equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `z` is 0, `ans1` is 1. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then `ans1` is 2 if the current value of the first element of s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s and `i` is equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1, and `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 2. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2. Otherwise, `ans1` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
