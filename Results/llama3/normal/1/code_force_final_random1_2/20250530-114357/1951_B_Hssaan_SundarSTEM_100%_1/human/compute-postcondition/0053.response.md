Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped that must have at least 3 elements, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the index of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the third element in s, p is j + 1, z is 1. If i is greater than h, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and ans1 is 0. If i is less than or equal to h, ans1 is 1 if z is 1, otherwise there is no change in ans1. If i is equal to h, ans1 is 0 or not updated. If the first element of s is not equal to h, ans1 is 1.**
