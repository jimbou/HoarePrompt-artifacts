Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is -1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and has at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the second element of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and has at least 3 elements, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s` and the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the third element of `s`, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s` but not less than the third element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the third element of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and has at least 4 elements, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s` and the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the third element of `s`, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s` but not less than the third element of `s`, `ans` is 2 if the kth element of the original list `s` is not less than the second element of `s` but less than the fourth element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 3, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the fourth element of `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
