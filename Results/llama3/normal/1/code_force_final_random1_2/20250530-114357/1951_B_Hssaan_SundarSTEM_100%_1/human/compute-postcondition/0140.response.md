Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped and must have at least p+1 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s and are to the right of the kth element in the original list s, `h` is the kth element of the original list s, `j` is p-1, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element in the list and is equal to the kth element of the original list s, `p` is the number of elements in s minus 1, `ans1` is 1 if the current value of the first element of s is not equal to the kth element of the original list s, otherwise `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0.***
