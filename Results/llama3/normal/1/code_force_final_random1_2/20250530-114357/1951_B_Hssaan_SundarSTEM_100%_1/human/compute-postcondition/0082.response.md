Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with its first and `k`th elements swapped twice, then its last and `k`th elements swapped that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 0. The current value of `i` is not equal to the current value of `h`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans1` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
