State: **n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with its first and kth elements swapped, ans is the number of elements in s that are greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the index of the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: a space-separated list of two integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is the last element in s that is greater than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, p is j + 1, ans1 is the number of elements in s that are equal to the kth element of the original list s and appear after the first element in s, z is 1, and the maximum of ans and ans1 is printed**
