Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers: the number of cows (n) and the index of the cow of interest (k). The second line contains n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. For each test case, the function swaps the Cowdeforces rating of the cow of interest with the first cow, then calculates the number of cows that have a lower or equal rating than the cow of interest. It then swaps the Cowdeforces rating of the cow of interest with the cow at the position where the previous swap was made, and calculates the number of cows that have a lower or equal rating than the cow of interest again. Finally, the function prints the maximum of these two calculations. The function repeats this process for all test cases.**
