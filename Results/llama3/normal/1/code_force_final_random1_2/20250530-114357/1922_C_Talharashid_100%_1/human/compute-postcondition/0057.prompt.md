Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `1`, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` if the difference between the `i + 2`th and `i + 1`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary where `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` is an integer and `stdin` contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program prints the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it prints the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. The values of `n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The values of `n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. `x` and `y` are assigned the values of two integers from the input. `stdin` now contains no input. `j` is increased by 1. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, and `m` remain unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `x` and `y` are assigned new integer values, `m` is greater than the new value of `j`, and `stdin` now contains no input. If `y` > `x`, the difference between the values of `d1` at the new indices `y` and `x` is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
