To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 2, because the loop starts from `n - 2` and goes down to 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` if the difference between the `i + 2`th and `i + 1`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
