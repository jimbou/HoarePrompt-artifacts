Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, stdin is empty. The difference between the elements at indices `i` and `i - 1` in `l` is larger than or equal to the difference between the elements at indices `i + 1` and `i` in `l`***
