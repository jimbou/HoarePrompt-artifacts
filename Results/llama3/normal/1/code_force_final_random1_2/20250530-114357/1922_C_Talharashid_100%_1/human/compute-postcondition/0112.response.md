The code prints the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`. Since `y` is greater than `x`, the program has already printed the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x`. Now, it prints the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`. The values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` are determined by the differences between consecutive elements of the list `l` and the updates made to `d2` based on these differences.

Output: **the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` (where `y` and `x` are integers read from the input and `d2` is a defaultdict updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of the list `l`)**
