Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is an empty list, d1 is a defaultdict with d1[2] = 1, d2 is an empty defaultdict, j is equal to m, x and y are not assigned, i is 0, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
        d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
    else:
        d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `l` is a list with at least three elements, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, `d2` is an empty defaultdict, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are not assigned, and `stdin` is empty. Specifically, if the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1[3] = 1 + d1[2]`. Otherwise, `d1[3] = l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `l` is a list with at least three elements, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`. If the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1[4] = 1 + d1[3]`. Otherwise, `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`. `d2` is an empty defaultdict, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are not assigned, and `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `l` is a list with at least three elements, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`. If the difference between the fourth and third elements of `l` is less than the difference between the third and second elements of `l`, then `d1[5] = 1 + d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[5]` is updated based on the difference between the fourth and third elements of `l` and the value of `d1[4]`. `d2` is an empty defaultdict, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are not assigned, and `stdin` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
