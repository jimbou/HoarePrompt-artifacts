Output: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `l` is a list with at least `n` elements, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` and the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l` for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`), `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated based on the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` and the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l` for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`), `j` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `x` and `y` are integers, stdin is empty, and the program has printed the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it has printed the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`, and the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` is printed.**
