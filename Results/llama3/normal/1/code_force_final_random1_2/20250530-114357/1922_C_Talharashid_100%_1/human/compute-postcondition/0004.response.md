Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2 and `i + 2` and values 1 and 1 + `d1[i + 1]` respectively, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 1, and `l` is still a list of integers. The dictionary `d1` now has two keys: 2 and `i + 2` (which is 3), with values 1 and 1 + `d1[i + 1]` respectively. The dictionary `d2` is still empty, and `stdin` is still empty. The condition that the current value of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is still true.
