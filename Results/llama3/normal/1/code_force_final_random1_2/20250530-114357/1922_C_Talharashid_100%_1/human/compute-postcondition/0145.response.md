Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[n - 4] = 1 + d2[n - 3]`, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is at least 4. The list `l` also remains unchanged. The defaultdict `d1` remains the same with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`. The defaultdict `d2` is updated with `d2[n - 4] = 1 + d2[n - 3]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `x`, `y`, and `m` remain the same. The stdin is still empty.
