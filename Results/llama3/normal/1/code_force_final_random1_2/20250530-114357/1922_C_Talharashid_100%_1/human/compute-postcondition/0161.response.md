To determine what will be printed when the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` executes, let's break down the initial state and the conditions that affect the values of `d1`, `x`, and `y`.

1. **Initial State of `d1`**: `d1` is a defaultdict with an initial value of `d1[2] = 1`. It is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`. This means `d1` will have values for indices from 3 to `n` (since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n - 1`, and `i + 2` is used as the key), depending on the differences between consecutive elements in list `l`.

2. **Values of `x` and `y`**: `x` and `y` are integers from the input. However, the problem statement specifies that stdin contains no input. This implies that `x` and `y` cannot be directly determined from the given information because there is no input provided to assign values to `x` and `y`.

Given the above points, we cannot precisely determine the values of `x` and `y` because they are supposed to come from an input that is stated to be nonexistent. However, we can describe what the print statement is intended to do:

- It is supposed to print the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x`. These indices are determined by input values `x` and `y`, which are not provided.

Since `x` and `y` are not defined due to the lack of input, and assuming the code would execute without errors (which might not be the case due to the missing input), the precise numerical output cannot be determined.

However, following the required format and providing a description based on the given conditions:

Output: **The difference between the value of d1 at index y and the value of d1 at index x, where y and x are undefined due to missing input.**
