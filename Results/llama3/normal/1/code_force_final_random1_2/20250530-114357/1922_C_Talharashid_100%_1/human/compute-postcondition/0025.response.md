Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` if the difference between the `i + 2`th and `i + 1`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary where `d2[n - 1]` is 1 and `d2[i]` is 1 plus `d2[i + 1]`. `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still `n - 3`, and `l` is still a list of integers. The dictionary `d1` remains unchanged. The dictionary `d2` has been updated such that `d2[i]` is now 1 plus `d2[i + 1]`. The stdin is still empty.
