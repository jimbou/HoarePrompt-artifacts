To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). Also, `i` should be initialized to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with key 2 and value 1, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty**
