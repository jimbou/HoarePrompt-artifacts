Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another. It first creates two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative distances from the first city to each city and from each city to the last city, respectively. The dictionaries are populated based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

The program then reads the queries and calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the source city to the destination city. If the destination city is to the right of the source city, it uses the `d1` dictionary to calculate the cumulative distance. If the destination city is to the left of the source city, it uses the `d2` dictionary to calculate the cumulative distance.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the source and destination cities are the same, or when the source city is the first city and the destination city is the last city.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
