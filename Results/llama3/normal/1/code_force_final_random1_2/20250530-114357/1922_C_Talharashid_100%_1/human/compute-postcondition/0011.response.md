Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the third and second elements of `l` is less than the difference between the second and first elements of `l`, then `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.***
