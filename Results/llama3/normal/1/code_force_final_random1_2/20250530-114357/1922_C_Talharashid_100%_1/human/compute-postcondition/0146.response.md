Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[n - 4] = l[n - 4] - l[n - 5] + d2[n - 3]`, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[n - 4]` has been updated based on the condition `l[n - 4] - l[n - 5] + d2[n - 3]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
