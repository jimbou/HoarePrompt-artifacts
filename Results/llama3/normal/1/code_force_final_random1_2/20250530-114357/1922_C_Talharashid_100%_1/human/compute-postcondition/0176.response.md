Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of unique integers in ascending order, another integer, and multiple pairs of unique integers. It then calculates and prints the differences between the values of two dictionaries (`d1` and `d2`) at the indices specified by the pairs of integers, depending on whether the second index is greater than the first index. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, leaving the input variables unchanged and the standard input empty.**
