Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, `d1[4]` is updated based on the difference between the third and second elements of `l` and the value of `d1[3]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 2. The list `l` remains unchanged. The defaultdict `d1` has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is `4` and the value is the difference between the third and second elements of `l` plus the value of `d1[3]`. The defaultdict `d2` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `j`, `x`, `y`, and `m` remain the same. The stdin remains empty.
