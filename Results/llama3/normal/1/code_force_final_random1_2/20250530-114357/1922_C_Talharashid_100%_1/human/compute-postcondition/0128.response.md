State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, `d1[4]` is updated based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, `i` is 3, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, `stdin` is empty.**
