#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then multiple pairs of unique integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The list of integers are non-negative integers. The second integer is a positive integer and less than or equal to the length of the list. The pairs of integers are positive integers and less than or equal to the length of the list.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        d1 = defaultdict(int)
        
        d2 = defaultdict(int)
        
        d1[2] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
        
        d2[n - 1] = 1
        
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
                d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
            else:
                d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
        
        m = int(input())
        
        for j in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[y] - d2[x])
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the values of `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, and `m` remain unchanged. `i` is equal to the number of test cases, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, and `stdin` contains no input. The program has printed the differences between the values of `d1` or `d2` at the indices `y` and `x` for each iteration of the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of unique integers in ascending order, another integer, and multiple pairs of unique integers. It then calculates and prints the differences between the values of two dictionaries (`d1` and `d2`) at the indices specified by the pairs of integers, depending on whether the second index is greater than the first index. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, leaving the input variables unchanged and the standard input empty.
