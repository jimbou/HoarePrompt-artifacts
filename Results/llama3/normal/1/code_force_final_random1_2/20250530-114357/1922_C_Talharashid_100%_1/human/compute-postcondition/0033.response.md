Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `1`, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` if the difference between the `i + 2`th and `i + 1`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary where `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` is an integer and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2` remain the same as in the initial state. However, `m` is assigned the value of an integer from the input, but since `stdin` is empty, `m` will be assigned a default value or an error will occur. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that it contains no input.
