Postcondition: **The program prints the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it prints the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. The values of `n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains no input.**
