Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, d1 is a defaultdict with d1[2] = 1, d2 is a defaultdict with d2[n - 1] = 1, i is 2, j is m, x and y are integers, m is an integer, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
        d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
    else:
        d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`. `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1[3] = 1 + d1[2] = 2`. Otherwise, `d1[3] = l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, `d1[4]` is updated based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, `stdin` is empty. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[4] = 1 + d1[3]`. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is updated based on the difference between the third and second elements of `l` and the value of `d1[3]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, `d1[4]` is updated based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[5]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[5]` is updated based on the difference between the fourth and third elements of `l` and the value of `d1[4]`. `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, `i` is 3, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, `stdin` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
