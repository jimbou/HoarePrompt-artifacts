The code prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. Since `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the value of `d2[y]` will be greater than or equal to `d2[x]`. Therefore, the difference will be a non-negative integer.

Output: **a non-negative integer (which is the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`)**
