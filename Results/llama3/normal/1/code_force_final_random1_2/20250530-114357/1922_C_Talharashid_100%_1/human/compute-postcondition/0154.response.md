Output: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is the input from stdin and must be greater than 0, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`, and the difference between the value of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` is being printed**
