State: **n is at least 4, i is 2, l is a list with at least n elements, d1 is a defaultdict with d1[2] = 1 and d1[i + 2] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1), d2 is a defaultdict with d2[n - 1] = 1 and d2[i] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1). j is m, x and y are integers, m is an integer and stdin is empty.**
