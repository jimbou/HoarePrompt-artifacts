The code prints the difference between the value of `d1` at index `y` and the value of `d1` at index `x`. 

Since `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` if the difference between the `i + 2`th and `i + 1`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `d1[y] - d1[x]` without knowing the exact values of `l`, `x`, and `y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the value of `d1` at index `y` and the value of `d1` at index `x`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is the value of d1 at index y and d1[x] is the value of d1 at index x)**
