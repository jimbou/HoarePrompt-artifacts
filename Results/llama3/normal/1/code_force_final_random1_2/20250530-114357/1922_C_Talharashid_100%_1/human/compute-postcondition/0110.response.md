The code prints the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x`. Here, `d1` is a defaultdict that has been updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `l`. The values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` are the cumulative sums of these differences up to the `y`th and `x`th elements of `l`, respectively.

Since `y` is greater than `x`, the print statement will output the difference between the cumulative sum of differences up to the `y`th element and the cumulative sum of differences up to the `x`th element.

Output: **the difference between the cumulative sum of differences up to the yth element and the cumulative sum of differences up to the xth element of list l**
