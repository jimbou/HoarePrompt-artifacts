Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is a list of integers, d1 is a dictionary with key 2 and value 1, d2 is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty, i is at least 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` is a positive integer that was read from stdin. The list `l` contains a list of integers that were also read from stdin. The dictionary `d1` has a key-value pair where the key is 2 and the value is 1. The dictionary `d2` is empty. Stdin is empty because two lines of input were read. The value of `i` remains at least 1, as it was not modified by the code.
