To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `stdin` (since `input()` reads from `stdin`).


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has reached the end of the range, and `stdin` contains no input.


For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to the starting value of the range, and `stdin` needs to have some input.


Since `i` is the loop variable, it will be reset to the starting value of the range, which is 0.


`stdin` needs to have some input for `input()` to return a value. Let's assume that `stdin` now contains a single integer value.


State: **`n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, and `m` remain unchanged, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are not assigned, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains a single integer value**
