Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `l` is a list with at least three elements, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, `d2` is an empty defaultdict, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are not assigned, and `stdin` is empty. Specifically, if the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1[3] = 1 + d1[2]`. Otherwise, `d1[3] = l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`.***
