Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` if the difference between the `i + 2`th and `i + 1`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary where `d2[n - 1]` is 1 and `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `stdin` is empty. The difference between the `i`th and `(i - 1)`th elements of `l` is not less than the difference between the `(i + 1)`th and `i`th elements of `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, which is a specific combination of variables. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the differences between elements of `l` are still valid.
