To determine what will be printed when the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` executes, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **`n`**: An integer that must be at least 1.
2. **`l`**: A list of integers.
3. **`d1`**: A defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`. It is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`.
4. **`d2`**: A defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`. It is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`.
5. **`i`**: Equals 0.
6. **`j`**: Equals 2.
7. **`m`**: An integer that is the input from stdin and must be greater than 2.
8. **`x`**: An integer from the input.
9. **`y`**: An integer from the input.
10. **stdin**: Contains no input.

Given that `stdin` contains no input, the values of `m`, `x`, and `y` cannot be determined directly from the input as there is no input provided. However, we can infer the following based on the conditions and updates applied to `d1` and `d2`:

- The initial state of `d1` and `d2` and their update conditions are based on the list `l` and its elements' differences.
- Since `x` and `y` are integers from the input but there is no input, we cannot directly infer their values. However, we can say that `x` and `y` are supposed to be integers that would be input by the user if stdin were not empty.
- The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` calculates the difference between the values stored in `d1` at indices `y` and `x`.

Given the lack of specific values for `x` and `y` due to the absence of input, and without knowing the exact elements of list `l` or how `d1` is updated based on `l`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `d1[y] - d1[x]`.

However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **The difference between the value of `d1` at index `y` and the value of `d1` at index `x`, where `x` and `y` are integers that would have been input by the user if stdin were not empty, and `d1` values are determined by the updates based on the list `l`.**
