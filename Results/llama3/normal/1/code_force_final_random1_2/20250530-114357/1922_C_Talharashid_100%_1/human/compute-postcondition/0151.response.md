Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is the input from stdin and must be greater than 0, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `i`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers.
