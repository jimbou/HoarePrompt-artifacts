Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` if the difference between the `i + 2`th and `i + 1`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `l`, and `d1` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `d2` is no longer an empty dictionary, but now contains a key-value pair where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1. The `stdin` remains empty.
