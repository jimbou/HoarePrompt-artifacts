Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the values of `n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, and `m` remain unchanged. `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, and `stdin` contains no input. The program has printed the differences between the values of `d1` or `d2` at the indices `y` and `x` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the variables that were not affected by the loop head and body (`n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, and `m`) remain unchanged. The loop counter `j` has reached its final value `m`, and the last values of `x` and `y` are the last two integers from the input. The program has printed the required differences between the values of `d1` or `d2` at the indices `y` and `x` for each iteration of the loop.
