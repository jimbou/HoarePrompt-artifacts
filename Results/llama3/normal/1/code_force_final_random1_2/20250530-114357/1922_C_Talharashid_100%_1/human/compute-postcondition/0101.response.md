State: **n is at least 3, i is 1, l is a list with at least n elements, d1 is a defaultdict with d1[2] = 1 and d1[i + 2] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1), d2 is a defaultdict with d2[n - 1] = 1 and d2[i] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1). If the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l is less than the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l, then d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]. Otherwise, d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]. j is 1, x and y are integers, m is at least 2 and stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. The program prints the difference between the values of d1 at indices y and x if y is greater than x, otherwise it prints the difference between the values of d2 at indices y and x.**
