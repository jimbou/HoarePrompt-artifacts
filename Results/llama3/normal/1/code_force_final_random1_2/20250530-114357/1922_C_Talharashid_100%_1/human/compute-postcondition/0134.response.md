To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the range defined by `n - 2`, `0`, and the step `-1`. The loop will execute if `n - 2` is greater than `0`, which means `n` must be at least `3`.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, stdin is empty**
