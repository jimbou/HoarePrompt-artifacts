The code prints the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`.
Since the exact values of `y` and `x` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the difference. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`.
Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where y and x are integers)**
