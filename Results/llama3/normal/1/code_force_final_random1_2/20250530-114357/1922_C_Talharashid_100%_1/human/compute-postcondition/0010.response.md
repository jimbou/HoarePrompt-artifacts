Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[i + 2]` is specifically calculated as `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
