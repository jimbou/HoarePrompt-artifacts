Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` if the difference between the `i + 2`th and `i + 1`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary where `d2[n - 1]` is 1 and `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to be `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
