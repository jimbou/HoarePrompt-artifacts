Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[3] = 1 + d1[2] = 2`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, `stdin` is empty. The difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `d1` has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is `i + 2` (which is 3) and the value is `1 + d1[i + 1]` (which is 2). The other variables remain unchanged.
