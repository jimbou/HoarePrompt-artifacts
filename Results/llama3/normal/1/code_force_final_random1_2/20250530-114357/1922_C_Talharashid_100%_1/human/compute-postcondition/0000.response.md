To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the input from `stdin` is a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of the input from `stdin` to be a positive integer.

Additionally, since the loop will iterate `i` times, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be at least 1.

State: **stdin contains a positive integer, `i` is at least 1**
