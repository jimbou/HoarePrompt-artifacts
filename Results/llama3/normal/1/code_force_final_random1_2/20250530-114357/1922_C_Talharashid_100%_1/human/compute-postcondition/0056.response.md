Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, and `m` remain unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `x` and `y` are assigned new integer values, `m` is greater than the new value of `j`, and `stdin` now contains no input. If `y` > `x`, the difference between the values of `d1` at the new indices `y` and `x` is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` is being printed.***
