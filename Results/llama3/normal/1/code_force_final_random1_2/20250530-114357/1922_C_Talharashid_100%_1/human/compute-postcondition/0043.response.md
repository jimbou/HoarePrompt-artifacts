The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value and `m` is some value greater than `j`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **The program prints the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it prints the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. The values of `n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains no input, `j` is increased by 1**
