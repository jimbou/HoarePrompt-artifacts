To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4 (since `i` is now 3).

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the third and second elements of `l` is less than the difference between the second and first elements of `l`, then `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.**
