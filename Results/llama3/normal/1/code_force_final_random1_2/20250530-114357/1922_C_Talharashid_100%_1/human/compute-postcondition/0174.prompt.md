Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer that is the input from stdin, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `m` is an integer that is the input from stdin and must be greater than 0, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` is being printed. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the difference between the value of `d2` at index `y` and the value of `d2` at index `x` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer that is the input from stdin and must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains no input. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at index `y` and the value of `d1` at index `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the value of `d2` at index `y` and the value of `d2` at index `x` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is 2, `m` is an integer that is the input from stdin and must be greater than 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains no input. If `y` > `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at index `y` and the value of `d1` at index `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the value of `d2` at index `y` and the value of `d2` at index `x` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
