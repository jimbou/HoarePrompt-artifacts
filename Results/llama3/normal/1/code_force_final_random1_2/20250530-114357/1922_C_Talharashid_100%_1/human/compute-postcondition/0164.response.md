Output: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer that is the input from stdin and must be greater than 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: the difference between the value of `d2` at index `y` and the value of `d2` at index `x`**
