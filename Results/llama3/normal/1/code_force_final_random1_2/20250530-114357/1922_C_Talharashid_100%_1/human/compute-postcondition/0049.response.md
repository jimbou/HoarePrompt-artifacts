Postcondition: **The values of `n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. `x` and `y` are assigned the values of two integers from the input. `stdin` now contains no input. `j` is increased by 1. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` is printed.**
