Postcondition: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `l` is a list with at least three elements, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d1[3]` is updated based on the difference between the second and first elements of `l` and the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`. If the difference between the fourth and third elements of `l` is less than the difference between the third and second elements of `l`, then `d1[5] = 1 + d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[5]` is updated based on the difference between the fourth and third elements of `l` and the value of `d1[4]`. `d2` is an empty defaultdict, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are not assigned, and `stdin` is empty.**
