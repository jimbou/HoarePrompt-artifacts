Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer, `stdin` is empty. The difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than or equal to the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`***
