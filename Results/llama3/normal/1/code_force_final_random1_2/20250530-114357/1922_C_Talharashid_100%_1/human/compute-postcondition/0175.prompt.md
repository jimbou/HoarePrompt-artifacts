Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then multiple pairs of unique integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The list of integers are non-negative integers. The second integer is a positive integer and less than or equal to the length of the list. The pairs of integers are positive integers and less than or equal to the length of the list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    d1[2] = 1
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
            d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
        else:
            d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
    d2[n - 1] = 1
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
            d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
        else:
            d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
    m = int(input())
    for j in range(m):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if y > x:
            print(d1[y] - d1[x])
        else:
            print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has finished executing, and the values of `n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, and `m` remain unchanged. `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, and `stdin` contains no input. The program has printed the differences between the values of `d1` or `d2` at the indices `y` and `x` for each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 3, i is 1, l is a list with at least n elements, d1 is a defaultdict with d1[2] = 1 and d1[i + 2] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1), d2 is a defaultdict with d2[n - 1] = 1 and d2[i] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1). j is m, x and y are integers, m is an integer and stdin is empty. The program has printed the difference between the values of d1 at indices y and x if y is greater than x, otherwise it has printed the difference between the values of d2 at indices y and x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer that is the input from stdin and must be greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at index `y` and the value of `d1` at index `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the value of `d2` at index `y` and the value of `d2` at index `x` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
