Output: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is `1`, `l` is a list with at least `n` elements, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` and the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l` for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`), `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated based on the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` and the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l` for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`). If the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l`, then `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is at least 1 and stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`. The difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` is being printed.**
