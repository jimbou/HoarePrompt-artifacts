The code prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. 

Here, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`. 

Since `x` and `y` are integers from the input and stdin contains no input, the values of `x` and `y` are not defined. 

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values of d2[y] and d2[x] respectively)**
