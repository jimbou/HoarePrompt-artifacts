Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1` has keys 2 and `i + 2` with values 1 and 1 + `d1[i + 1]` respectively. Otherwise, `d1` has key 2 with value 1 and key 3 with value `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`.***
