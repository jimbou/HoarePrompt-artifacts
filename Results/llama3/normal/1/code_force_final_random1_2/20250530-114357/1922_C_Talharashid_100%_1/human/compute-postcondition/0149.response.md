Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`) based on the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, `i` is `0`, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are integers, `m` is an integer that is the input from stdin, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to be the integer input from stdin. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to input the value of `m`.
