The code prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. Where `d1[y]` is the value at index `y` in the list `d1` and `d1[x]` is the value at index `x` in the list `d1`. Here, `x` and `y` are assigned the values of two integers from the input.
Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is the value at index y in the list d1 and d1[x] is the value at index x in the list d1)**
