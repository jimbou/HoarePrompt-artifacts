Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least 3, `i` is `1`, `l` is a list with at least `n` elements, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` and the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l` for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`), `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated based on the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` and the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l` for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`). If the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l`, then `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are not assigned, `m` is an integer and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 3, i is 1, l is a list with at least n elements, d1 is a defaultdict with d1[2] = 1 and d1[i + 2] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1), d2 is a defaultdict with d2[n - 1] = 1 and d2[i] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1). If the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l is less than the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l, then d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]. Otherwise, d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]. j is 0, x and y are integers, m is at least 1 and stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. The program prints the difference between the values of d1 at indices y and x if y is greater than x, otherwise it prints the difference between the values of d2 at indices y and x.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is at least 3, i is 1, l is a list with at least n elements, d1 is a defaultdict with d1[2] = 1 and d1[i + 2] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1), d2 is a defaultdict with d2[n - 1] = 1 and d2[i] is updated based on the difference between the i + 1th and ith elements of l and the difference between the ith and i - 1th elements of l for all i in range(1, n - 1), j is 1, m is at least 2, x and y are integers, stdin is empty, and the program has printed the difference between the values of d1 at indices y and x if y is greater than x, otherwise it has printed the difference between the values of d2 at indices y and x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `l` is a list with at least `n` elements, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1` and `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` and the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l` for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`), `d2` is a defaultdict with `d2[n - 1] = 1` and `d2[i]` is updated based on the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l` and the difference between the `i`th and `i - 1`th elements of `l` for all `i` in range(1, `n - 1`), `j` is 2, `m` is at least 3, `x` and `y` are integers that have been read from the input, stdin is empty, and the program has printed the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it has printed the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
