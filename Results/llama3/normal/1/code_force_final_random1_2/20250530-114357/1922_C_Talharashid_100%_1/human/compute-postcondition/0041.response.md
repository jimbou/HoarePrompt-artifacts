Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `1`, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` if the difference between the `i + 2`th and `i + 1`th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `i + 1`th and `i`th elements of `l`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary where `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `stdin` contains no input. Additionally, `y` is less than or equal to `x`, and the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` is being printed.**
