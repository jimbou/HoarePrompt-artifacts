Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
        'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    rev_array = array[::-1]
    ans = []
    for j in range(l):
        ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
    print(''.join(map(str, ans)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `l` is a positive integer, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is a list containing the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter for each j in range(l), `j` is equal to l, and the string formed by concatenating all the letters in the list ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers, `ans` is a list containing lowercase English letters, each corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration, `j` is equal to `l`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter corresponds to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers, `ans` is a list containing the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list, where the last element is the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[l-1]` in the rest of the list and the second last element is the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[l-2]` in the rest of the list, `j` is `l-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter corresponds to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration, and the string of lowercase English letters corresponding to the counts of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
