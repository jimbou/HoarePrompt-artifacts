The code prints a string formed by concatenating the elements of the `ans` list. The `ans` list contains the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter for each j in range(l). Since `j` is equal to `l`, the loop that populates the `ans` list runs from 0 to `l-1`. For each `j`, the code counts the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the slice `rev_array[j:]` and subtracts 1 from the count. This value is used as an index to select a lowercase English letter from the alphabet. The selected letters are stored in the `ans` list. Finally, the `join` function concatenates the elements of the `ans` list into a single string, which is then printed.

Output: **A string formed by concatenating the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter for each j in range(l)**
