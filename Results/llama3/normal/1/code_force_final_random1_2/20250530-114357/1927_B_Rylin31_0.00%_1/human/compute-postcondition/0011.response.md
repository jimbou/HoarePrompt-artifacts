To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are `i` and `input()`. Since `input()` is a function call, we can't adjust its state directly. However, we can infer that the number of test cases is decreasing by 1 each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `input()` contains multiple test cases minus 2. To execute the loop again, `i` should be incremented by 1, and the number of test cases should decrease by 1.

State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `l` is a positive integer, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is a list containing the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter for each j in range(l), `j` is equal to l**
