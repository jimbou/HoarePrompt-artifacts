Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 1, l is a positive integer equal to the input value, array is a list of integers from stdin, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is an empty list, j is equal to l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2
Code of the loop:
for j in range(l):
    ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers, `ans` is a list containing a lowercase English letter, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers, `ans` is a list containing a lowercase English letter and another letter from `alp` based on the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers, `ans` is a list containing a lowercase English letter and another letter from `alp` based on the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list and the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list minus 1, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
