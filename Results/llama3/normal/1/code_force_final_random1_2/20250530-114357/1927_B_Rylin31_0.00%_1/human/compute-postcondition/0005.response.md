Output State: **`i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `l` is greater than 1, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is a list containing the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 1, ans has been appended with the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 0, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2, `l` is still greater than 1, the array and alp remain unchanged, rev_array is still a reversed list of integers, ans has been appended with the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter, and `j` is still 1.
