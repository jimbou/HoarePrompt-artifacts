Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers, `ans` is a list containing the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list, where the last element is the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[2]` in the rest of the list and the second last element is the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[2]` in the rest of the list, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter corresponds to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ans` has been updated with an additional element, which is the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[2]` in the rest of the list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
