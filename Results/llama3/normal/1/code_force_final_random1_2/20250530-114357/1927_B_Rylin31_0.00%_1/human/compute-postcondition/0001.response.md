Output State: **i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, l is a positive integer, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2, as two inputs have been consumed by the code. The variable `l` has been assigned a positive integer value from the first input. The `array` variable now holds a list of integers obtained from the second input. The `alp` variable is a list of all lowercase English letters. The `rev_array` variable contains the reversed list of integers from the `array` variable. Finally, the `ans` variable is an empty list.
