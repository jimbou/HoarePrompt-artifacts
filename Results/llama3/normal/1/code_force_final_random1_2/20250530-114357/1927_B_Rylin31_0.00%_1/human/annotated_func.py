#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n',
            'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
        
        rev_array = array[::-1]
        
        ans = []
        
        for j in range(l):
            ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
        
        print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
        
    #State: `i` is equal to the number of test cases, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers, `ans` is a list containing the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list, where the last element is the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[l-1]` in the rest of the list and the second last element is the lowercase English letter corresponding to the count of `rev_array[l-2]` in the rest of the list, `j` is `l-1`, stdin is empty, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter corresponds to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration, and the string of lowercase English letters corresponding to the counts of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes each test case by reversing the list of integers, counting the occurrences of each integer in the reversed list, and mapping these counts to lowercase English letters. Finally, it prints a string of these letters for each test case, effectively encoding the count of each integer in the reversed list as a string of lowercase English letters.
