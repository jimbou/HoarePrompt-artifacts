Output State: **i is 2, l is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, array is a list of integers from stdin, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is an empty list, j is equal to l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter corresponds to the count of rev_array[j] in the rest of the list for each iteration**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `l` is updated to a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1. The `array` variable now holds a list of integers from the standard input. The `alp` variable contains a list of all lowercase English letters. The `rev_array` variable holds a reversed list of integers from the `array` variable. The `ans` list is empty. The value of `j` is equal to the value of `l`. The standard input now contains one less test case. A string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter corresponds to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration.
