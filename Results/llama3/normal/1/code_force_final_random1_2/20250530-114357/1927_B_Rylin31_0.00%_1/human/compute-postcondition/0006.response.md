To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `l`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `l`. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `l` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `l` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `l` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `l` is greater than 2, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is a list containing the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 2, ans has been appended with the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter.**
