The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and the value returned by `int(input())` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`i` is 2, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers, `ans` is a list containing lowercase English letters, each corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration, `j` is equal to `l`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter corresponds to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list for each iteration**
