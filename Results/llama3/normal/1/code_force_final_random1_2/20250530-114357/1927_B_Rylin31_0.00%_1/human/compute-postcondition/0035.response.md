Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes each test case by reversing the list of integers, counting the occurrences of each integer in the reversed list, and mapping these counts to lowercase English letters. Finally, it prints a string of these letters for each test case, effectively encoding the count of each integer in the reversed list as a string of lowercase English letters.**
