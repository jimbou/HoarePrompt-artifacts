Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers, `ans` is a list containing a lowercase English letter and another letter from `alp` based on the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list and the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list minus 1, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 1, `l` is still a positive integer equal to the input value and is at least 1, `array` is still a list of integers from stdin, `alp` is still a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is still a reversed list of integers, `ans` now contains one more lowercase English letter from `alp` based on the count of `rev_array[j]` in the rest of the list minus 1, `j` is still 2, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
