Output State: **`i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `l` is a positive integer, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is a list containing the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter for each j in range(l), `j` is equal to l**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` remains 0, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2, `l` remains a positive integer, array remains a list of integers, alp remains a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array remains a reversed list of integers, ans is a list containing the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter for each j in range(l), and `j` is equal to l.
