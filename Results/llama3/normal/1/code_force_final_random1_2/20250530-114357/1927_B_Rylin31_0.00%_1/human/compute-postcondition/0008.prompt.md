Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, l is a positive integer, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for j in range(l):
    ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `l` is greater than 0, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is a list containing the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `l` is greater than 1, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is a list containing the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 1, ans has been appended with the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `l` is greater than 2, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed list of integers, ans is a list containing the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 2, ans has been appended with the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter, and the last element of ans is the (rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)th lowercase English letter.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
