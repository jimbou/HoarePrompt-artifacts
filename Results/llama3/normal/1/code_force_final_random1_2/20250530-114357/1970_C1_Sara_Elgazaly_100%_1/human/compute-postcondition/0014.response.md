Output State: **x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to tmp and the value is a non-empty list with one less element, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, and the two integers u, z is an integer equal to the first input, tmp is an integer equal to the last element of the list that was the value of the key-value pair in lst with key equal to the first input, one is False, stdin contains 1 input: an integer**

Explanation:
The first line of code changes the value of `one` from `True` to `False`. The second line of code removes the last element from the list that is the value of the key-value pair in `lst` with key equal to `tmp`, and assigns this removed element to `tmp`. The list in `lst` now has one less element. The other variables remain unchanged.
