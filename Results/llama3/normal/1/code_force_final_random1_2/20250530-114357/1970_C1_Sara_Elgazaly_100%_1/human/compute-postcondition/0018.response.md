Output State: **x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to the first input and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, two is False, one is False, tmp is u, stdin contains 1 input: an integer, z is an integer equal to the first input.**

In this output state, the value of `two` has been toggled to `False` due to the first line of the code. The second line of the code removes the last element from the list associated with the key `tmp` in the dictionary `rev` and assigns it to `tmp`. Since `tmp` was initially equal to the first input, which is also the key in the dictionary `rev`, the last element removed from the list is `u`. Therefore, `tmp` now holds the value `u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
