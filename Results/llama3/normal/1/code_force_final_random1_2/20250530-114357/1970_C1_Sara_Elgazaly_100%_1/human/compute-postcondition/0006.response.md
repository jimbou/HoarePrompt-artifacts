Output State: **x is an integer greater than 3, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b, u, and the two integers u, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, and the two integers u, stdin contains n-6 lines each containing two integers u and v.**

In this output state, the values of x and y remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The dictionary lst now has an additional element b appended to its value list, which originally contained only the two integers u. Similarly, the dictionary rev now has an additional element a appended to its value list, which originally contained only the two integers u. The stdin now contains n-6 lines, as two lines have been consumed by the input() function.
