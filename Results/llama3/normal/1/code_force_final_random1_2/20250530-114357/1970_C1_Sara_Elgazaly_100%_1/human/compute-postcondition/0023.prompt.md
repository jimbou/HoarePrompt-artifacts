Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to the first input and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, and the two integers u, z is an integer equal to the first input, tmp is an integer equal to the first input, two is True, one is False, stdin contains 1 input: an integer.
Code of the loop:
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to the first input and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, two is False, one is False, tmp is u, stdin contains 1 input: an integer, z is an integer equal to the first input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to the first input and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with at least a key-value pair where the key is u and the value is a list with one less element than before, two is True, one is False, tmp is the last element of the list associated with the key u in the dictionary rev, stdin contains 1 input: an integer, z is an integer equal to the first input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to the first input and the value is an empty list, rev has at least a key-value pair where the key is u and the value is a list with at least one element, two is False, one is False, tmp is the second last element of the list associated with the key u in the dictionary rev and tmp is a key in rev, stdin contains 1 input: an integer, z is an integer equal to the first input


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
