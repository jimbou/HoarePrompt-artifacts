Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, constructs a directed graph from the input, and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph in both forward and backward directions. The function then prints 'Hermione' if the DFS traversal in both directions visits the same nodes in the same order, and 'Ron' otherwise. The function effectively determines whether the graph is a directed path or not.**
