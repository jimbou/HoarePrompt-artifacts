According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable lst and tmp. If lst[tmp] is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to the first input and the value is a non-empty list with two less elements, tmp is an integer equal to the second last element of the list that was the value of the key-value pair in lst with key equal to the first input. For the loop to be executed one more time, lst[tmp] must not be empty. So lst must have a key-value pair where the key is equal to tmp and the value is a non-empty list. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to tmp and the value is a non-empty list, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, and the two integers u, z is an integer equal to the first input, tmp is an integer equal to the second last element of the list that was the value of the key-value pair in lst with key equal to the first input, one is True, stdin contains 1 input: an integer**
