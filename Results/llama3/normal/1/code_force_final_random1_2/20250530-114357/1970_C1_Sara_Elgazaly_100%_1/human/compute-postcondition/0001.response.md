To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is greater than 1.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer equal to the second input, `lst` is an empty dictionary, `rev` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**
