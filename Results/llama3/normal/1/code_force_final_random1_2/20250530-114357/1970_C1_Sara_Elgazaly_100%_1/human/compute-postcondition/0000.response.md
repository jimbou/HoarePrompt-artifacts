Output State: **x is an integer equal to the first input, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is an empty dictionary, rev is an empty dictionary, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1**.

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` are determined by the first two inputs from stdin, which are integers. The `lst` and `rev` dictionaries are initialized as empty dictionaries using the `defaultdict` function. The remaining inputs in stdin, which consist of `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one integer `u_1`, are left unchanged.
