Output State: **x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to the first input and the value is an empty list, rev has at least a key-value pair where the key is u and the value is a list with at least one element, two is False, one is False, tmp is the second last element of the list associated with the key u in the dictionary rev and tmp is a key in rev, stdin contains 1 input: an integer, z is an integer equal to the first input**

The first line of code flips the boolean value of `two`, changing it from `True` to `False`. The second line removes the last element from the list associated with the key `tmp` in the dictionary `rev` and assigns it to `tmp`. This means that `tmp` now holds the second last element of the list associated with the key `u` in the dictionary `rev`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
