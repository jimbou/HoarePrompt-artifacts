Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer equal to 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b, u, and the two integers u, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, and the two integers u, z is an integer equal to the first input, tmp is an integer equal to the first input, one is True, stdin contains 1 input: an integer.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to the first input and the value is a non-empty list with one less element, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, and the two integers u, z is an integer equal to the first input, tmp is an integer equal to the last element of the list that was the value of the key-value pair in lst with key equal to the first input, one is False, stdin contains 1 input: an integer
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to the first input and the value is a non-empty list with two less elements, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, and the two integers u, z is an integer equal to the first input, tmp is an integer equal to the second last element of the list that was the value of the key-value pair in lst with key equal to the first input, one is True, stdin contains 1 input: an integer
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: x is 1, y is an integer equal to the second input, lst is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is equal to tmp and the value is a non-empty list with one less element, rev is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a, u, and the two integers u, z is an integer equal to the first input, tmp is an integer equal to the last element of the list that was the value of the key-value pair in lst with key equal to the first input, one is False, stdin contains 1 input: an integer


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
