The only variable in the loop head is variable  c and cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable c and cases. If c is less than cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, c is 0, cases is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again c is increased by 1 so c is 1 and for the loop to execute again cases must be greater than 1.
State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is -1. `total` is the minimum total cost to change or pass at all positions from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum total cost to change or pass at all positions from `na_frente` to `pos_final` plus the cost to change at position `pos_final`, and the minimum total cost to change or pass at all positions from `na_frente` to `pos_final` plus the cost to change at position `pos_final` is printed**
