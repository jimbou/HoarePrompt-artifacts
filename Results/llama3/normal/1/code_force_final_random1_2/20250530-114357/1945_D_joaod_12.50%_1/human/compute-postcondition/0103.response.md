Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the minimum cost between changing to option A at position `v` and passing to option B at position `v`, and `best` is updated to be the minimum between its original value and the new `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` is larger than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change a at position `v` is less than the cost to pass b at position `v`, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v`. Otherwise, `total` is set to the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v`.***
