Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus two, `total` is either updated based on the comparison between the cost to change at index `v` and the cost to pass at index `v` or is greater than or equal to 0, `best` is either 10^12 or `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, or either the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` or remains 10^12 if `v` is greater than `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` is updated to be the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `total` is either updated based on the comparison between the cost to change at index `v` and the cost to pass at index `v` or is greater than or equal to 0. The value of `best` is either 10^12 or the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, or either the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` or remains 10^12 if `v` is greater than `pos_final`.
