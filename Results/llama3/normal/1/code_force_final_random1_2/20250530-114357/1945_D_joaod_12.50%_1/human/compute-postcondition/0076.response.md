Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus two, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`, If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v`, which is equal to `na_frente - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, and if it is true, `best` will be updated to the new value of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v`.
