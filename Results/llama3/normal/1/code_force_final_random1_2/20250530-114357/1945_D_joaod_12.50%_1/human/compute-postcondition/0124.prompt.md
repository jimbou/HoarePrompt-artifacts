Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), c is 2, na_frente is an integer minus two, pos_final is an integer minus two, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, v is -1, total is 0, and best is 10^12.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the minimum cost between changing to option A at position `v` and passing to option B at position `v`, and `best` is updated to be the minimum between its original value and the new `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` is larger than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change a at position `v` is less than the cost to pass b at position `v`, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v`. Otherwise, `total` is set to the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`. In both cases, if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 3, `na_frente` is an integer minus three, `pos_final` is an integer minus three, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three inputs, `v` is `na_frente - 2`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`. In both cases, if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
