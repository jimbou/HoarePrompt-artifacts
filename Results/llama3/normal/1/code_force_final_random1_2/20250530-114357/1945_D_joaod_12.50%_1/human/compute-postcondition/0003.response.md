To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `v` and `na_frente`. The loop will execute as long as `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, since the range starts from `na_frente` and goes down to -1.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente`**
