Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), c is 1, na_frente is an integer minus two, pos_final is an integer minus one, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, v is -1, total is 0, and best is 10^12.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is  `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if the cost to change at position `v` is less than the cost to pass at position `v`, `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `best` is either 10^12 or the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is less than the former. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass at position `v`, and `best` is either 10^12 or the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is less than the former. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change to `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass to `b` at position `v`, `total` is set to the cost to change to `a` at position `v`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass to `b` at position `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is  `na_frente` minus one. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then the total cost is increased by either the cost to change to A or the cost to pass to B, depending on which is less, and the best cost is updated if necessary. Otherwise, the total cost is increased by either the cost to change to A or the cost to pass to B, depending on which is less.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus two. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
