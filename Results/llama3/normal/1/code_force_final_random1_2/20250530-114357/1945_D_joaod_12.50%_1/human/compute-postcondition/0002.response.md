Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), c is 0, na_frente is an integer minus one, pos_final is an integer minus one, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is 0, best is 10^12, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**

The code executes as follows:

*   The first two lines read two integers from stdin and assign them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`, respectively. Since `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers, they become the values of the inputs minus one.
*   The next two lines read two lists of integers from stdin and assign them to `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, respectively. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
*   The fifth and sixth lines decrement `na_frente` and `pos_final` by one, respectively.
*   The seventh line initializes `total` to 0.
*   The eighth line initializes `best` to 10^12.

The final state includes the initial state of `cases` and `c`, the modified values of `na_frente` and `pos_final`, the assigned values of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, and the initialized values of `total` and `best`.
