Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 3, `na_frente` is an integer minus three, `pos_final` is an integer minus three, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three inputs, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `best` is not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `best` have also been updated based on the value of `v` relative to `pos_final`.
