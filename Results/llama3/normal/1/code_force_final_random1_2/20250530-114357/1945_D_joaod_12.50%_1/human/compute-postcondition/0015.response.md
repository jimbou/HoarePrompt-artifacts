Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is 10^12, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to be the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, which is less than the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
