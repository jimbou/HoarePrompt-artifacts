Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost of passing through the `b` path at the position `v`, which is equal to `na_frente - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
