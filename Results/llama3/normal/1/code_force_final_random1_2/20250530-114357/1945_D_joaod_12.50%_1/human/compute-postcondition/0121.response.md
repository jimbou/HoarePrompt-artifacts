Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 3, `na_frente` is an integer minus three, `pos_final` is an integer minus three, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three inputs. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `best` is still greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `best` is still greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables keep their initial values except for `total`, which is increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `na_frente - 2`. The value of `best` is not changed because it is still greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`.
