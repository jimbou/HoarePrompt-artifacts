To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v` and `na_frente`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is  `na_frente`, `total` is 0, and `best` is 10^12**
