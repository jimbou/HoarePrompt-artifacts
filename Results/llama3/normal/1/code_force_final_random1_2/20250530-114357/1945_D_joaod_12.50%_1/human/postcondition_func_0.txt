This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, and two lists of n integers each. It calculates the minimum total cost of traversing from the first position to the last position, considering the costs of either changing to option A or passing to option B at each position. The function prints the minimum total cost for each test case.
