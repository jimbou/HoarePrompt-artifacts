Output State: **cases is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), c is 2, na_frente is an integer minus two, pos_final is an integer minus two, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, v is -1, total is 0, and best is 10^12.**

The code snippet first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`, then reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It then decrements `na_frente` and `pos_final` by 1. The last two lines initialize `total` to 0 and `best` to 10^12. The values of `cases`, `c`, `v`, and the remaining inputs in stdin are not affected by the code.
