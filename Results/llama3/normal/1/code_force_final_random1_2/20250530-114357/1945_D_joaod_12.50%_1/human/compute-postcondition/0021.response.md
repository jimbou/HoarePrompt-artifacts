Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus one, `total` is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change at index `v` and the cost to pass at index `v`. If the cost to change at index `v` is less than the cost to pass at index `v`, then `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to change at index `v`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to pass at index `v`. If `best` is greater than the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, then `total` is set to the cost to change `a` at position `v`. Otherwise, `total` is greater than or equal to 0. `best` is now equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of the current `total` and the cost to change `a` at position `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
