Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the cost of passing through the current position (`custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`). The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, but its value may have changed due to the increase in `total`.
