Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, and `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `best`, which is now assigned the value of `total` plus the element at index `na_frente - 1` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Note that the value of `total` is not specified in the initial state, so it is left as is in the output state.
