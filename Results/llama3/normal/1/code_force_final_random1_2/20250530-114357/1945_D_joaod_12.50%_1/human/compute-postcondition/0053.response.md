Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, the current value of `v` equals `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the cost to pass at position `v`, and `best` is either 10^12 or the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is less than the former. Additionally, the cost to change at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass at position `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `total`, which is increased by the cost to pass at position `v`. The value of `best` remains the same, as it is either 10^12 or the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, whichever is less. The relationship between the cost to change at position `v` and the cost to pass at position `v` remains the same.
