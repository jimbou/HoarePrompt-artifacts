Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, the current value of `v` equals `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `best` is either 10^12 or the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is less than the former.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost of changing at the current position `v` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `best` is still either 10^12 or the sum of `total` and the cost of changing at the current position `v`, whichever is smaller.
