Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200,000). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n separated by spaces (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `cases` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The rest of the input remains unchanged, with multiple test cases still present in the stdin. Each test case still consists of three lines, with the first line containing two integers n and m, the second line containing n integers a_1 to a_n, and the third line containing n integers b_1 to b_n.
