Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is  `na_frente` minus one. If the cost to change to A at the current position is less than the cost to pass to B, then the total cost is increased by the cost to change to A. Otherwise, the total cost is increased by the cost to pass to B.***
