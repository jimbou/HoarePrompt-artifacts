Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 3, `na_frente` is an integer minus three, `pos_final` is an integer minus three, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three inputs, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` based on the conditions, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]` if it was greater than the new value.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables keep their initial values except for `total` and `best`. `total` is increased by either the cost to change at position `na_frente - 2` or the cost to pass at position `na_frente - 2`, depending on the conditions. `best` is updated to be the new total plus the cost to change at position `na_frente - 2`, but only if it was previously greater than this new value.
