Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is equal to `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `best` is now equal to the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is less than or equal to the previous value of `best` since the current value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` in the initial state.
