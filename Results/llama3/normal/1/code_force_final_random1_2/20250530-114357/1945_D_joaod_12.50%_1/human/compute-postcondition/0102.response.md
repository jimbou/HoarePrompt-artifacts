Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `v` is larger than `pos_final`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. If the cost to change a at position `v` is less than the cost to pass b at position `v`, then `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v`. Otherwise, `total` is set to the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v`.***
