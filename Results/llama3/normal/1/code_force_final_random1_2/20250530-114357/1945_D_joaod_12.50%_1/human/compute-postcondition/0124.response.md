Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is `na_frente + 1`, `na_frente` is an integer minus `na_frente`, `pos_final` is an integer minus `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `na_frente` inputs, `v` is `-1`, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between changing to option A and passing to option B at each position from `na_frente` to `0`, and `best` is the minimum total cost among all possible paths.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over all positions from `na_frente` to `0`, updating the `total` cost by adding the minimum cost between changing to option A and passing to option B at each position. The `best` cost is updated to be the minimum total cost among all possible paths. The values of `cases`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of `c` is incremented by `na_frente`, and the values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by `na_frente`. The value of `v` is set to `-1`.
