Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is  `na_frente` minus one. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then the total cost is increased by either the cost to change to A or the cost to pass to B, depending on which is less, and the best cost is updated if necessary. Otherwise, the total cost is increased by either the cost to change to A or the cost to pass to B, depending on which is less.**
