Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus two, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `na_frente - 2` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
