Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 3, `na_frente` is an integer minus three, `pos_final` is an integer minus three, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three inputs, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `best` is not updated.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. The value of `best` may or may not have been updated, depending on the values of `v` and `pos_final`. All other variables remain unchanged.
