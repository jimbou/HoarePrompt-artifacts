Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is  `na_frente`, `total` is increased by the cost to pass to `b` at position `v`, `best` is 10^12, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The cost to change to `a` at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass to `b` at position `v`**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost is increased by the cost to pass to `b` at the current position `v`, which is the same as `na_frente`. All other variables remain unchanged.
