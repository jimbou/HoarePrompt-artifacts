To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `v` in the loop head.


At the end of the previous iteration, `v` is `na_frente` minus one. For the loop to execute again, `v` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order from `na_frente` to -1.


Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:


State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus two**
