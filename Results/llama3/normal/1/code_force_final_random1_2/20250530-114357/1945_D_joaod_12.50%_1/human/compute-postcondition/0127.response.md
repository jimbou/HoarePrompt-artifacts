Output State: **cases is 0, c is equal to the initial value of cases, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer minus one, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3*cases inputs, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum costs between changing to option A and passing to option B at each position from na_frente to 0, and best is the minimum total cost among all possible paths, and the minimum total cost among all possible paths which is best is being printed**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be that the number of test cases (`cases`) will be 0, the loop counter (`c`) will be equal to the initial number of test cases, and the variables `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `v` will have the same values as after the third iteration. The `total` variable will hold the sum of the minimum costs between changing to option A and passing to option B at each position from `na_frente` to 0, and the `best` variable will hold the minimum total cost among all possible paths. The minimum total cost among all possible paths, which is stored in `best`, will be printed.
