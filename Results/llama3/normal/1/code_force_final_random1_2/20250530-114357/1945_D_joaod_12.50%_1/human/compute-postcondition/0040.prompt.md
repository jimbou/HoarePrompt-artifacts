Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), c is 0, na_frente is an integer minus one, pos_final is an integer minus one, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is 0, best is 10^12, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change at index `v` and the cost to pass at index `v`. If the cost to change at index `v` is less than the cost to pass at index `v`, then `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to change at index `v`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to pass at index `v`. If `best` is greater than the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, then `total` is set to the cost to change `a` at position `v`. Otherwise, `total` is greater than or equal to 0. `best` remains 10^12.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus one. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change at index `v` and the cost to pass at index `v`. If the cost to change at index `v` is less than the cost to pass at index `v`, then `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to change at index `v` and `best` is either 10^12 or `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to pass at index `v` and `best` is either 10^12 or `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, then `total` is set to the cost to change `a` at position `v` and `best` is either the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` or remains 10^12. Otherwise, `total` is greater than or equal to 0 and `best` is 10^12.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus two. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change at index `v` and the cost to pass at index `v`. If the cost to change at index `v` is less than the cost to pass at index `v`, then `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to change at index `v` and `best` is either 10^12 or `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to pass at index `v` and `best` is either 10^12 or `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, then `total` is set to the cost to change `a` at position `v` and `best` is either the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` or remains 10^12. Otherwise, `total` is greater than or equal to 0 and `best` is 10^12. If `best` is greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
