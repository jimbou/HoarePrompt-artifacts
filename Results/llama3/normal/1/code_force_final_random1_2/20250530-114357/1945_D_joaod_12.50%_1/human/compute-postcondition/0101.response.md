Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is 10^12, `v` is larger than `pos_final`, and the cost to change a at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass b at position `v`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is between 3 and 10^4, c is 2, na_frente and pos_final are integers minus two, custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b are lists of integers, v is equal to na_frente, the total cost is the cost to pass b at position v, the best cost is 10^12, v is larger than pos_final, and the cost to change a at position v is not less than the cost to pass b at position v. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
