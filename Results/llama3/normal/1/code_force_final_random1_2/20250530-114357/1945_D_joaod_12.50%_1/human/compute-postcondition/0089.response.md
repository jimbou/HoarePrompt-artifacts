Postcondition: **cases is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), c is 2, na_frente is an integer minus two, pos_final is an integer minus two, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, the current value of v is na_frente and is less than or equal to pos_final, total is 0, and best is 10^12. Additionally, the current value of best is greater than the sum of total and the value at index v in custo_pra_trocar_a.**
