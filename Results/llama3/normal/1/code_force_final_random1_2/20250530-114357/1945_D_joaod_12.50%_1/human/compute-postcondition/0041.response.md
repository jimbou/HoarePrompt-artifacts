The code prints the minimum total cost to change or pass at all positions from `na_frente` to `pos_final` plus the cost to change at position `pos_final`. Where `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, and the cost to change or pass at each position is determined by the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

Output: **the minimum total cost to change or pass at all positions from -1 to [pos_final] plus the cost to change at position [pos_final] (where pos_final is an integer minus one)**
