To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`, so we can only adjust the state of `v` and `na_frente`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `v`. If `v` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is `na_frente`, which is an integer minus two. For the loop to execute again, `v` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and `v` is `na_frente - 1`.**
