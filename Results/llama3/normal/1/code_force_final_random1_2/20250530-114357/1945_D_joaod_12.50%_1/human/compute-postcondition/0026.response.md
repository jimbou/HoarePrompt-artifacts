Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus one, `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to change at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `best` is either the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` or remains 10^12.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost to change at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The value of `best` has been updated if the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the previous value of `best`. All other variables remain unchanged.
