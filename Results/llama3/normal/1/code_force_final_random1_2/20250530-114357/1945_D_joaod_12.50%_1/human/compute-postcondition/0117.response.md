Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 3, `na_frente` is an integer minus three, `pos_final` is an integer minus three, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three inputs, `v` is `na_frente - 2`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]. In both cases, if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]. If `best` is not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`, regardless of whether `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` or greater than `pos_final`. The value of `best` may also be updated if it is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
