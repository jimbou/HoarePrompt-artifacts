Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, the current value of `v` is `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is 0, and `best` is equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be equal to the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `best` is now less than or equal to its previous value, since `total` is 0 and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is a non-negative integer.
