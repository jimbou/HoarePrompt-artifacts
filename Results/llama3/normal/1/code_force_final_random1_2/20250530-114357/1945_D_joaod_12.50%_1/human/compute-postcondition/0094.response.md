Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, the current value of `v` is `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is 0, `best` is updated to be the minimum between its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.***
