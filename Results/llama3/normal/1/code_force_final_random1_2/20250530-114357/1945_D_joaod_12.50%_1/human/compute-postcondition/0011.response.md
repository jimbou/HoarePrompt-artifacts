Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the previous value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than the previous value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The cost to change at index `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass at index `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has been updated by adding the cost to pass at the current index `v` to the previous total cost. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating the best cost is still valid, and the relationship between the cost to change and the cost to pass at index `v` remains the same.
