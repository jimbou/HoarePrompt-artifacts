The only variable in the loop head is variable  c and cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` and `cases`. If `c` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1, `cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `c` is increased by 1 so `c` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `cases` must be greater than 2.
State: **cases is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), c is 2, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer minus one, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum costs to change to A or pass to B for all positions from na_frente to 0, and best is the minimum total cost encountered during the loop execution, and best (minimum total cost encountered during the loop execution) is printed**
