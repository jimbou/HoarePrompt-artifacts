Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The cost to change at index `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass at index `v`.***
