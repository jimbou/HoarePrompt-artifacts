Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200,000). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n separated by spaces (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is -1. `total` is the minimum total cost to change or pass at all positions from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum total cost to change or pass at all positions from `na_frente` to `pos_final` plus the cost to change at position `pos_final`, and the minimum total cost to change or pass at all positions from `na_frente` to `pos_final` plus the cost to change at position `pos_final` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cases is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), c is 1, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer minus one, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum costs to change to A or pass to B for all positions from na_frente to 0, and best is the minimum total cost encountered during the loop execution, and best (minimum total cost encountered during the loop execution) is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is `na_frente + 1`, `na_frente` is an integer minus `na_frente`, `pos_final` is an integer minus `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `na_frente` inputs, `v` is `-1`, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between changing to option A and passing to option B at each position from `na_frente` to `0`, and `best` is the minimum total cost among all possible paths, and the minimum total cost among all possible paths which is `best` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
