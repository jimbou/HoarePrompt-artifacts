Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` plus the previous value of `total`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than the new value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the new value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `total` has been updated by adding the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
