Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, the current value of `v` is `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is the minimum between its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost of passing through position `v` in the `custo_pra_passar_b` list. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the values of `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `v` are still valid. The value of `best` is still the minimum between its original value and the updated `total` plus the cost of changing at position `v` in the `custo_pra_trocar_a` list.
