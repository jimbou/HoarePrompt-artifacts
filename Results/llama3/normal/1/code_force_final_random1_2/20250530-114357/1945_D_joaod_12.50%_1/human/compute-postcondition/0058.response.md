Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is  `na_frente`, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The cost to change to `a` at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass to `b` at position `v`***
