Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, the current value of `v` equals `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is 0, and `best` is equal to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. This means that `best` now holds the value of `total` plus the cost of changing at the current position `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
