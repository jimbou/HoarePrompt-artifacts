Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus two, `total` is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change at index `v` and the cost to pass at index `v`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to change at index `v`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is set to the cost to change `a` at position `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated based on the comparison between the cost to change at index `v` and the cost to pass at index `v`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to change at index `v`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is set to the cost to change `a` at position `v`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
