Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus one, `total` is updated to the previous value of `total` plus the cost to pass at index `v`, `best` is either 10^12 or `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost to pass at index `v` from the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `total` is now the previous value of `total` plus the cost to pass at index `v`. The value of `best` is still either 10^12 or the updated value of `total` plus the value at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
