The value of `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v`. The value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v` is less than the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs. Therefore, the Output State is: `cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v`, `best` is 10^12, and `v` is larger than `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer minus two, `pos_final` is an integer minus two, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `v`, `best` is 10^12, `v` is larger than `pos_final`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.**
