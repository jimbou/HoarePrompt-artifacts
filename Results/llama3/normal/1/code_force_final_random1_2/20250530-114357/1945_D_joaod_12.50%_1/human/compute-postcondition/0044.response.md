Output State: **cases is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), c is 1, na_frente is an integer minus two, pos_final is an integer minus one, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, v is -1, total is 0, and best is 10^12.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. It then reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by 1. The variable `total` is initialized to 0, and the variable `best` is initialized to 10^12. The values of `cases`, `c`, and `v` remain unchanged.
