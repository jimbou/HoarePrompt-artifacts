Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is `na_frente` minus two, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the element at index `na_frente - 2` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
