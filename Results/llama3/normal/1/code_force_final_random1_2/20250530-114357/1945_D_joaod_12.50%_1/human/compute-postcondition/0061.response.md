Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer minus one, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `v` is  `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if the cost to change at position `v` is less than the cost to pass at position `v`, `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `best` is either 10^12 or the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is less than the former. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass at position `v`, and `best` is either 10^12 or the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is less than the former. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change to `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass to `b` at position `v`, `total` is set to the cost to change to `a` at position `v`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass to `b` at position `v`.***
