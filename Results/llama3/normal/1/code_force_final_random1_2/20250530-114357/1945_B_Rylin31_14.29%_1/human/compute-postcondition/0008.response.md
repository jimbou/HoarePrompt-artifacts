Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. Additionally, it is not the case that m is divisible by both a and b and both a and b are not equal to 1, and the sum of the integer division of mn by a and the integer division of mn by b is being printed**
