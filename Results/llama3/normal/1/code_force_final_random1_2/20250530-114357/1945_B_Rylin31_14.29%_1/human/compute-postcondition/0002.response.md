Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m.**

The code reads a set of three space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calculates the minimum of `a` and `b`, adds `m` to it, and assigns the result to `mn`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers. The values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn` are updated according to the calculations.
