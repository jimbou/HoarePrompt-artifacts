Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program takes three inputs: the frequency of launching for the first installation (a), the second installation (b), and the time the firework is visible in the sky (m).

The program first calculates the minimum time (mn) it takes for a firework to be visible in the sky, which is the minimum of a and b plus m. This is because the firework will be visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, and the minimum time it takes for a firework to be visible is the minimum of the launch frequencies plus the visibility time.

The program then checks if m is a multiple of both a and b, and if a and b are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it means that the fireworks launched from both installations will be visible for the same amount of time, and the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is the sum of the number of fireworks launched from each installation plus 1 (because the fireworks launched at the same time will be visible for one minute).

If the condition is not true, the program simply calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by dividing the minimum time (mn) by the launch frequencies (a and b) and summing the results.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
