Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains t sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m, where each of a, b, and m is between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive).
