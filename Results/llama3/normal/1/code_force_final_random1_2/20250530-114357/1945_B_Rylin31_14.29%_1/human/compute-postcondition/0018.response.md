Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m.**

The code reads a set of three space-separated integers a, b, and m from stdin, and assigns them to the variables a, b, and m, respectively. The variable mn is then calculated as the minimum of a and b plus m. The value of mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. The code does not modify the values of t and i, which remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-4 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m.
