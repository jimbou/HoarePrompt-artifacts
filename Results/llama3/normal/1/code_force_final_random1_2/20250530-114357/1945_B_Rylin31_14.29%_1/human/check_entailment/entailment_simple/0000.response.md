Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the frequencies of launching for the first and second installations (`a` and `b`) and the time the firework is visible in the sky (`m`).
3. It calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and adds `m` to it, which gives the maximum number of minutes that a firework can be visible in the sky.
4. If `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` (i.e., `m % a == 0` and `m % b == 0`), and both `a` and `b` are not equal to 1, it adds 1 to the result. This is because in this case, both installations will launch a firework at the same time, and both fireworks will be visible for one minute.
5. Otherwise, it simply calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by dividing `mn` by `a` and `b` and adding the results.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
