Output State: **t is an integer equal to 0, i is equal to the initial value of t, stdin is empty, a, b, m, and mn are undefined.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, the variable i will be equal to the initial value of t (which is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive), the standard input (stdin) will be empty because all the input sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m have been processed, and the variables a, b, m, and mn will be undefined because they are no longer needed after the loop has finished executing.
