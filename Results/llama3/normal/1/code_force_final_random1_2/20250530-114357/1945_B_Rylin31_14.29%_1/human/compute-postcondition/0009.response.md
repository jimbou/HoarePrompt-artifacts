Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. If m is divisible by both a and b, and both a and b are greater than 1, then the value printed is mn // a + mn // b + 1. Otherwise, the value printed is the sum of the integer division of mn by a and the integer division of mn by b.**
