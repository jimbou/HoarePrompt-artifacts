The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. If m is divisible by both a and b, and neither a nor b is 1, then the value of mn // a + mn // b + 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of mn by a and mn by b is printed.**
