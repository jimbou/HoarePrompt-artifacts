Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-3` sets of three space-separated integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, as one set has been consumed by the `input()` function. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the newly read values from stdin, and `mn` is calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
