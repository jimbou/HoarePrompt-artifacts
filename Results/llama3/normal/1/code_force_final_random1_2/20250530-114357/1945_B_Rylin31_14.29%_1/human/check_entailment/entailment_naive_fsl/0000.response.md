Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when `a` or `b` is 1 correctly. In this case, the program will print `mn // a + mn // b` which is incorrect because when `a` or `b` is 1, the number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `m + 1`, not `mn // a + mn // b`.

For example, when `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `m = 3`, the program will print `4` which is incorrect. The correct answer is `4` because after 3 minutes, there will be 4 fireworks visible in the sky: one launched at time 0, one launched at time 1, one launched at time 2, and one launched at time 3.

To fix this issue, the program should handle the case when `a` or `b` is 1 separately. Here is the corrected code:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print(m + 1)
        else:
            mn = min(a, b) + m
            if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0:
                print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
            else:
                print(mn // a + mn // b)
```
This corrected code will handle the case when `a` or `b` is 1 correctly and print the correct answer.
