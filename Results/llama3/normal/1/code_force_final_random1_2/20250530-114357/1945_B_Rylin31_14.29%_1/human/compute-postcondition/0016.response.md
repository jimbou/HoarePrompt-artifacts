Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, m, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. If m is divisible by both a and b, and neither a nor b is 1, then the value of mn // a + mn // b + 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of mn by a and mn by b is printed.***
