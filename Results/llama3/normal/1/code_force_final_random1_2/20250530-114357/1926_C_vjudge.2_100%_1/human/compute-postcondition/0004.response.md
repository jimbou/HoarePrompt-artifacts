Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is a string of at least 1 character, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the first character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i`, `j` is the first character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `N`, `t`, `j` and the stdin remains the same. The list `pd` is updated such that the element at the index equal to the ASCII value of the first character of string `i` is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i`. The string `i` and the rest of the list `pd` remains the same.
