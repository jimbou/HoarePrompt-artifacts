Output: **`N` is greater than 200000, `i` is a string of length at least 0, `t` is an integer that must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, `j` is the last character of string `i`, `_` is 0, `n` is a list of integers, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is being printed, and `n` is assigned the value `int(input())` where `input` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is printed**
