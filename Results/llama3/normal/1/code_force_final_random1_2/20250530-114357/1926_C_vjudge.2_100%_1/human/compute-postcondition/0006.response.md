Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is a string of at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the first character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i` and the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the second character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the second character of string `i`, `j` is the second character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `pd` at the index equal to the ASCII value of the second character of string `i` has been increased by the integer value of the second character of string `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
