To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `j`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a string of at least 1 character, and `j` is the first character of the string `i`. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least one more character. So, `i` is a string of at least 2 characters. 

The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the second character of the string `i`.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is a string of at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the first character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i`, `j` is the second character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.**
