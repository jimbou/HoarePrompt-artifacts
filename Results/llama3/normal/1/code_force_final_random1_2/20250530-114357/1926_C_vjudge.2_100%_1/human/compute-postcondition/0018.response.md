Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is a string of length at least 0, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be an empty string (since the loop iterates over each character in `i`), and `j` will no longer be present in the string `i` (since it has been processed in the previous iterations). The list `pd` will have been updated according to the loop's body, with each element at the index equal to the ASCII value of each character in `i` increased by the integer value of that character. The rest of the variables (`N`, `t`, and the input in `stdin`) remain unchanged.
