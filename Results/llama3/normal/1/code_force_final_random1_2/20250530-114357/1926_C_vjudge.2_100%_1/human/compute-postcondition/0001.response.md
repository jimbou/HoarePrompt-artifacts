To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `N`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `N` to be greater than 1, and set `i` to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**
