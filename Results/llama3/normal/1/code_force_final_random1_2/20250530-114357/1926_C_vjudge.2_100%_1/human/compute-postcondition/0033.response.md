To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates `t` times.

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution. Its value is not relevant to the loop's state.

The other variables in the state (`N`, `i`, `pd`, `n`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`N` is greater than 200000, `i` is a string of length at least 0, `t` is an integer that must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, `j` is the last character of string `i`, `_` is 0, `n` is a list of integers, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is being printed**
