The value of `pd[i]` is increased by the value of `pd[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `pd[i - 1]` is `pd[0]`, which is 0. Therefore, the value of `pd[1]` is increased by 0, which means it remains the same. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**
