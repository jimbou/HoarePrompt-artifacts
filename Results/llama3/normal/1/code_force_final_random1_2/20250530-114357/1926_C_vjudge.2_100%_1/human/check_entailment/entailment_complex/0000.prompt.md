Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case). Each integer is between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive.
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [(0) for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
        
    #State: N is greater than 200000, i is a string of length at least 0, t is an integer, pd is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string i which is increased by the integer value of each character of string i, and pd[2] is increased by pd[1], and pd[i] is increased by the integer value of character j, j is not present in the string i, and pd[i] is increased by pd[i - 1], and pd[i] is increased by the integer value of each character of string i, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, j is the last character of string i.
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(pd[n])
        
    #State: `N` is greater than 200000, `i` is a string of length at least 0, `t` is 0, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, `j` is the last character of string `i`, `_` is `t`, `n` is a list of integers, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is being printed, and `n` is assigned the value `int(stdin input)` where `stdin input` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is printed, and stdin is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a list of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents a test case. For each test case, the function prints the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to the given integer. The function uses a precomputed list `pd` to store the cumulative sum of digits for all integers from 1 to 200001, and uses this list to efficiently compute the sum of digits for each test case.
