To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`. If the string `i` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute.

State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `j` is the first character of string `i`**
