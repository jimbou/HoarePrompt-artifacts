To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in str(i):`. This means we are iterating over each character `j` in the string `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a string of length at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be a string, but its length can be reduced by 1, since we have already processed one character.

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is a character in the string `i`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be the next character in the string `i`.

The other variables `N`, `t`, `pd`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is a string of length at least 1, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is the next character in the string `i`, and `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers**
