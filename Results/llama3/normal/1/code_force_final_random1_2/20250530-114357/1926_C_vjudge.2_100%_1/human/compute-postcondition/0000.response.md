The first line assigns the value of `2 * 100000.0 + 1` to `N`, making `N` equal to 200001. The second line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`. Since stdin contains two inputs, the first input is an integer, and the second input is a list of integers, after this line, stdin contains one input: a list of integers. The third line creates a list `pd` of size `N` with all elements initialized to 0.

Output State: **N is 200001, t is an integer, pd is a list of 200001 zeros, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**
