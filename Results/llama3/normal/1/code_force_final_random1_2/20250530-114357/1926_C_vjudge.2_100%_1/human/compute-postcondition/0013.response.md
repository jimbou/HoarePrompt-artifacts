Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is a string of length at least 1, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is a character in the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `N` remains greater than 2, the string `i` remains unchanged, the integer `t` remains unchanged, the list `pd` remains a list of 200001 integers with the first element being 0, and the rest being zeros except for the elements at indices equal to the ASCII values of characters in string `i`, which are increased by the integer values of those characters, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`. Additionally, the value at index `i` in list `pd` is increased by the integer value of character `j`. The character `j` remains a character in the string `i`, and the stdin still contains a list of integers as input.
