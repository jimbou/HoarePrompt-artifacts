Output State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second character of string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `j` is the second character of string `i`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `N` remains greater than 3, the string `i` remains unchanged with at least 2 characters, the integer `t` remains unchanged, the list `pd` remains a list of 200001 integers with the first element being 0, and the rest being zeros except for the elements at indices equal to the ASCII values of characters in string `i`, which are increased by the integer values of those characters. Additionally, `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, which is not present in string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i`, and finally `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second character of string `i`. The stdin still contains 1 input: a list of integers, and `j` remains the second character of string `i`.
