Output State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is a string with at least 3 characters, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second character of string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the third character of string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `j` is the third character of string `i`**

In this output state, the value of `pd[i]` has been updated by adding the integer value of the third character of string `i`, which is `j`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `pd` still has the same structure, with the first element being 0 and the rest being zeros except for the elements at indices equal to the ASCII values of the characters in string `i`, which have been increased by the integer values of those characters. The stdin still contains a list of integers as input.
