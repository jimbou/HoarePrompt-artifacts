Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is a string of length at least 2, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is a character in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `N` is still greater than 2, the string `i` still has a length of at least 2, the integer `t` remains unchanged, and the list `pd` still has 200001 integers. The first element of `pd` is still 0, and the rest of the elements are still zeros except for the elements at indices equal to the ASCII values of the characters in string `i`, which have been increased by the integer values of those characters. Additionally, `pd[2]` has been increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` has been increased by the integer value of character `j`, where `j` is a character in the string `i`. The stdin still contains a list of integers as input.
