This function reads a list of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents a test case. For each test case, the function prints the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to the given integer. The function uses a precomputed list `pd` to store the cumulative sum of digits for all integers from 1 to 200001, and uses this list to efficiently compute the sum of digits for each test case.
