Output State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `pd[i]` has been updated to include the value of `pd[i - 1]`, which is `pd[1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `pd` still has the same structure, with the first element being 0, and the rest being zeros except for the elements at indices corresponding to the ASCII values of characters in string `i`, which have been increased by the integer values of those characters. Additionally, `pd[2]` has been increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` has been increased by the integer value of character `j`, which is not present in string `i`. The input in stdin remains unchanged.
