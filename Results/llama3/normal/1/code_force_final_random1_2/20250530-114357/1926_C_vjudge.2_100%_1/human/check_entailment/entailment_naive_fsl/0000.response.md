Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a pre-computation approach to store the sum of digits for each number from 1 to 2 * 10^5 in an array `pd`. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the pre-computed sum for the given number `n`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* It correctly calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to 2 * 10^5.
* It handles the case where `n` is 1, in which case the sum is simply 1.
* It handles the case where `n` is a large number, such as 200000, in which case the sum is correctly calculated using the pre-computed values.
* It handles the case where `n` is a number with multiple digits, such as 1434, in which case the sum is correctly calculated by summing the digits of the number.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, with a time complexity of O(1) for each test case, which is well within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.
