Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is a string of length at least 1, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is the next character in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, and `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `pd[i]` has been increased by the integer value of the next character `j` in the string `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
