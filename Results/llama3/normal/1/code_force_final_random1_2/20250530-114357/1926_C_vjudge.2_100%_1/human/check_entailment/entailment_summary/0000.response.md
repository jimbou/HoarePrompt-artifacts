Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses a precomputation approach to store the cumulative sum of digits for all integers from 1 to 200001 in the list `pd`. This allows it to efficiently compute the sum of digits for each test case by simply looking up the corresponding value in the `pd` list.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case `n` separately. For each test case, it prints the sum of digits from 1 to `n` using the precomputed `pd` list.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading the input and producing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
