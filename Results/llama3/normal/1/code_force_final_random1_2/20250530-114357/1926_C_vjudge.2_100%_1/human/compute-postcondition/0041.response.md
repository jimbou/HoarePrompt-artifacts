Output State: **`N` is greater than 200000, `i` is a string of length at least 0, `t` is 0, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, `j` is the last character of string `i`, `_` is `t`, `n` is a list of integers, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is being printed, and `n` is assigned the value `int(stdin input)` where `stdin input` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is printed, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `t` has been decremented to 0. The loop variable `_` has been incremented to the value of `t`, which is 0. The list `pd` remains unchanged, with its elements still being printed. The variable `n` is still a list of integers, and its elements are still being printed. The stdin input has been consumed, and it is now empty.
