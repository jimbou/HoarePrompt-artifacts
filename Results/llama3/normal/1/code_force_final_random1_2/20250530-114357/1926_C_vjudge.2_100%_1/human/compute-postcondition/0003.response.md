According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is a string of at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Since `i` is 1, it is an integer, not a string, so it needs to be adjusted to a string of at least 1 character. The variable `j` is also in the loop head, so it needs to be adjusted to the first character of the string `i`.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is a string of at least 1 character, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `j` is the first character of the string `i`**
