The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than 2.
State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.**
