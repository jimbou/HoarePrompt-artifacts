Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers
Code of the loop:
for j in str(i):
    pd[i] += int(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is a string of at least 1 character, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the first character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i`, `j` is the first character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is a string of at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the first character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i` and the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the second character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the second character of string `i`, `j` is the second character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is a string of at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the first character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i`, the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the second character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the second character of string `i`, and the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the third character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the third character of string `i`, `j` is the third character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
