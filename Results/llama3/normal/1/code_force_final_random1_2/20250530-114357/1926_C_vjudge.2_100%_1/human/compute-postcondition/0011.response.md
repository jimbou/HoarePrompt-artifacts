Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `pd` at index 2 is increased by the value of `pd` at index 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `pd` still has the same structure, with the first element being 0 and the rest being zeros except for the elements at indices equal to the ASCII values of the characters in string `i`, which are increased by the integer values of those characters. The other variables, including `N`, `i`, `t`, `j`, and the input in stdin, remain unchanged.
