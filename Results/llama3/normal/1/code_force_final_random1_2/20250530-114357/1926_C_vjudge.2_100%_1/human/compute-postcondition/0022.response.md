Output State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `j` is the first character of string `i`**

In this output state, the value of `pd[i]` has been updated by adding the integer value of the first character of string `i`, which is stored in variable `j`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
