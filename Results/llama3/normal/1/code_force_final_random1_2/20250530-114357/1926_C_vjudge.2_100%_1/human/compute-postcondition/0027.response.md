Output State: **`N` is greater than 3, `i` is a string with at least `len(i)` characters, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `j` is the last character of string `i`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be a string with at least as many characters as its original length, and the list `pd` will have its elements at indices corresponding to the ASCII values of each character in `i` increased by the integer value of each character in `i`. Additionally, `pd[2]` will be increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` will be increased by the integer value of each character in `i` and by `pd[i - 1]`. The value of `j` will be the last character of the string `i`. The values of `N` and `t` remain unchanged.
