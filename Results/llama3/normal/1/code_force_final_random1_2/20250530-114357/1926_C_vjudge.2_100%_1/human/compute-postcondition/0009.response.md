Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is a string of at least `N` characters, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be a string of at least `N` characters, where `N` is greater than 1. The list `pd` will have its first element as 0, and the rest of the elements will be zeros except for the elements at indices equal to the ASCII values of each character in the string `i`, which will be increased by the integer value of each character. The variable `j` will hold the last character of the string `i`, and the other variables `t` and stdin will remain unchanged.
