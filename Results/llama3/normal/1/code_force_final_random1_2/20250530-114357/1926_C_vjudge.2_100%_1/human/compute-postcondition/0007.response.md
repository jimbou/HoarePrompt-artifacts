To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in str(i):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `j` and `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a string of at least 2 characters, and `j` is the second character of the string `i`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be a string, and `j` must be the next character in the string `i`. Since `j` is currently the second character, the next character would be the third character of the string `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is still a string of at least 2 characters (no change)
* `j` is the third character of the string `i`

The other variables `N`, `t`, `pd`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is a string of at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the first character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the first character of string `i` and the element at index equal to the ASCII value of the second character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of the second character of string `i`, `j` is the third character of the string `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**
