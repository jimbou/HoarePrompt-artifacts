You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case). Each integer is between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive.
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [(0) for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
        
    #State: N is greater than 200000, i is a string of length at least 0, t is an integer, pd is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string i which is increased by the integer value of each character of string i, and pd[2] is increased by pd[1], and pd[i] is increased by the integer value of character j, j is not present in the string i, and pd[i] is increased by pd[i - 1], and pd[i] is increased by the integer value of each character of string i, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, j is the last character of string i.
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(pd[n])
        
    #State: `N` is greater than 200000, `i` is a string of length at least 0, `t` is 0, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, `j` is the last character of string `i`, `_` is `t`, `n` is a list of integers, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is being printed, and `n` is assigned the value `int(stdin input)` where `stdin input` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is printed, and stdin is empty.

```

Return Postconditions: `N` is greater than 200000, `i` is a string of length at least 0, `t` is 0, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are zeros except for the element at index equal to the ASCII value of each character of string `i` which is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, and `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of character `j`, `j` is not present in the string `i`, and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of each character of string `i`, `j` is the last character of string `i`, `_` is `t`, `n` is a list of integers, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is being printed, and `n` is assigned the value `int(stdin input)` where `stdin input` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and the element at index `n` of the list `pd` is printed, and stdin is empty.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
