Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, idx is 5, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q lines, each containing two integers l and r, n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the integer value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the bitwise XOR of pf[0] and a[1], mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair (0): [0], i is 1**

The code block modifies the values of `idx`, `a`, and `pf`. The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 5. The value of `a[1]` is set to the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, which is the integer value of the input at index 4. The value of `pf[1]` is set to the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, which is the bitwise XOR of 0 and the integer value of `data[idx-1]`. The values of `t`, `results`, `stdin`, `n`, `q`, `mp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
