Output State: **The variable `results` now contains an additional element 'NO' at the end of the list, while all other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `v1` is still a list of values from the map `mp` with the key `pf[r]`, or an empty list if the key is not present. `v2` is still a list of values from the map `mp` with the key `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if the key is not present. `it1` is still the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, or the length of `v1` if `l` is greater than all elements in `v1`. `it2` is still the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order, minus one, or the length of `v2` minus one if `r` is greater than all elements in `v2`.**

In natural language, the code appends the string 'NO' to the end of the `results` list, leaving all other variables unchanged. The lists `v1` and `v2` remain the same, as well as the insertion points `it1` and `it2`, which were previously calculated to maintain sorted order.
