Postcondition: **The program has processed the input data and updated the results list accordingly. If the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l-1] is 0 and the conditions it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) are met, the results list contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, the results list contains the string 'NO' if the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l-1] is 0, or remains unchanged if the bitwise XOR is not 0. The program has also updated the values of t, idx, n, q, a, pf, i, mp, stdin, _, l, r, x, v1, v2, it1, and it2 according to their respective definitions.**
