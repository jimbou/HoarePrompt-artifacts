Postcondition: ***idx is incremented by 6, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 6] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value at data[idx - n - 5] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 6 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 6] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 6 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), l is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 6] before the code execution, r is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 5] before the code execution, x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[r], v2 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[l - 1], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. If x is 0, results list contains an additional string 'YES' appended at the end. Otherwise, results list contains an additional string 'NO' at the end.***
