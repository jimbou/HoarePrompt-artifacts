Output State: **idx is incremented by 2 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to 0, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), results list contains q strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the index `idx` is incremented by twice the value of `q`, which is now 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `pf`, `t`, `i`, and `mp` remain unchanged. The `results` list contains `q` strings, either 'YES' or 'NO', appended at the end, depending on the conditions inside the loop.
