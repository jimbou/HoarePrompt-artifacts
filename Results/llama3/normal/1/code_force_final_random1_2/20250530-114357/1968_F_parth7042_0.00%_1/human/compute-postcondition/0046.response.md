Output State: **`v1` is a list of values from map `mp` with key `pf[r]`, `v2` is a list of values from map `mp` with key `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one, `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x` retain their original values, and `results` now contains an additional element 'NO' appended to its original values.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their original values except for the `results` list, which now has an additional element 'NO' appended to it. The lists `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, as do the insertion points `it1` and `it2`, and the other variables `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, and `x`.
