Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, idx is 6, results is an empty list, n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the integer value of data[idx-2] and a[2] is the integer value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the bitwise XOR of pf[0] and a[1] and pf[2] is the bitwise XOR of pf[1] and a[2], i is 2. If pf[i] is not in mp, mp has four key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[2]): [2], (pf[2]): [], otherwise mp remains unchanged with three key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[2]): [2].***
