In natural language, the output state is: The value of idx is incremented by 5 times q. The value of n is still an integer greater than 1 and is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 5 * q - 1] before the code execution. The value of q is still an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 5 * q] before the code execution. The list a still contains n + 1 integers where a[1], a[2], and a[3] are the integer values at data[idx - 4 * q - 1], data[idx - 4 * q], and data[idx - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution, respectively. The list pf still contains n + 1 integers where pf[1], pf[2], and pf[3] are the integer values at data[idx - 4 * q - 1], data[idx - 4 * q - 1] XOR data[idx - 4 * q], and data[idx - 4 * q - 1] XOR data[idx - 4 * q] XOR data[idx - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution, respectively. The value of t is still greater than 0. The value of i is still 3. The dictionary mp still contains the value 0 at key 0, and the lists at keys pf[1], pf[2], and pf[i] still contain the values 1, 2, and i appended at the end, respectively. The results list still contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is still an empty string.
