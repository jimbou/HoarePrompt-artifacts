Output State: **idx is incremented by (n + 1) * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - (n + 1) * q - 1] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - (n + 1) * q] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is the integer value at data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[i] is the integer value at data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 1] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - i * q] before the code execution XOR ... XOR the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 1] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, mp[pf[i]] contains the value i appended at the end, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The index `idx` has been incremented by `(n + 1) * q`, where `n` is the number of iterations and `q` is a constant.
* The value of `n` remains the same as the initial value, which is an integer greater than 0.
* The value of `q` remains the same as the initial value, which is an integer.
* The list `a` now contains `n + 1` integers, where each integer at index `i` is the value at `data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 1]` before the code execution.
* The list `pf` now contains `n + 1` integers, where each integer at index `i` is the XOR of the integers at `data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 1]`, `data[idx - i * q]`, ..., `data[idx - 2 * q - 1]` before the code execution.
* The value of `t` remains greater than 0.
* The value of `i` is now `n`, which is the number of iterations.
* The dictionary `mp` now contains `n + 1` key-value pairs, where each key is a prefix sum `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing the index `i`.
* The list `results` remains unchanged, containing `q + 1` strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, with the last string being an empty string.
