To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, so we can only adjust the state of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `i` is 2, `mp` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[i]): [1]**
