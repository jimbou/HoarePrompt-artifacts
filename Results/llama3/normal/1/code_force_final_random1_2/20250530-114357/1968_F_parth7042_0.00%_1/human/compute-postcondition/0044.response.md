Output State: **v1 is a list of values from map mp with key pf[r], v2 is a list of values from map mp with key pf[l - 1], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, all other variables (q, l, r, idx, x, results) retain their original values.**

In this output state, the values of v1 and v2 are determined by the map mp and the keys pf[r] and pf[l - 1], respectively. The values of it1 and it2 are calculated using the bisect_left function, which returns the insertion point for l in v1 and r in v2 to maintain sorted order. The value of it2 is then decremented by 1. All other variables, including q, l, r, idx, x, and results, retain their original values as they are not modified by the code.
