Output State: **idx is incremented by 2, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value at data[idx - n - 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 2 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, results list contains two additional strings: an empty string at the end and 'YES' appended after that, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), l is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, r is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, and the current value of x is 0, which is equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1].**

The code appends 'YES' to the results list and then continues to the next iteration of the loop. This means that the results list now contains an additional string 'YES' appended after the empty string that was already present at the end. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.
