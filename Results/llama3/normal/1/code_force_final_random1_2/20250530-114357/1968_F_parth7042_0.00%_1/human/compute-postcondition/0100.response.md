Output State: **idx is incremented by 2 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 zeros, pf is a list of n + 1 zeros, t is greater than 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to the value at `data[idx]` before the code execution, and the value of `q` is updated to the value at `data[idx + 1]` before the code execution. The list `a` is initialized with `n + 1` zeros, and the list `pf` is also initialized with `n + 1` zeros. The dictionary `mp` is updated to contain only one key-value pair, where the key is 0 and the value is 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
