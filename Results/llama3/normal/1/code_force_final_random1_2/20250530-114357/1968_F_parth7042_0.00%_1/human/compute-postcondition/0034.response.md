Output State: **The results list has been appended with the string 'YES'. The variable idx remains incremented by 2. The variable x remains equal to the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]. The values of t, n, q, a, pf, i, mp, stdin, _, v1, v2, it1, and it2 remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the results list has been updated with the string 'YES', indicating a positive outcome. The variable idx, which was previously incremented by 2, retains its new value. The variable x, which was calculated as the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], remains unchanged. All other variables, including t, n, q, a, pf, i, mp, stdin, _, v1, v2, it1, and it2, retain their original values, as they were not modified by the code.
