Output State: **idx is incremented by 2, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value at data[idx - n - 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 2 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), l is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, r is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, and x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1].**

The code execution results in the following changes: idx is incremented by 2, l is assigned the value at data[idx] before the code execution, r is assigned the value at data[idx + 1] before the code execution, and x is assigned the value of pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1]. The values of n, q, a, pf, t, results, i, and mp remain unchanged.
