Output State: **The variable v1 is now a list of values from the map mp with the key pf[r], or an empty list if the key is not present. The variable v2 is now a list of values from the map mp with the key pf[l - 1], or an empty list if the key is not present. The variable it1 is now the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, or the length of v1 if l is greater than all elements in v1. The variable it2 is now the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order, minus one, or the length of v2 minus one if r is greater than all elements in v2. The variable results now contains the string 'YES' appended to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables related to v1, v2, it1, and it2 remain the same as before, but the variable results now has the string 'YES' added to its previous value.
