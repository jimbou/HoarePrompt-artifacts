To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair (0): [0], `i` is 1**
