Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, idx is 2, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q lines, each containing two integers l and r.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    q = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = {(0): [0]}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        if pf[i] not in mp:
            mp[pf[i]] = []
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[idx])
        r = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
        v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
        it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    results.append('')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The results list contains an additional empty string at the end, and all other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: idx is incremented by 2 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to 0, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: idx is incremented by 2 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - (n + 1) * q - 3] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - (n + 1) * q - 2] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is the integer value at data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 3] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[i] is the integer value at data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 3] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - i * q - 2] before the code execution XOR ... XOR the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 3] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, mp[pf[i]] contains the value i appended at the end, results list contains q + q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is 'YES' if it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l. Otherwise, the last string in results is 'NO', _ is q - 1, l is the integer value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, r is the integer value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, x is pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of integers from mp[pf[r]], v2 is a list of integers from mp[pf[l - 1]], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
