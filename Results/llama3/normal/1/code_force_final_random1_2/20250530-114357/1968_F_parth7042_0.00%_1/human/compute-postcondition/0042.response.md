Output State: **v1, v2, it1, and it2 remain unchanged, retaining their original values based on the map mp and the keys pf[r] and pf[l - 1], results is updated to include 'YES', q is greater than 1, l is the integer value at data[idx], r is the integer value at data[idx + 1], idx is incremented by 2, x is the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

In this output state, the values of v1, v2, it1, and it2 remain the same as they were before the code execution, as they are not modified by the code. The results list is updated to include the string 'YES'. The value of q remains greater than 1, as it is not modified by the code. The values of l and r are updated to the integer values at data[idx] and data[idx + 1], respectively, and idx is incremented by 2. The value of x is updated to the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].
