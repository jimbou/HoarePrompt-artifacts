Postcondition: ***idx is incremented by 2, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - (n + 1) * q - 3] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - (n + 1) * q - 2] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is the integer value at data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 3] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[i] is the integer value at data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 3] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - i * q - 2] before the code execution XOR ... XOR the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 3] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, mp[pf[i]] contains the value i appended at the end, results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise it is an empty string, _ is 0, l is the integer value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, r is the integer value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, x is the integer value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution XOR ... XOR the integer value at data[idx - r * q - 2] before the code execution, v1 is a list of integers from mp[pf[r]], v2 is a list of integers from mp[pf[l - 1]], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. Either it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or v1[it1] is greater than r, or v2[it2] is less than l.***
