Postcondition: ***v1 is a list of values from map mp with key pf[r], v2 is a list of values from map mp with key pf[l - 1], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and all other variables (q, l, r, idx, x) retain their original values. If it1 is less than the length of v1 and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than or equal to r and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, then results has been appended with the string 'YES'. Otherwise, results now contains an additional element 'NO' appended to its original values.***
