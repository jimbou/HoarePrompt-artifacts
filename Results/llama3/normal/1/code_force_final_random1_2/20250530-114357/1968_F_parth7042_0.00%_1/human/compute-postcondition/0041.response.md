Output State: **v1, v2, it1, and it2 remain unchanged, retaining their original values based on the map mp and the keys pf[r] and pf[l - 1], results is updated based on the conditions, q is greater than 1, l is the integer value at data[idx], r is the integer value at data[idx + 1], idx is incremented by 2, x is the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1].**

In this final state, the values of `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are preserved as they were before the code execution, based on the map `mp` and the keys `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The variable `results` has been updated according to the conditions specified in the code. The value of `q` remains greater than 1. The variables `l` and `r` have been assigned the integer values at `data[idx]` and `data[idx + 1]`, respectively. The index `idx` has been incremented by 2. Finally, the variable `x` has been assigned the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
