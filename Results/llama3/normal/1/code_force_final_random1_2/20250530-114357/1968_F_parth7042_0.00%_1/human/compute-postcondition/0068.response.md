Output State: **idx is incremented by 5, n is an integer greater than 2, equal to the value at data[idx - 4] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, a[2] is equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, and a[3] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, pf[2] is equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution XOR the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, and pf[3] is equal to pf[2] XOR the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is 3, if pf[i] is not in mp, then mp[pf[2]] is an empty list, otherwise mp[pf[2]] contains the value 2 and 3, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

The code appends the value of i (which is 3) to the list mp[pf[i]]. Since pf[i] is equal to pf[3], which is pf[2] XOR the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, and pf[2] is equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution XOR the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, the value of pf[i] is the XOR of the values at data[idx - 3], data[idx - 2], and data[idx - 1] before the code execution. Therefore, the list mp[pf[2]] now contains the values 2 and 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
