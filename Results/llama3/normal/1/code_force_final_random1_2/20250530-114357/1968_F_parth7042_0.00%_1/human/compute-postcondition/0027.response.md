Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, idx is n+6, results is a list containing the string 'YES' if the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l-1] is 0, otherwise results remains an empty list, n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the integer value of data[4], a[2] is the integer value of data[5], ..., a[n] is the integer value of data[n+3], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the bitwise XOR of pf[0] and a[1], pf[2] is the bitwise XOR of pf[1] and a[2], ..., pf[n] is the bitwise XOR of pf[n-1] and a[n], i is n, mp has n+1 key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[1]): [1], (pf[2]): [2], ..., (pf[n]): [n], stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q-n-1 lines, each containing two integers l and r, _ is 0, l is the integer value of data[n+4], r is the integer value of data[n+5], x is the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l-1], v1 is a list of indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list of indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and the current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l.**
