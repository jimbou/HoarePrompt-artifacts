Output State: **idx is incremented by n + 1, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n + 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is n, and mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1).**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), and in each iteration, it updates the values of idx, n, q, a, pf, and mp accordingly. The values of t and results remain unchanged throughout the loop. The final state of mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list containing the index i where that prefix XOR value was encountered.
