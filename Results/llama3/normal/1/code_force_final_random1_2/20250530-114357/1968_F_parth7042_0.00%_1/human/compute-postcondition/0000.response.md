Output State: **t is an integer, idx is 2, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q lines, each containing two integers l and r.**

The code reads the first line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `data`. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `t`. The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list. The rest of the input remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.
