The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, t must be decreased by 1.
State: **idx is incremented by 2 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to 0, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t is greater than 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string**
