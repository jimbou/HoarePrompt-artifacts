Output State: **idx is incremented by 6, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 6] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value at data[idx - n - 5] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 6 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 6] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 6 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), l is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 6] before the code execution, r is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 5] before the code execution, x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[r], v2 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[l - 1], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1, and results list contains an additional string 'NO' appended to the end of the list that already contains 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise 'NO'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the results list now contains an additional string 'NO' appended to the end of the list.
