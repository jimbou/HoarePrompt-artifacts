Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: idx is incremented by n + 1, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n + 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is n, and mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *idx is incremented by 2, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value at data[idx - n - 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 2 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), l is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, r is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[r], v2 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[l - 1], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. If x is 0, then either it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, in which case results list contains an additional string 'YES' appended at the end, or it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or v1[it1] is greater than r, or v2[it2] is less than l, in which case results list contains an additional string 'NO' at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *idx is incremented by 4, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 4 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), l is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 4] before the code execution, r is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[r], v2 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[l - 1], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. If it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, then results list contains an additional string 'YES' appended at the end. Otherwise, results list contains an additional string 'NO' at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *idx is incremented by 6, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 6] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value at data[idx - n - 5] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 6 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 6] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 6 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), l is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 6] before the code execution, r is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 5] before the code execution, x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[r], v2 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[l - 1], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. If it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l), then results list contains two strings 'YES' 'NO' if x is 0, otherwise 'NO' 'YES'. Otherwise, results list contains an additional string 'NO' appended to the end of the list that already contains 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
