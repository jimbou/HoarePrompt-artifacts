Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, idx is 5, results is an empty list, n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the integer value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the bitwise XOR of pf[0] and a[1], i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q lines, each containing two integers l and r. If pf[i] is not in mp, then mp is a dictionary with two key-value pairs (0): [0] and (pf[i]): [].***
