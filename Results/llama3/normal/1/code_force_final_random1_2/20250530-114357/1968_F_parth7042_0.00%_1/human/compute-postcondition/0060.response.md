Output State: **idx is incremented by 4, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution and a[2] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution and pf[2] is equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution XOR the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is 2, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
