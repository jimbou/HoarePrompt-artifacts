Output State: **idx is incremented by 3, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, mp is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing a single zero, and another key is pf[1] and the value is an empty list, t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the only change is that the dictionary mp now has an additional key-value pair where the key is pf[1] and the value is an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.
