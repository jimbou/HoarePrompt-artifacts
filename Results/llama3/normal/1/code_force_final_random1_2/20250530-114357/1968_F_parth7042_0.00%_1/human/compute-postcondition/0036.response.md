Output State: **The variable v1 is now a list of values from the map mp with the key pf[r], or an empty list if the key is not present. The variable v2 is now a list of values from the map mp with the key pf[l - 1], or an empty list if the key is not present. The variable it1 is now the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, or the length of v1 if l is greater than all elements in v1. The variable it2 is now the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order, minus one, or the length of v2 minus one if r is greater than all elements in v2. All other variables remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the variables v1 and v2 have been updated to store lists of values from the map mp, based on the keys pf[r] and pf[l - 1], respectively. The variables it1 and it2 have been updated to store the insertion points for l and r in v1 and v2, respectively, to maintain sorted order. All other variables, including l, r, idx, x, t, n, q, a, pf, i, mp, stdin, _, and the results list, remain unchanged.
