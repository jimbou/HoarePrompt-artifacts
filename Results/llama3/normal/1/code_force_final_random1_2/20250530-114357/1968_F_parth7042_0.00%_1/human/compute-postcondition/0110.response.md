Postcondition: ***idx is incremented by 4 * q, n is an integer greater than 1, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4 * q] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution and a[2] is the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution and pf[2] is the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is 2, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, if pf[i] is not in mp, mp[pf[i]] contains an empty list and mp[pf[1]] contains a list with the value 1 appended at the end, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string. If pf[i] is not in mp, mp[pf[2]] contains an empty list.***
