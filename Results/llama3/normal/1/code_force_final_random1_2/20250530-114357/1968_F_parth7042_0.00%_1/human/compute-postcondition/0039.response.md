Postcondition: **The variables `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged, retaining their original values based on the map `mp` and the keys `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The variable `results` is updated based on the conditions: if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.**
