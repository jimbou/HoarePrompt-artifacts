Postcondition: ***v1, v2, it1, and it2 remain unchanged, retaining their original values based on the map mp and the keys pf[r] and pf[l - 1], q is greater than 1, l is the integer value at data[idx], r is the integer value at data[idx + 1], idx is incremented by 2, x is the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]. If x is equal to 0, results is updated to include 'YES'.***
