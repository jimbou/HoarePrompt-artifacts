Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is `n+4`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[5]`, ..., `a[n]` is the integer value of `data[n+3]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`, ..., `pf[n]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[n-1]` and `a[n]`, `i` is `n`, `mp` has `n+1` key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[1]): [1], (pf[2]): [2], ..., (pf[n]): [n], stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q-n` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The variable `t` remains an integer greater than 0.
* The variable `idx` has been incremented by `n` and is now `n+4`.
* The list `results` is still empty.
* The variable `n` remains an integer greater than 0.
* The variable `q` remains an integer.
* The list `a` has been populated with `n` integers, where each integer is the value of the corresponding input from `data`.
* The list `pf` has been populated with `n` integers, where each integer is the bitwise XOR of the previous integer and the corresponding integer in `a`.
* The variable `i` has reached its final value of `n`.
* The dictionary `mp` has been populated with `n+1` key-value pairs, where each key is a prefix XOR value and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.
* The stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q-n` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.
