Postcondition: ***idx is incremented by 4, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 4 + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), l is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 4] before the code execution, r is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[r], v2 is a list of values from mp where the key is pf[l - 1], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1. If x is 0, then either it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, in which case results list contains an additional string 'YES' appended at the end, or it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or v1[it1] is greater than r, or v2[it2] is less than l, in which case results list contains an additional string 'NO' at the end. Otherwise, results list remains unchanged.***
