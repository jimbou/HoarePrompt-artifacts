Output: **idx is incremented by 2 * q * t, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q * t] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to 0, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q * t + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q * t] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q * t + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), results list contains t * q + t strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string, and the following is printed: a string containing t * q + t lines where each line is either 'YES' or 'NO' and the last line is an empty string.**
