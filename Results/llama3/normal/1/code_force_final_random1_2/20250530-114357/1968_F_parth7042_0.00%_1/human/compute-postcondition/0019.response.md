Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is `n+4`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[5]`, ..., `a[n]` is the integer value of `data[n+3]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`, ..., `pf[n]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[n-1]` and `a[n]`, `i` is `n`, `mp` has `n+1` key-value pairs where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows: `t` remains an integer greater than 0, `idx` has moved `n` positions forward in the input data, `results` is still an empty list, `n` and `q` remain unchanged, `a` has been populated with `n` integers from the input data, `pf` contains the prefix XOR values for each index in `a`, `i` has reached its final value of `n`, and `mp` has been populated with `n+1` key-value pairs, where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.
