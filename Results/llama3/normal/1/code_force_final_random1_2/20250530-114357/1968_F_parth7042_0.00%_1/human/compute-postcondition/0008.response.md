Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `i` is 1, `mp` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[i]): [1], stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q-1` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.**

In this output state, the value of `mp[pf[i]]` has been updated to include the value `i`, which is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one line has been consumed to update the value of `mp[pf[i]]`.
