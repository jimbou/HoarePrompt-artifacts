This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer t, two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q queries with two integers l and r. It processes each test case by calculating the prefix XOR of the list of integers and storing the indices of each XOR value in a dictionary. Then, for each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the given range [l, r] with a XOR value equal to the XOR of the prefix values at indices l-1 and r. If such a subarray exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the results list, which contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, followed by an empty string.
