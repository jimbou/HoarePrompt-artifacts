Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is `n+4`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[5]`, ..., `a[n]` is the integer value of `data[n+3]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`, ..., `pf[n]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[n-1]` and `a[n]`, `i` is `n`, `mp` has `n+1` key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[1]): [1], (pf[2]): [2], ..., (pf[n]): [n], stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q-n` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The variable `t` remains an integer greater than 0.
* The variable `idx` has been incremented by `n` and is now `n+4`.
* The list `results` is still empty.
* The variable `n` remains an integer greater than 0.
* The variable `q` remains an integer.
* The list `a` has been populated with `n` integers, where each integer is the value of the corresponding input from `data`.
* The list `pf` has been populated with `n` integers, where each integer is the bitwise XOR of the previous integer and the corresponding integer in `a`.
* The variable `i` has reached its final value of `n`.
* The dictionary `mp` has been populated with `n+1` key-value pairs, where each key is a prefix XOR value and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.
* The stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q-n` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program has processed the input data and updated the results list accordingly. If the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l-1] is 0 and the conditions it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) are met, the results list contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, the results list contains the string 'NO' if the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l-1] is 0, or remains unchanged if the bitwise XOR is not 0. The program has also updated the values of t, idx, n, q, a, pf, i, mp, stdin, _, l, r, x, v1, v2, it1, and it2 according to their respective definitions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The variables `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged, retaining their original values based on the map `mp` and the keys `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The variable `results` is updated based on the conditions: if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *v1 is a list of values from map mp with key pf[r], v2 is a list of values from map mp with key pf[l - 1], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and all other variables (q, l, r, idx, x) retain their original values. If it1 is less than the length of v1 and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than or equal to r and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, then results has been appended with the string 'YES'. Otherwise, results now contains an additional element 'NO' appended to its original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
