Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, idx is 4, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q lines, each containing two integers l and r, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair (0): [0]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `i` is 1, `mp` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[i]): [1], stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q-1` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is 6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[idx-2]` and `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]` and `pf[2]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`, `i` is 2, `mp` has four key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[2]): [2, 2], (pf[2]): [], otherwise mp remains unchanged with three key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[2]): [2].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is 7, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[5]`, and `a[3]` is the integer value of `data[6]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`, and `pf[3]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[2]` and `a[3]`, `i` is 3, `mp` has four key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[2]): [2, 2, 3], (pf[3]): [3].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
