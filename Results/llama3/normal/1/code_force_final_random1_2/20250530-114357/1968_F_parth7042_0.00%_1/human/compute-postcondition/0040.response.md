The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again q must be greater than 1.
State: **`v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged, retaining their original values based on the map `mp` and the keys `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `results` is updated based on the conditions, q is greater than 1**
