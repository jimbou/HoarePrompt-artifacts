Output State: **idx is incremented by 2 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to 0, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t remains greater than 1, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that an empty string has been appended to the results list, increasing the number of strings in the list by 1.
