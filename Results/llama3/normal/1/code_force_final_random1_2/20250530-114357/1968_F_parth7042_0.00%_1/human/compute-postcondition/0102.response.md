Output State: **idx is incremented by 3 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3 * q] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 1] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is 1, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string**

The code block modifies the values of `idx`, `a`, and `pf`. The first line assigns the integer value at `data[idx]` to `a[i]`, which is `a[1]` since `i` is 1. The second line increments `idx` by 1. The third line assigns the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[i - 1]` (which is `pf[0]`) and `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) to `pf[i]` (which is `pf[1]`). 

Note that the value of `n` is not modified by the code, but its relationship with `idx` and `data` changes due to the increment of `idx`. Similarly, the values of `q`, `t`, `i`, `mp`, and `results` are not modified by the code.
