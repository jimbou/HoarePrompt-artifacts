Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: idx is incremented by 2 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q + 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 zeros, pf is a list of n + 1 zeros, t is greater than 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: idx is incremented by 3 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3 * q] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 1] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is 1, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0 and if pf[i] is not in mp, mp[pf[i]] contains an empty list and mp[pf[1]] contains a list with the value 1 appended at the end, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: idx is incremented by 4 * q, n is an integer greater than 1, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 4 * q] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution and a[2] is the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution and pf[2] is the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - 3 * q] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is 2, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, mp[pf[i]] contains the value i appended at the end, mp[pf[1]] contains a list with the value 1 appended at the end, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: idx is incremented by 5 * q, n is an integer greater than 1, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 5 * q - 1] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 5 * q] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution, a[2] is the integer value at data[idx - 4 * q] before the code execution, and a[3] is the integer value at data[idx - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution, pf[2] is the integer value at data[idx - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - 4 * q] before the code execution, and pf[3] is the integer value at data[idx - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - 4 * q] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - 4 * q - 1] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is 3, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, mp[pf[i]] contains the value i appended at the end, mp[pf[1]] contains a list with the value 1 appended at the end, mp[pf[2]] contains a list with the value 2 appended at the end, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
