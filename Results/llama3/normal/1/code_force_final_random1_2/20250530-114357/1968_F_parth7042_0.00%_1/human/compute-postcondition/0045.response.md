Output State: **`v1` is a list of values from map `mp` with key `pf[r]`, `v2` is a list of values from map `mp` with key `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one, `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x` retain their original values, and `results` has been appended with the string 'YES'.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their original values except for the `results` list, which now contains the string 'YES' as its last element.
