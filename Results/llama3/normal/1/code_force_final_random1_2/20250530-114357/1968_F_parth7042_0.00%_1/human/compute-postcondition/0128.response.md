Postcondition: ***idx is incremented by 2, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - (n + 1) * q - 3] before the code execution, q is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - (n + 1) * q - 2] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is the integer value at data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 3] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[i] is the integer value at data[idx - (i + 1) * q - 3] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - i * q - 2] before the code execution XOR ... XOR the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 3] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, mp[pf[i]] contains the value i appended at the end, results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is 'YES' if it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l. Otherwise, the last string in results is 'NO', _ is 0, l is the integer value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, r is the integer value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, x is the integer value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution XOR the integer value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution XOR ... XOR the integer value at data[idx - r * q - 2] before the code execution, v1 is a list of integers from mp[pf[r]], v2 is a list of integers from mp[pf[l - 1]], it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus 1.***
