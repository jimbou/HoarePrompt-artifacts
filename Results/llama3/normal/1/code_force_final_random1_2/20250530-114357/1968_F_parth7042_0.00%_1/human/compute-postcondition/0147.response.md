Output State: **idx is incremented by 2 * q * t, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q * t] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to 0, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[i] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q * t + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(1, n + 1), pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q * t] before the code execution and pf[i] is equal to pf[i - 1] XOR the value at data[idx - n - 2 * q * t + i - 1] before the code execution for all i in range(2, n + 1), t is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where mp[pf[i]] contains the value i for all i in range(1, n + 1), results list contains t * q + t strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The index `idx` is incremented by `2 * q * t`, where `q` is the number of queries and `t` is the number of test cases.
- The variable `n` is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at `data[idx - n - 2 * q * t]` before the code execution.
- The variable `q` is an integer equal to 0.
- The list `a` contains `n + 1` integers, where each integer `a[i]` is equal to the value at `data[idx - n - 2 * q * t + i - 1]` before the code execution for all `i` in range(1, `n + 1`).
- The list `pf` contains `n + 1` integers, where `pf[1]` is equal to the value at `data[idx - n - 2 * q * t]` before the code execution, and `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1]` XOR the value at `data[idx - n - 2 * q * t + i - 1]` before the code execution for all `i` in range(2, `n + 1`).
- The variable `t` is 0.
- The variable `i` is `n`.
- The dictionary `mp` contains the value `i` for all `i` in range(1, `n + 1`), where `mp[pf[i]]` contains the value `i`.
- The list `results` contains `t * q + t` strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in `results` is an empty string.
