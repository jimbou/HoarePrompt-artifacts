The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is 6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[idx-2]` and `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]` and `pf[2]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`, `i` is 3, `mp` has four key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[2]): [2, 2], (pf[2]): [], otherwise mp remains unchanged with three key-value pairs (0): [0], (pf[2]): [2]**
