Postcondition: **The program has processed the input data and updated the results list accordingly. The variable l is equal to the integer value of data[idx], and the variable r is equal to the integer value of data[idx + 1]. The variable idx has been incremented by 2. The variable x is equal to the bitwise XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]. The values of t, n, q, a, pf, i, mp, stdin, _, v1, v2, it1, and it2 remain unchanged. If x is equal to 0, the results list has been appended with the string 'YES'.**
