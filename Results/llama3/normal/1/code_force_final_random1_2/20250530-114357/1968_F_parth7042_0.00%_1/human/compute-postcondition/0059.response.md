To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **idx is incremented by 3, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is 2, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
