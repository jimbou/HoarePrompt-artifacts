Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: idx is incremented by 2, n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx + 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 zeros, pf is a list of n + 1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing a single zero, t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, and all other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: idx is incremented by 3, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If pf[i] is not in mp, mp is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing a single zero, and another key is pf[1] and the value is a list containing 1. Otherwise, mp remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: idx is incremented by 4, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution and a[2] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution and pf[2] is equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution XOR the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is 2, mp[pf[2]] contains the value 2, and all other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: idx is incremented by 5, n is an integer greater than 2, equal to the value at data[idx - 4] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, a[2] is equal to the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, and a[3] is equal to the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution, pf[2] is equal to the value at data[idx - 3] before the code execution XOR the value at data[idx - 2] before the code execution, and pf[3] is equal to pf[2] XOR the value at data[idx - 1] before the code execution, t remains greater than 1, results list contains an additional empty string at the end, i is 3, if pf[i] is not in mp, then mp[pf[2]] is an empty list, otherwise mp[pf[2]] contains the value 2 and 3, and all other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
