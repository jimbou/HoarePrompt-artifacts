Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the integer value of data[`idx-1`], `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the bitwise XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs (0): [0] and (`pf[i]`): [], `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.**

In this output state, the value of `mp[pf[i]]` has been updated to an empty list `[]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with the specified inputs.
