Output State: **idx is incremented by 3 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3 * q] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 1] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is 1, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0 and mp[pf[i]] contains an empty list, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the dictionary mp now has an additional key-value pair where the key is the current value of pf[i] and the value is an empty list.
