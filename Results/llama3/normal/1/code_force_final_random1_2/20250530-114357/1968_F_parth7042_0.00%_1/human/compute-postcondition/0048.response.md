Output State: The variable `t` remains an integer greater than 0, the variable `idx` has been incremented by `2*q` and is now `n+4+2*q`, the list `results` contains `q` strings, each of which is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions in the loop body, the variable `n` remains an integer greater than 0, the variable `q` remains an integer, the list `a` has been populated with `n` integers, where each integer is the value of the corresponding input from `data`, the list `pf` has been populated with `n` integers, where each integer is the bitwise XOR of the previous integer and the corresponding integer in `a`, the variable `i` has reached its final value of `n`, the dictionary `mp` has been populated with `n+1` key-value pairs, where each key is a prefix XOR value and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, and the stdin contains multiple test cases with 3 inputs: two integers `n` and `q`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q-n` lines, each containing two integers `l` and `r`.
