Postcondition: **idx is incremented by 3 * q, n is an integer greater than 0, equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3 * q - 1] before the code execution, q is an integer equal to the value at data[idx - n - 3 * q] before the code execution, a is a list of n + 1 integers where a[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 1] before the code execution, pf is a list of n + 1 integers where pf[1] is the integer value at data[idx - 2 * q - 1] before the code execution, t is greater than 0, i is 1, mp is a dictionary where mp[0] contains the value 0, and results list contains q + 1 strings 'YES' or 'NO' appended at the end, and the last string in results is an empty string. The current value of pf[i] is not in mp.**
