Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains three space-separated integers (a, b, and c). It then processes each test case by adding the value of c to b, and prints either the tuple (a - -b // 3, -1) if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 if c is less than b % 3, repeating this process t times. The function does not modify the original values of a, b, or c, and does not return any value, only printing the results of the calculations.**
