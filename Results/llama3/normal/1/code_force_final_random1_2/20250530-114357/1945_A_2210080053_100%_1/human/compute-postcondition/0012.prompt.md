Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains three space-separated integers a, b, and c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
    b += c
    print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer, b is an integer equal to its original value plus c, c is an integer, s is a string containing three space-separated integers a, b, and c, stdin contains at least one line, and this is printed: either the tuple (a - -b // 3, -1) if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 if c is less than b % 3

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is an integer equal to its original value, b is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times c, c is an integer equal to its original value, s is a string containing three space-separated integers a, b, and c, stdin contains at least one line, and either the tuple (a - -b // 3, -1) was printed if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 was printed if c is less than b % 3, and this is printed: either (a - -b // 3, -1) if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 if c is less than b % 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is an integer equal to its original value, b is an integer equal to its original value plus 3 times c, c is an integer equal to its original value, s is a string containing three space-separated integers a, b, and c, stdin contains at least one line, and either the tuple (a - -b // 3, -1) was printed if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 was printed if c is less than b % 3, and this is printed: either (a - -b // 3, -1) if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 if c is less than b % 3, and this is printed: either (a - -b // 3, -1) if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 if c is less than b % 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
