Output State: **a is an integer equal to its original value, b is an integer equal to its original value plus t times c, c is an integer equal to its original value, s is a string containing three space-separated integers a, b, and c, stdin contains at least t lines, and either the tuple (a - -b // 3, -1) was printed t times if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 was printed t times if c is less than b % 3.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of 'a' remains the same as its initial value, the value of 'b' is its original value plus 't' times 'c', and the value of 'c' remains unchanged. The string 's' still contains three space-separated integers 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The standard input 'stdin' contains at least 't' lines. The loop has printed either the tuple (a - -b // 3, -1) 't' times if 'c' is greater than or equal to 'b' modulo 3, or -1 't' times if 'c' is less than 'b' modulo 3.
