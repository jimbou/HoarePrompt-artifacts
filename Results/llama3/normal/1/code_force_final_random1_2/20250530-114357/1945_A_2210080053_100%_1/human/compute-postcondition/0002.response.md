Let's break down the print statement step by step:

1. `a - -b // 3`: This expression subtracts the result of `-b // 3` from `a`. The `-b // 3` part performs integer division of `-b` by 3, which will result in an integer value. The `-` sign in front of `b` will change the sign of the result, so if `b` is positive, `-b // 3` will be negative, and vice versa.

Since `b` is an integer equal to its original value plus `c`, we can rewrite `b` as `b = b_original + c`. Substituting this into the expression, we get:

`a - -(b_original + c) // 3`

2. `c < b % 3`: This expression checks whether `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3. The `%` operator computes the remainder of the division of `b` by 3.

Since `b` is an integer equal to its original value plus `c`, we can rewrite `b` as `b = b_original + c`. Substituting this into the expression, we get:

`c < (b_original + c) % 3`

3. The entire print statement is a tuple with two elements: `(a - -b // 3, -1)`. The `[c < b % 3]` part is an indexing operation that selects one of the two elements based on the condition `c < b % 3`.

If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the first element of the tuple is selected: `a - -b // 3`. If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the second element of the tuple is selected: `-1`.

Now, let's describe the output:

Output: **either (a - -(b_original + c) // 3) or -1, depending on whether c is less than the remainder of (b_original + c) divided by 3**

Note that we can't provide a more precise numerical value for the output because the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `b_original` are not specified. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables and conditions.
