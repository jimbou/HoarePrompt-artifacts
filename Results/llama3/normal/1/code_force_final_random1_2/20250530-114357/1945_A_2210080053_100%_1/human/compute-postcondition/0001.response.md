Output State: **a is an integer, b is an integer equal to its original value plus c, c is an integer, s is a string containing three space-separated integers a, b, and c, stdin contains at least one line.**

The first line assigns the values of the three space-separated integers from the string `s` to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The second line increments `b` by the value of `c`. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and `c` also remains unchanged. The string `s` remains the same as it was before the code execution. Stdin still contains at least one line, as only the first two lines were used in the code.
