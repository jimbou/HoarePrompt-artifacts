#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains three space-separated integers a, b, and c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
        
        b += c
        
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
        
    #State: a is an integer equal to its original value, b is an integer equal to its original value plus t times c, c is an integer equal to its original value, s is a string containing three space-separated integers a, b, and c, stdin contains at least t lines, and either the tuple (a - -b // 3, -1) was printed t times if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 was printed t times if c is less than b % 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains three space-separated integers (a, b, and c). It then processes each test case by adding the value of c to b, and prints either the tuple (a - -b // 3, -1) if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 if c is less than b % 3, repeating this process t times. The function does not modify the original values of a, b, or c, and does not return any value, only printing the results of the calculations.
