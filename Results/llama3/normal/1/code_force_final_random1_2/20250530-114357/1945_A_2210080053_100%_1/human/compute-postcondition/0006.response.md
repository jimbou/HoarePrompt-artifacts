Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is a conditional expression that uses the ternary operator `[]` to select one of two values based on the condition `c < b % 3`.

The condition `c < b % 3` is evaluated as follows:

* `b % 3` calculates the remainder of `b` divided by 3.
* `c` is compared to this remainder.

If `c` is less than the remainder, the condition is true, and the expression evaluates to `-1`.

If `c` is greater than or equal to the remainder, the condition is false, and the expression evaluates to `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.

Now, let's analyze the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`:

* `a` is an integer equal to its original value.
* `b` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times `c`.
* `c` is an integer equal to its original value.

Since `a` and `c` are equal to their original values, we can't determine their exact values without more information. However, we can describe their values using the given information.

The value of `b` is equal to its original value plus 2 times `c`, which means it is dependent on the value of `c`.

Now, let's describe the output:

Output: **either (a - -b // 3, -1) (where a is the original value of a, b is the original value of b plus 2 times c, and c is the original value of c) if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 if c is less than b % 3**
