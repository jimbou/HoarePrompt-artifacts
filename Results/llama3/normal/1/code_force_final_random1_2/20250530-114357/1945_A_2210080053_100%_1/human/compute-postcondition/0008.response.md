The only variable in the loop head is variable  s, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin. If stdin contains at least two lines the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains at least one line. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain at least two lines.
State: **a is an integer equal to its original value, b is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times c, c is an integer equal to its original value, s is a string containing three space-separated integers a, b, and c, stdin contains at least two lines, and either the tuple (a - -b // 3, -1) was printed if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 was printed if c is less than b % 3, and this is printed: either (a - -b // 3, -1) if c is greater than or equal to b % 3, or -1 if c is less than b % 3**
