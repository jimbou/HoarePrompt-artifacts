Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list containing one integer missing which is the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 2 characters, `prob` is the second character in the string `a`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 2 and all other elements are 0, except for the element at index `ord(first_char) - ord('A')` which is 1**

The value of `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1, so the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in the list `freq` is now 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.
