Output State: **t is at least 1, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', freq is a list of 7 zeros**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code extracts the values of `n`, `m`, and `a` from the `_` index of the `test_cases` list and assigns them to the corresponding variables. The `freq` list is initialized with 7 zeros, ready to store frequency counts of characters in the string `a`.
