Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of at least 1 character from 'A' to 'G', `prob` is the second character in the string `a`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by 1, and the value at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in `freq` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value in the `freq` list at the index corresponding to the second character of the string `a` is incremented by 1.
