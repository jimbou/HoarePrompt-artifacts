To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `prob` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more characters in the string `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 characters, and `prob` is the second character in the string `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 characters, and `prob` must be the third character in the string `a`.

Additionally, the state of `freq` needs to be adjusted to reflect the updated frequency of characters in the string `a`. Since `prob` is now the third character in the string `a`, the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the third character in the string `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list containing one integer which is the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 3 characters, `prob` is the third character in the string `a`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element is 0 except for the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the first character in the string `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A', which is 1, the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the second character in the string `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A', which is 2, and the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the third character in the string `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A', which is 1**
