Output State: `t` is at least 2, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list containing one integer missing which is the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `prob` is the last character in the string `a`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is the frequency of character `char` in the string `a`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows: `t` remains at least 2, `test_cases` remains a list of tuples with two integers and a string, `results` remains a list with one integer missing, `n` and `m` remain integers between 1 and 50, and 1 and 5 respectively, `a` remains a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `prob` is now the last character in the string `a`, and `freq` is a list where each element at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` represents the frequency of character `char` in the string `a`.
