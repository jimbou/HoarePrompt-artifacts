Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is a list containing t integers where each integer is the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in the string a, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is an empty string, prob is an empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where each element is the frequency of each character in the string a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same initial state, but the results list will be populated with t integers, each representing the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in the string a for each test case. The variables n, m, a, prob, and freq will retain their last values from the loop execution.
