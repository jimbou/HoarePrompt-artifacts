Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. The program first initializes a frequency array to keep track of the number of problems of each difficulty level. It then iterates over the string of problem difficulties and updates the frequency array accordingly. Finally, it calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create by summing up the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of upcoming rounds and the frequency of each difficulty level.

Correctness: **True**
