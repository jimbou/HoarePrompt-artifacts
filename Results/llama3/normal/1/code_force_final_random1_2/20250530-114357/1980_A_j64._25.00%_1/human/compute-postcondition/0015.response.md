Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list containing one integer missing which is the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 1 character, `prob` is the first character in the string `a`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**

In this output state, the value of `freq` has been updated to reflect the frequency of the first character `prob` in the string `a`. The element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in the `freq` list is now 1, indicating that the character `prob` has been encountered once. All other elements in the `freq` list remain 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
