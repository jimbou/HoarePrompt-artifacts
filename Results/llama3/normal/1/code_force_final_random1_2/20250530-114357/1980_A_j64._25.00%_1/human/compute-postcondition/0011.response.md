Output State: **t is at least 1, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is a list containing one integer missing which is the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in the string a, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', prob is the last character in the string a, freq is a list of 7 integers where the integer at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of prob minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by n times.**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that the variable `missing` is calculated as the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`. This value is then appended to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
