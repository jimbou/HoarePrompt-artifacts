Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to hold m rounds. The program iterates over each test case, calculates the frequency of each difficulty level, and then calculates the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each difficulty level. This sum represents the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

The program correctly handles the case where the frequency of a difficulty level is greater than m, in which case the difference is 0. It also correctly handles the case where the frequency of a difficulty level is less than m, in which case the difference is the difference between m and the frequency.

The program also correctly returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
