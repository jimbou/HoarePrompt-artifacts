Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list containing one integer missing which is the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 3 characters, `prob` is the third character in the string `a`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 2 and all other elements are 0, except for the element at index `ord(second_char) - ord('A')` which is 2 and the element at index `ord(first_char) - ord('A')` which is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the frequency of the third character in the string `a` has been incremented by 1 in the `freq` list.
