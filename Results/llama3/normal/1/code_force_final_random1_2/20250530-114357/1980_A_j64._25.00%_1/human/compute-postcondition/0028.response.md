Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list containing one integer which is the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 2 characters, `prob` is the second character in the string `a`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element is 0 except for the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the first character in the string `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A', which is 1, the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the second character in the string `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A', which is 2, and the other indices remain 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the frequency of the second character in the string `a` has been incremented by 1 in the `freq` list.
