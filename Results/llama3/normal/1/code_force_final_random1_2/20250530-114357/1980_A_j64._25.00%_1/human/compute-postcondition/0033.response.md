Output State: **t is at least 1, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is a list containing two integers where the first integer is the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in the string a, and the second integer is the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in the string a, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is an empty string, prob is an empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where each element is the frequency of each character in the string a.**

In natural language, after the code executes, the variable `missing` is calculated as the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`. This value is then appended to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. The string `a` and the variable `prob` are not affected by the code and remain empty. The list `freq` contains the frequency of each character in the string `a`, which is the same as the initial string because the code only calculates the frequency of each character.
