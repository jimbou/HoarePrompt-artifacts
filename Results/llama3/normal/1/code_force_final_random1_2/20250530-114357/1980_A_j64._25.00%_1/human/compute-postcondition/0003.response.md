To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `prob` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `a`. If `a` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', so we need to adjust `a` to have at least 1 character and `prob` is the first character in the string `a`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of at least 1 character from 'A' to 'G', `prob` is the first character in the string `a`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros**
