The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be at least 2.
State: **t is at least 2, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is a list containing one integer missing which is the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in the string a, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', prob is the last character in the string a, freq is a list of 7 integers where the integer at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of prob minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by n times.**
