Output State: `t` is at least 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list containing one integer which is the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is an empty string, `prob` is an empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element is the frequency of each character in the string `a`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the string `a` will be empty because all its characters will have been processed, `prob` will also be an empty string because there will be no more characters to process, and `freq` will contain the frequency of each character in the string `a`. The other variables will remain unchanged.
