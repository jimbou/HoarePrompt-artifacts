Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n` <= 50, 1 <= `m` <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list containing one integer which is the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 1 character, `prob` is the first character in the string `a`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element is 0 except for the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A', which is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the frequency list `freq` now has a value of 1 at the index corresponding to the first character `prob` of the string `a`. This is because the code increments the frequency count of the first character `prob` in the string `a` by 1.
