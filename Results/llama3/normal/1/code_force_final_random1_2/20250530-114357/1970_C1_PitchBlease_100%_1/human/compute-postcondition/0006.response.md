To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of the `queue` variable, as it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop will continue as long as the `queue` is not empty.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple of a node and its distance, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is `start` and `dist` is 0. The current node is not equal to the target node.**
