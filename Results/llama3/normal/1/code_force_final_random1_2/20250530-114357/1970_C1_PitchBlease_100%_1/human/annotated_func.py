#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on the distance between a start node and two leaf nodes in a graph. It takes as input a positive integer n, a list of edges, and a start node, and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' depending on whether the distances are odd or even.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.

                visited.add(neighbor)

    #State: The loop terminates when the queue is empty, and the output state is the distance of the target node from the start node if the target node is reachable, otherwise it is -1.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between a start node and a target node in a tree. It takes as input the start node, the target node, and the tree structure, and returns the distance between the start and target nodes if the target node is reachable, otherwise it returns -1.
