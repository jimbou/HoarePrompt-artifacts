Output State: **The loop terminates when the queue is empty, and the output state is the distance of the target node from the start node if the target node is reachable, otherwise it is -1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the shortest distance from the start node to the target node in the tree if the target node is reachable from the start node. If the target node is not reachable from the start node, the output state is -1. The loop terminates when all nodes reachable from the start node have been visited and the queue is empty.
