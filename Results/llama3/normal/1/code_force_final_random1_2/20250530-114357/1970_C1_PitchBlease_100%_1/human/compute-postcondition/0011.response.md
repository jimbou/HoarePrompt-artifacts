The code removes the leftmost element from the queue and assigns it to the variables `current` and `dist`. The queue must not be empty, so after this operation, the queue will have one less element.

Output State: **The program returns the distance of the target node from the start node if the current node is the target node. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning any value, `current` is assigned the value of the leftmost element of the queue, `dist` is assigned the value of the distance of the leftmost element of the queue, and the queue has one less element.**
