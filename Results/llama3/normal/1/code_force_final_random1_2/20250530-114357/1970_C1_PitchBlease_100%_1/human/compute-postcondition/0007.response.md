Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple of a node and its distance, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is the first node in the queue and `dist` is the distance of the first node in the queue. The current node is not equal to the target node.**

In this output state, the values of `start`, `target`, and `tree` remain unchanged. The `queue` has been updated by removing the first tuple of a node and its distance. The `visited` set still contains `start`. The `current` variable now holds the value of the first node in the queue, and the `dist` variable holds the distance of the first node in the queue. The current node is still not equal to the target node.
