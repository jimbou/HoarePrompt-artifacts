To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `while queue:`. This loop will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
- `queue` is a deque containing a tuple of `start` and 0.
- `visited` is a set containing `start`.

The only variable in the loop head is `queue`. For the loop to execute the first time, `queue` must not be empty. Since `queue` is already described as containing a tuple of `start` and 0, it is not empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `queue` or any other variables for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing a tuple of `start` and 0, `visited` is a set containing `start`.**
