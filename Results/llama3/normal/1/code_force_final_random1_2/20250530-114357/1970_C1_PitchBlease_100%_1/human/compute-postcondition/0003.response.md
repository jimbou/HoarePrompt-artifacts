Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances, `visited` is a set containing `start`, and the current value of `current` is equal to `target`, and the current value of `dist` is 0.**
