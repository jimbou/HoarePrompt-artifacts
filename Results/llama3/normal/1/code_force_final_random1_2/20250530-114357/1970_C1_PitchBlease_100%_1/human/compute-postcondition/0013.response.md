Postcondition: **The program either returns the distance of the target node from the start node if the current node is the target node, or continues execution without returning any value, assigning the leftmost element of the queue to `current`, the distance of the leftmost element to `dist`, and reducing the queue by one element if the current node is not the target node.**
