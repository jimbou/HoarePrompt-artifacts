According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable queue. If queue is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the program returns the distance of the target node from the start node if the current node is the target node. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning any value. This means that the current node is not the target node. So for the loop to be executed one more time the queue must not be empty.
State: **The program returns the distance of the target node from the start node if the current node is the target node. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning any value and the queue must not be empty.**
