Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances, `visited` is a set containing `start`, `current` is `start` and `dist` is 0.**

In this output state, the code has removed the first element from the `queue`, which was a tuple containing `start` and 0, and assigned these values to `current` and `dist`, respectively. The values of `start`, `target`, `tree`, and `visited` remain unchanged.
