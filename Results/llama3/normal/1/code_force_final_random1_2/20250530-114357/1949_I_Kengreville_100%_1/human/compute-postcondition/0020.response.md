Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where coef[i] is 1 if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains None, i is n-1, tot is a value that may or may not be 0, bipartite is True if the graph is bipartite and False otherwise, ok is True if the graph is bipartite and tot is not 0 and False otherwise, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has visited all nodes in the graph, and the visited list is now a list of all True values. The coef list has been updated to reflect the coefficients of the nodes that were not visited before. The value of i is now n-1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of tot may or may not be 0, depending on the graph. The bipartite variable is True if the graph is bipartite and False otherwise. The ok variable is True if the graph is bipartite and tot is not 0, and False otherwise. The stdin still contains 0 inputs.
