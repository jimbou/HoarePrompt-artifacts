You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: the first input is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and the next n inputs are three integers each, representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of a disk, such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9.
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `x` is a list of n values where all values are integers, `y` is a list of n values where all values are integers, `r` is a list of n values where all values are integers, `visited` is a list of n False values, `coef` is a list of n None values, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is n-1.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will be fully populated with integers, representing the x, y coordinates and radius of each disk, respectively. The `visited` list remains unchanged with all False values, and the `coef` list remains unchanged with all None values. The `stdin` will be empty as all inputs have been consumed, and the loop counter `i` will be at `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where coef[i] is 1 if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains None, i is n-1, tot is a value that may or may not be 0, bipartite is True if the graph is bipartite and False otherwise, ok is True if the graph is bipartite and tot is not 0 and False otherwise, stdin contains 0 inputs.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where coef[i] is 1 if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains None, i is n-1, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the graph is bipartite and the current value of tot is not 0, then ok is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, ok is False because either the graph is not bipartite or tot is 0, and 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where coef[i] is 1 if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains None, i is n-1, the current value of tot is not 0, the graph is bipartite, and ok is True, and 'YES' is being printed

Case_2: n is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where coef[i] is 1 if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains None, i is n-1, tot is a value that may or may not be 0, bipartite is True if the graph is bipartite and False otherwise, ok is False because either the graph is not bipartite or tot is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, and 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
