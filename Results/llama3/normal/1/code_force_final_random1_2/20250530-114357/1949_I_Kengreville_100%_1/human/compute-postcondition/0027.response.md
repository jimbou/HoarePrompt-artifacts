Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where coef[i] is 1 if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains None, i is n-1, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the graph is bipartite and the current value of tot is not 0, then ok is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, ok is False because either the graph is not bipartite or tot is 0, and 'NO' is printed.**
