Functionality: **This function determines whether a graph represented by a set of disks is bipartite and has a non-zero total value. It takes as input a series of disks, each described by its x and y coordinates and radius, and outputs 'YES' if the graph is bipartite and has a non-zero total value, and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes the input disks, checks for bipartiteness, and calculates the total value. If the graph is bipartite and the total value is non-zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
