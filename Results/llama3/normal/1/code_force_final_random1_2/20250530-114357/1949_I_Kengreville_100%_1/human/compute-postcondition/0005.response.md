The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `x` is a list of n values where `x[0]` is an integer and `x[1]` is an integer and the rest are None, `y` is a list of n values where `y[0]` is an integer and `y[1]` is an integer and the rest are None, `r` is a list of n values where `r[0]` is an integer and `r[1]` is an integer and the rest are None, `visited` is a list of n False values, `coef` is a list of n None values, `stdin` contains n-3 inputs: each input is three integers representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of a disk, `i` is 2**
