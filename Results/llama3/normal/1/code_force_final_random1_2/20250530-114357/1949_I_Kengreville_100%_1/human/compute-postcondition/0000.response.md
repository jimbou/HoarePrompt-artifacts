Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n None values, y is a list of n None values, r is a list of n None values, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains n inputs: each input is three integers representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of a disk.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which was read from the first input in stdin. The lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` are all initialized with `n` elements, each set to `None`. The `visited` list is initialized with `n` `False` values. Stdin now contains `n` inputs, each consisting of three integers representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of a disk.
