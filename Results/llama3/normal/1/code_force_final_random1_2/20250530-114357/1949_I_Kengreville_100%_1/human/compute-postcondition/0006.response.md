Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `x` is a list of n values where `x[0]` is an integer, `x[1]` is an integer, `x[2]` is an integer, and the rest are None, `y` is a list of n values where `y[0]` is an integer, `y[1]` is an integer, `y[2]` is an integer, and the rest are None, `r` is a list of n values where `r[0]` is an integer, `r[1]` is an integer, `r[2]` is an integer, and the rest are None, `visited` is a list of n False values, `coef` is a list of n None values, `stdin` contains n-4 inputs: each input is three integers representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of a disk, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, and `r` at index 2 have been updated to integers, and the number of inputs in `stdin` has decreased by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
