Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `x` is a list of n values where `x[0]` is an integer and `x[1]` is an integer and the rest are None, `y` is a list of n values where `y[0]` is an integer and `y[1]` is an integer and the rest are None, `r` is a list of n values where `r[0]` is an integer and `r[1]` is an integer and the rest are None, `visited` is a list of n False values, `coef` is a list of n None values, `stdin` contains n-3 inputs: each input is three integers representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of a disk, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]` are assigned the values of the next input from `stdin`, which is a list of three integers representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of a disk. The values of the other variables remain the same, except for `stdin` which now contains one less input.
