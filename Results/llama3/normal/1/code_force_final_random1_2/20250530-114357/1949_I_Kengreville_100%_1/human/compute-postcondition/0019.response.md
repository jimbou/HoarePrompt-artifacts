Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n values where the current value of visited[i] is True if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains False, coef is a list of n values where coef[i] is 1 if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains None, i is 2, if the node i was not visited before, then tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is True if the graph is bipartite and tot is not 0 and False otherwise. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
