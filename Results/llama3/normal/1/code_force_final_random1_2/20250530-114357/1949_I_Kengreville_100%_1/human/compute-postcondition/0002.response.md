Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `x` is a list of n values where `x[0]` is an integer and the rest are None, `y` is a list of n values where `y[0]` is an integer and the rest are None, `r` is a list of n values where `r[0]` is an integer and the rest are None, `visited` is a list of n False values, `coef` is a list of n None values, `stdin` contains n-1 inputs: each input is three integers representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of a disk, `i` is 0**.

In this output state, the values of `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` are integers representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of the first disk, respectively. The rest of the values in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` are still None. The values of `visited` and `coef` are still lists of n False values and n None values, respectively. The stdin now contains n-1 inputs, each representing the x, y coordinates and the radius r of the remaining disks. The value of `i` is still 0.
