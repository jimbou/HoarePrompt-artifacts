The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n values where the current value of visited[i] is True if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains False, coef is a list of n values where coef[i] is 1 if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains None, i is 2, if the node i was not visited before, then tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is True if the graph is bipartite and tot is not 0 and False otherwise. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. stdin contains 0 inputs.**
