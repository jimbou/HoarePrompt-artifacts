Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n values where the current value of visited[i] is True if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains False, coef is a list of n values where coef[i] is 1 if i was not visited before, otherwise it remains None, i is 2, tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is True if the graph is bipartite and tot is not 0 and False otherwise.**

The code snippet modifies the values of coef, tot, bipartite, and ok. The first line assigns 1 to coef[i], indicating that node i has been visited. The second line resets tot to 0. The third line sets bipartite to True, assuming the graph is bipartite initially. The fourth line calls the dfs function with node i, which may modify the values of visited, coef, tot, and bipartite. The fifth line updates ok based on the values of bipartite and tot. If the graph is bipartite and tot is not 0, ok becomes True; otherwise, it remains False. The values of n, x, y, r, and i remain unchanged.
