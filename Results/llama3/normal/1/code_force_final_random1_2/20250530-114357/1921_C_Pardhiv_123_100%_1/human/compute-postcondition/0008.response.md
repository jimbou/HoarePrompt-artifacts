Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `f` is an integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[3] - ls[2]), b)`, `a` and `b` are integers, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
