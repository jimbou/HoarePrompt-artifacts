To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. 

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is 1**
