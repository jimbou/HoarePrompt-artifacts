Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three remaining space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
    ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
    if f > 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least `n`, `f` is an integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n - 1]), b)`, `a` and `b` are integers, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`. If the current value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` is equal to the value of the first input, `a` is equal to the value of the third input, `b` is equal to the value of the fourth input, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`. If the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements of `ls` and `b` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than or equal to 1, n is equal to 0, a is equal to the value of a, b is equal to the value of b, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, i is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. If f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. If f is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
