Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is equal to the value of the first input, f is equal to the value of the second input, a is equal to the value of the third input, b is equal to the value of the fourth input, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the values provided in the input. The list `ls` now contains `n+1` elements, including the initial 0 and the `n` integers provided in the second line of input. The value of `i` remains equal to `n`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, with each test case having two lines of input. The original value of `t` is not affected by the code and remains greater than 0.
