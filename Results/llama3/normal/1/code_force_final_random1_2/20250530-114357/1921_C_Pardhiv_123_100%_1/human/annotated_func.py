#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is equal to 0, n is equal to the value of the first input, a is equal to the value of the third input, b is equal to the value of the fourth input, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, i is equal to n, stdin contains no test cases. If the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements of ls and b is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed for each test case. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four integers (n, f, a, b) and a list of n integers. It calculates the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements of the list and b, subtracts the sum of these values from f, and prints 'YES' if the result is greater than 0, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been consumed.
