Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is an integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[2] - ls[1]), b)`, `a` and `b` are integers, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, with each test case having two lines of input. The list `ls` still has `n+1` elements, and `i` is still 2.
