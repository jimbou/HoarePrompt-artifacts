Output State: **t is equal to 0, n is equal to the value of the first input, a is equal to the value of the third input, b is equal to the value of the fourth input, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, i is equal to n, stdin contains no test cases. If the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements of ls and b is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed for each test case. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables n, a, and b will retain their values from the last test case. The list ls will contain the integers from the last test case, and the variable i will be equal to n. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all test cases have been processed. The output will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' messages, one for each test case, depending on whether the value of f (the second input) minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements of ls and b is greater than 0 or not.
