The code `t = int(input(''))` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, the first line of the first test case is read, which contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. However, the code only reads an integer, so it will only read the first integer `n` from the first test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three remaining space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.**
