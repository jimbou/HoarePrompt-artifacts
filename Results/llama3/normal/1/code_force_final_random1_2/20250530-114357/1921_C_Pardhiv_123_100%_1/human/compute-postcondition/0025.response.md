Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is equal to the value of the second input minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the fourth and third elements of `ls` and `b`, `a` is equal to the value of the third input, `b` is equal to the value of the fourth input, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the fourth and third elements of `ls` and `b` from its original value. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `i` remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` remains the same, with multiple test cases minus one, each containing two lines of input.
