The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than or equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least `n`, `f` is an integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n - 1]), b)`, `a` and `b` are integers, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`. If the current value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
