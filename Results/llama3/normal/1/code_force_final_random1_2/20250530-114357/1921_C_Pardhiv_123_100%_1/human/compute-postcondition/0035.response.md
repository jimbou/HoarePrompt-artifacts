Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` is equal to the value of the first input, `a` is equal to the value of the third input, `b` is equal to the value of the fourth input, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`. If the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements of `ls` and `b` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` has decreased by 1, but it is still greater than 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `i` remain the same. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are still the same, based on the values of the second input, `a`, `b`, and the elements of `ls`.
