Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, n is at least n, f is an integer and is equal to f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n - 1]), b), a and b are integers, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
