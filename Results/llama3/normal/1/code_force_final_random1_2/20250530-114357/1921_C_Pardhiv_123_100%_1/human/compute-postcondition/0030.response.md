Output: **t is greater than 0, n is equal to the value of the first input, f is equal to the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements of ls and b, a is equal to the value of the third input, b is equal to the value of the fourth input, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. The current value of f is greater than 0, and 'YES' is printed**
