Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `f` is an integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`, `a` and `b` are integers, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated based on the given formula, which involves the minimum of two expressions: `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` is still present, but one test case has been processed.
