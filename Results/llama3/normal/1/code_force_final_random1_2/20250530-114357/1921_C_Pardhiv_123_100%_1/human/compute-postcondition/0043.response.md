Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is greater than 0 and is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b`, `a` is equal to the value of `a`, `b` is equal to the value of `b`, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, with each test case having two lines of input.
