Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is greater than 0 and is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b`, `a` is equal to the value of `a`, `b` is equal to the value of `b`, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are the values from the input, and `ls` is the list of integers from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `i` remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, with each test case having two lines of input.
