Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is equal to the value of the second input minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`, `a` is equal to the value of the third input, `b` is equal to the value of the fourth input, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b` from its original value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, with each test case having two lines of input.
