Output State: **t is greater than 0, n, f, a, and b are integers, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.**

The code reads two lines of input from stdin for one test case. The first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, which are assigned to the variables n, f, a, and b, respectively. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, which are assigned to the list ls, with a 0 prepended to the list. The variable t is not affected by the code and remains greater than 0. The stdin now contains one less test case.
