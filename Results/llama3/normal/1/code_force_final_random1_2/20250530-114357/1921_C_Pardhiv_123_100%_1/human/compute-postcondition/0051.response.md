Postcondition: **t is greater than 1, n is equal to 0, a is equal to the value of a, b is equal to the value of b, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, i is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. If f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. If f is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.**
