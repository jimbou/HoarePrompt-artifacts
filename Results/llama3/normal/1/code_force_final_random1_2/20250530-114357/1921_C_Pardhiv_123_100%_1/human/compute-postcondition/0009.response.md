Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is at least n, f is an integer and is equal to f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n - 1]), b), a and b are integers, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `t` remains greater than 0, the value of `n` remains at least `n`, the value of `f` is updated to be the result of subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the last two elements of `ls` and `b` from the initial value of `f`, the values of `a` and `b` remain integers, the list `ls` remains a list of integers with `n+1` elements, the input from `stdin` remains the same, and the value of `i` is equal to `n`.
