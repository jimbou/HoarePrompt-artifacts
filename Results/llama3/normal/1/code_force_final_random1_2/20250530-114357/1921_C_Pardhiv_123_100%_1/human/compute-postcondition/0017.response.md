Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least `n`, `f` is an integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n - 1]), b)`, `a` and `b` are integers, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`. If the current value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to 0. The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `i` remain unchanged. The input in stdin is still the same, with multiple test cases minus one. The printing of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `f` is still dependent on the current value of `f`.
