Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `f` is greater than 0 and is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`, `a` is equal to the value of `a`, `b` is equal to the value of `b`, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial properties, but the value of `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, with each test case having two lines of input.
