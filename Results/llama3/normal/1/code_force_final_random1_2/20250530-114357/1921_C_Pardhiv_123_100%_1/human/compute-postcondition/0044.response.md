Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is equal to 0, f is greater than or equal to 0 and is decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b for all i in range from 1 to n, a is equal to the value of a, b is equal to the value of b, ls is a list of integers with n+1 elements, i is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains greater than 1, `n` becomes 0, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, and the values of `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` becomes equal to `n`.
