To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

The current state is:

* `t` is greater than 1
* `n` is greater than 1
* `f` is greater than 0 and is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b`
* `a` is equal to the value of `a`
* `b` is equal to the value of `b`
* `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements
* `i` is 2
* stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1, since the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the new state is:

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is greater than 0 and is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b`, `a` is equal to the value of `a`, `b` is equal to the value of `b`, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.**
