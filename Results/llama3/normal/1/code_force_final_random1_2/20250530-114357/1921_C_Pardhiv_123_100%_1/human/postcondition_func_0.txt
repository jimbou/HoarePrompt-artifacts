This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four integers (n, f, a, b) and a list of n integers. It calculates the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements of the list and b, subtracts the sum of these values from f, and prints 'YES' if the result is greater than 0, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been consumed.
