The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `f` is an integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`, `a` and `b` are integers, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is 2**
