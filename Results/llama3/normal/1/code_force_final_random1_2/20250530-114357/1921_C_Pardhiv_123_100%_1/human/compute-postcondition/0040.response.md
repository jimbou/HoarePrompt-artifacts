The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is greater than 0 and is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`, `a` is equal to the value of `a`, `b` is equal to the value of `b`, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.**
