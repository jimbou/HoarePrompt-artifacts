Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. It iterates through the list of message sending moments, calculates the minimum charge consumption between each moment (either by keeping the phone on or turning it off and on), and subtracts this consumption from the initial phone charge. If the remaining charge is greater than 0 after all messages have been sent, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where the phone's charge is sufficient to send all messages without turning it off and on, and the case where the phone's charge is not sufficient to send all messages without turning it off and on.
