The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `f` is an integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[2] - ls[1]), b)`, `a` and `b` are integers, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is 3**
