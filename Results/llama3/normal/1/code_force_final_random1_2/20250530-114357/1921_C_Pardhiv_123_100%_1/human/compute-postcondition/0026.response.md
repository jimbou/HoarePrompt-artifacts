Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `f` is equal to the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of `a` times the difference between each pair of adjacent elements in `ls` and `b`, `a` is equal to the value of the third input, `b` is equal to the value of the fourth input, `ls` is a list of integers with `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers: `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `f` will be the initial value of `f` minus the sum of the minimum of `a` times the difference between each pair of adjacent elements in `ls` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
