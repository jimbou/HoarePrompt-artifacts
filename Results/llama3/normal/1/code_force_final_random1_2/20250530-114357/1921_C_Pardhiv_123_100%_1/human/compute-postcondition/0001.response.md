To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `t > 0`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer,
- stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `t`. Since `t` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we adjust its state from being "an integer" to being "greater than 0".

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains three space-separated integers: f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.**
