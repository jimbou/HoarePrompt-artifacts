Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 3. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `j` is 1 and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
