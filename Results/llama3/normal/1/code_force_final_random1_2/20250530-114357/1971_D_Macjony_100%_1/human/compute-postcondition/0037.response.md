Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 2 and `j` is 0. If the current value of `s[j]` is '0' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
