Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If there exists at least one pair of adjacent characters in s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', then count is between 0 and len(s)-1 and j is len(s) - 1. Otherwise, count is between 1 and len(s) and j is len(s) - 1.***
