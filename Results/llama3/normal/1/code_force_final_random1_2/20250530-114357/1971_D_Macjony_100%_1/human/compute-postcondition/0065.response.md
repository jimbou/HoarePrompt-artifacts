Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1, count is 2, j is 0. If the current value of s[j] is '0' and the current value of s[j + 1] is '1', then flag is True. Otherwise, flag is False.***
