The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer accepted from the input. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). So `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the stdin and the stdin now contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The value of `t` is between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).**
