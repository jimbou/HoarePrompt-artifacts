Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, `count` is 2, 3 or 4, `j` is 2 and `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`. If `s[j-1]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', then `count` is 3 and `flag` is True. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
