Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), count is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in s plus the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in s plus 1, j is equal to the length of s minus 1, and if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in s, then flag is True and count is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in s plus the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in s. Otherwise, flag is False, and the count (which is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in s plus the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in s plus 1) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If s contains the substring '01', then count is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different minus 1, otherwise count is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different. j is equal to the length of s minus 1, and the count is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If there exists at least one pair of adjacent characters in s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', then count is between 0 and len(s)-1 and j is len(s) - 1. Otherwise, count is between 1 and len(s) and j is len(s) - 1, and count is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
