Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, count is 2 or 3, j is 1 and j is less than len(s) - 1. If s[j] is '0' and s[j + 1] is '1', then count is 3 and flag is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
