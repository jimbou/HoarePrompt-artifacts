To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `t` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If s contains the substring '01', then count is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different minus 1, otherwise count is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different. j is equal to the length of s minus 1, and the count is printed**
