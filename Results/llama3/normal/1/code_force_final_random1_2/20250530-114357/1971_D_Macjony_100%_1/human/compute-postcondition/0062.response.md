Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1, `count` is 2, `flag` is False, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[j + 1]`. Additionally, the current value of `s[j]` is '0' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'.***
