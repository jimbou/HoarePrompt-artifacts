Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, `j` is 2, `count` is 4 if `s[1]` is not equal to `s[2]`, otherwise `count` is 1. If `s[2]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
