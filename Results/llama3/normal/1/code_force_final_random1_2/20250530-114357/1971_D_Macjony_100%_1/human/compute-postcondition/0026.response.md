Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), count is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in s plus the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in s plus 1, j is equal to the length of s minus 1, and if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in s, then flag is True and count is the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in s plus the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in s. Otherwise, flag is False.***
