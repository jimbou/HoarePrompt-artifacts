Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If s contains the substring '01', then count is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different minus 1, otherwise count is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different. j is equal to the length of s minus 1.***
