Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, `j` is 2, `count` is increased by 1. If `s` contains the substring '01' starting at index `j`, then `flag` is True. Otherwise, no change in `flag` occurs.***
