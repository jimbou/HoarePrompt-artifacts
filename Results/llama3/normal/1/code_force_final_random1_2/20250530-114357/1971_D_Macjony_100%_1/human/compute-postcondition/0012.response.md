Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 3. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3 if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
