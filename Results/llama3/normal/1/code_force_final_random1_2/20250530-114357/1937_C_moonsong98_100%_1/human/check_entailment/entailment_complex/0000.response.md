Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where it needs to find two indices i and j in a secret sequence p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. 

func_1 is used to ask queries in the format "? a b c d" and returns the response from the user. func_2 is used to print the result in the format "! a b". func_3 is the main function that implements the logic to find the indices i and j.

In func_3, it first checks if n is 2. If n is 2, it directly calls func_2 with arguments 0 and 1. If n is greater than 2, it iteratively finds the maximum index i for which func_1 returns '<'. Then, it finds the minimum index i for which func_1 returns '=' or '<' with respect to the maximum index. Finally, it calls func_2 with the maximum and minimum indices as arguments.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. It uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
