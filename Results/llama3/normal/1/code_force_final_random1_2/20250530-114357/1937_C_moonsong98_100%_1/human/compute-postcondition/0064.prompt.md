Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, and `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`.
Code of the loop:
for i in min_indices:
    if i == max_index:
        continue
    res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)
    if res == '=':
        min_index = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`, `min_indices` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `min_indices`, and the current value of `res` is either '=' or not '='. If `res` is '=', then `min_index` is the first element in the list `min_indices`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_indices` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the second element in the list `min_indices`, `min_index` is the second element in the list `min_indices`, and `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. If `res` is '=', then `min_index` is the second element in the list `min_indices` and `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_indices` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `min_indices`, `min_index` is the third element in the list `min_indices`, and `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, and if `i` is equal to `max_index`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `res` is '=', then `min_index` is updated to `i` and `res` is updated to the result of `func_1(i, i, i, i)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
