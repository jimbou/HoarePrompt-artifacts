Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, and the current value of `n` is 2, and the function `func_2` has been called with arguments 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as 2, and the function `func_2` has been executed with arguments 0 and 1. Since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the program's state. However, we can conclude that the function has been called with the specified arguments.
