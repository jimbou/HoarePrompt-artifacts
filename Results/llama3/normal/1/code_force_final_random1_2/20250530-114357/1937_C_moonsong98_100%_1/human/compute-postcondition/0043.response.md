Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, and `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`.**

In this output state, the value of `min_index` has been updated to be the smallest index in the list `min_indices`, which can be either `n-1`, `max_index`, or the smallest of `max_index` and `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
