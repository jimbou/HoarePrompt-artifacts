Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_indices` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the second element in the list `min_indices`, and the current value of `res` is either '=' or not '='. If `res` is '=', then `min_index` is the second element in the list `min_indices`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
