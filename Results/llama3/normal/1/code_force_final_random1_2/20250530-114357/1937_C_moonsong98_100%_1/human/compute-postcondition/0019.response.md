Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, and `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the last index `n-1`, and the result `res` is the return value of the function `func_1` called with the current `max_index` and `i`. The `max_index` variable has been updated to the largest index `i` for which the function `func_1` returns '<'. The initial state conditions on `n` remain unchanged.
