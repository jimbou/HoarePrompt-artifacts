Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing 2.**

In this output state, the value of `min_indices` has been updated to a list containing 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state.
