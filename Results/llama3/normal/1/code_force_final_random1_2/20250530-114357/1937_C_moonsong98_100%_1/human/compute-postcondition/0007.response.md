Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 0, `res` is the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 0, 0)`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `max_index`, and `i` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. The variable `res` is assigned the return value of the function `func_1` when called with arguments 0, 0, 0, and 0. The stdin remains empty as there is no input operation in the given code.
