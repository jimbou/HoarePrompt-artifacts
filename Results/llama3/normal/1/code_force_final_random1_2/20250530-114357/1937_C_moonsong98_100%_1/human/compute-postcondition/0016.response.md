Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the return value of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, and `max_index` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous value of `res`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the return value of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, where `max_index` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous value of `res`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `max_index` is also updated based on the previous value of `res`.
