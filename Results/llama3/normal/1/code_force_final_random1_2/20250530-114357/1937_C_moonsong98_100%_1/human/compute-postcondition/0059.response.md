Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_indices` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `min_indices`, `min_index` is the third element in the list `min_indices`, and `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `n`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, `i`, `min_index`, and `res` remain unchanged.
