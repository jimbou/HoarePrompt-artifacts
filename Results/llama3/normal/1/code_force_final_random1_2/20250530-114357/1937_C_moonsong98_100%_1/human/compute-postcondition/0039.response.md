Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'. If `res` equals '<', then `min_indices` is a list containing 1 and 2. If `res` equals '=', then `min_indices` is a list containing either 0 and 2, or `max_index` and 0 and 2, or `max_index` and 2.**

In this output state, the value of `min_indices` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `min_indices` has been updated to reflect the new value of `i`.
