Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`, `min_indices` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `min_indices`, `min_index` is the first element in the list `min_indices`, and the current value of `res` is '='**

In this output state, the value of `min_index` has been updated to be the first element in the list `min_indices`, which is also the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
