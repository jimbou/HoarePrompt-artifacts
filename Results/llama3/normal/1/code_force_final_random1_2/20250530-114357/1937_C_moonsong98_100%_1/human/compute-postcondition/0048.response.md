Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, and `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`, `min_indices` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `min_indices`. If `i` is equal to `max_index`, then the function skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration, otherwise the function continues with the rest of the loop iteration. `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `res` which is assigned the result of the function `func_1` called with the arguments `min_index`, `min_index`, `min_index`, and `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
