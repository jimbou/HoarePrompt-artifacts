According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `min_indices`. If `min_indices` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, and `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`. So for the loop to be executed  the list `min_indices` must have at least 1 element and the variable `i` is the first element in the list `min_indices`.
State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is the first element in the list `min_indices`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, and `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`, `min_indices` must have at least 1 element**
