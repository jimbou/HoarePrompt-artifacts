Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is 0, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', and `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be the return value of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `max_index`, `max_index`, `max_index`, and `0`, and its return value is assigned to `res`. The other variables, including `n`, `i`, `max_index`, and `min_indices`, retain their original values.
