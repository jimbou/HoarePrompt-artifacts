Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`, `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, min_index)`, and `i` is the last element in the list `min_indices`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the `min_indices` list, updating `min_index` and `res` accordingly. The loop has skipped over any iterations where `i` is equal to `max_index`. The final state of `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`, and `res` is the result of the last call to `func_1` with `min_index` as all arguments. The loop has finished executing, and the values of `n`, `max_index`, and `min_indices` remain unchanged.
