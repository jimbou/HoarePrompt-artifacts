This function takes a positive integer n as input, where n is greater than or equal to 2. It then performs a series of operations using two external functions, func_1 and func_2. If n is 2, the function calls func_2 with arguments 0 and 1 and returns without any output. If n is greater than 2, the function iteratively finds the maximum index i for which func_1 returns '<', and then finds the minimum index i for which func_1 returns '=' or '<' with respect to the maximum index. Finally, it calls func_2 with the maximum and minimum indices as arguments, but does not return any value.
