Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state. The code only introduces a new variable `max_index` and assigns it the value 0. The stdin remains empty as there was no input in the initial state.
