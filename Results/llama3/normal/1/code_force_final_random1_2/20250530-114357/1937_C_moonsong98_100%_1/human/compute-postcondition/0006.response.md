To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, we can focus on adjusting `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains no input**
