Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_indices` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `min_indices`, `min_index` is equal to `i`, and `res` is the result of `func_1(i, i, i, i)`, and if `i` is equal to `max_index`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `min_index` has been updated to be equal to `i`, which is the third element in the list `min_indices`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, and `res` are still valid.
