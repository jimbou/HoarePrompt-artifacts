Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer larger than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'. If `res` equals '<', then `min_indices` is a list containing 1 and 2. If `res` equals '=', then `min_indices` is a list containing either 0 and 2, or `max_index` and 0 and 2, or `max_index` and 2. If `res` does not equal '=' or '<', then `min_indices` is a list containing 1.***
