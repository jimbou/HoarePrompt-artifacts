Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, and `min_index` is the smallest index in `min_indices`, `min_indices` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `min_indices` and is equal to `max_index`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
