Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', and `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `res`, and `max_index` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `min_indices`, which is a list containing the value of `max_index`.
