Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1, and `res` is the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 0, 1)`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `max_index`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is updated to be the return value of the function `func_1` called with arguments 0, 0, 0, and 1.
