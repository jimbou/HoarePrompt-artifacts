Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_indices` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the second element in the list `min_indices`, and `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the result of the function call `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. The other variables remain unchanged, as their values were not affected by the code. The loop continues with the current values of `n`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, `i`, and the updated value of `res`.
