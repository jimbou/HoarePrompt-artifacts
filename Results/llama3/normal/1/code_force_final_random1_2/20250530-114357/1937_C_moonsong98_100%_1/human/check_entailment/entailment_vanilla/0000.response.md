Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that `p_i XOR p_j` is maximized. The program uses a combination of three functions to achieve this goal.

Function 1, `func_1`, is used to ask queries to the interactor. It takes four indices `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as input and prints a query in the format `? a b c d`. It then reads the response from the interactor and returns it.

Function 2, `func_2`, is used to print the final answer in the format `! a b`.

Function 3, `func_3`, is the main function that solves the problem. It first reads the value of `n` from the input and handles the special case where `n` is 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it finds the index `max_index` that corresponds to the maximum value in the sequence `p`. It then finds the indices `min_indices` that correspond to the minimum values in the sequence `p` by comparing each index with `max_index`. Finally, it finds the index `min_index` that corresponds to the minimum value in the sequence `p` by comparing each index in `min_indices` with itself.

The program then prints the final answer using `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index` as the two indices that maximize `p_i XOR p_j`.

The program uses at most `3n` queries to find the solution, which is within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
