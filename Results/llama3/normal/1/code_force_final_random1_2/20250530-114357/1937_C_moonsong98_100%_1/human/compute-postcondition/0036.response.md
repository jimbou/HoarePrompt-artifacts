The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0 and `n` is not equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'. If `res` equals '<', then `min_indices` is a list containing 1. If `res` equals '=', then `i` is added to `min_indices` and `min_indices` is a list containing either 0, or `max_index` and 0, or `max_index`.**
