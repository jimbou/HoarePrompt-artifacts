Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', and `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows:

*   `n` remains an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, as it was in the initial state.
*   `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
*   `res` holds the return value of the last call to `func_1`, which was made with `max_index`, `min_indices[0]`, `max_index`, and `n-1` as arguments.
*   `max_index` remains the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', as it was in the initial state.
*   `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, depending on the return value of `func_1` during the last iteration of the loop.
