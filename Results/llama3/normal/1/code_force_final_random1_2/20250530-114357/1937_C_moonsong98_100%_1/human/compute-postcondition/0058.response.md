To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in min_indices:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements in the `min_indices` list. The current state is:

* `n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2
* `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'
* `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_indices` must have at least 1 element
* `i` is the second element in the list `min_indices`
* `min_index` is the second element in the list `min_indices`
* `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The loop will move to the next element in the `min_indices` list.
* The `i` variable will take the value of the next element in the list.
* The `min_index` variable will also take the value of the next element in the list, since it is defined as the second element in the list.

Since `min_indices` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is currently the second element, we can conclude that `min_indices` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `min_indices` must have at least 3 elements.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1`, or `max_index` and `n-1`, or `max_index`, `min_indices` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `min_indices`, `min_index` is the third element in the list `min_indices`, and `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`**

Note that we didn't change the state of `res` because it is not directly related to the loop head. Its value will be updated in the next iteration based on the new values of `min_index` and `i`.
