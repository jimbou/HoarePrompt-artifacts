Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is 0, `res` is the return value of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', and `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`. If `res` is '=', `min_indices` also contains 0. `res` is not '<'.***
