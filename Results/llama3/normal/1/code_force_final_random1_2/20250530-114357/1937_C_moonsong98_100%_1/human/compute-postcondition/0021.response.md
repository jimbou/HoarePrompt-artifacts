To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `n-1` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range of the loop, which is from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to be 0, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is 0, `res` is the return value of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', and `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`.**
