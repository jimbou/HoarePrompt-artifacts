The value of `count[num]` is decremented by 1. Since `num` is the first element in the list `a` and it exists in the dictionary `count`, the value of `count[num]` is now one less than its previous value. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31 that must have at least 1 element, `res` is 0, `count` is a dictionary where the value of `num` is one less than its previous value, `num` is the first element in the list and it exists in the dictionary `count`**
