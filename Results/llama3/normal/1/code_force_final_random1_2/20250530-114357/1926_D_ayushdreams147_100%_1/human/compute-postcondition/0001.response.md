According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31, res is 0, count is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the num is the first element in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31 that must have at least 1 element, res is 0, count is an empty dictionary, num is the first element in the list**
