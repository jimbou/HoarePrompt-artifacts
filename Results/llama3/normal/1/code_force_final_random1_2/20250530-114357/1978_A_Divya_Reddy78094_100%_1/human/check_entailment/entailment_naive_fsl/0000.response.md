Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the maximum number of pages is not in the last book. For example, if the input is:

3
3 1 2

The program will output 5 (3 + 2), but the correct output should be 4 (3 + 1). The program assumes that the maximum number of pages is always in the last book, which is not necessarily true.

The correct approach would be to sort the books in descending order of their page numbers and then select the maximum number of pages from the first two books. Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
