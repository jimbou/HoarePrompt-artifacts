The `print` statement will output the sum of the maximum value among the first `n-1` elements of the `nums` list and the last element of the `nums` list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `nums[:-1]` slices the `nums` list to exclude the last element. This creates a new list containing the first `n-1` elements of `nums`.
2. `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value among these `n-1` elements.
3. `nums[-1]` accesses the last element of the `nums` list.
4. The `+` operator adds the maximum value from step 2 to the last element from step 3.

Since the exact values of the elements in the `nums` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the maximum value among the first `n-1` elements and the last element of the `nums` list.

Output: **max value among first n-1 elements of nums + last element of nums**
