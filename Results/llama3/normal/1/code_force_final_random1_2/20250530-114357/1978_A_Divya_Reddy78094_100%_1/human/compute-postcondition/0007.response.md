The `print` statement will print the sum of the maximum value of all elements in the list `nums` except the last one (`max(nums[:-1])`) and the last element of the list `nums` (`nums[-1]`).

Since `nums` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and each integer `a_i` in `nums` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), the maximum value of all elements in `nums` except the last one will be the largest integer in the list excluding the last element.

The last element of the list `nums` is simply the last integer in the list.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the maximum value of all elements in the list `nums` except the last one and the last element of the list `nums`.

Output: **max value of all elements in nums except the last one + last element of nums**
