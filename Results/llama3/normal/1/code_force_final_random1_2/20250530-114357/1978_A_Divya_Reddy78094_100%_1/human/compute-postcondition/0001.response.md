The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it does not need to be adjusted. `_` is a throwaway variable, so it does not need to be adjusted either.
State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
