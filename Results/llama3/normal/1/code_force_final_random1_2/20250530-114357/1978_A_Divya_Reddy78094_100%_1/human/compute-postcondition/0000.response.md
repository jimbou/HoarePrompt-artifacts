The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer accepted from the input. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The integer `t` is accepted from the input and assigned to `t`. The stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
