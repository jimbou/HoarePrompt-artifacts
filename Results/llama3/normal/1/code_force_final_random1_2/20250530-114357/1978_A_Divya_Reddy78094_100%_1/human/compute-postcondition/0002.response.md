Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 500), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer (2 <= n <= 100), nums is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**

The first line of the code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `t` test cases are provided in the initial state, this line consumes one test case, leaving `t-1` test cases in stdin. The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 100.

The second line reads `n` integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to the variable `nums`. Since `n` is between 2 and 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9. This line consumes `n` integers from stdin, leaving `t-1` test cases with their respective integers.

The final state includes the updated values of `n` and `nums`, as well as the remaining `t-1` test cases in stdin. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
