To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so we don't need to worry about its state.

The given state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500)
* `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases
* `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 100)
* `nums` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)
* The sum of the maximum of all elements in the list except the last one and the last element in the list is being printed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop executes again. Since the loop head only involves the variable `t`, we can only adjust the state of `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500). For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `t` to be `t-1`.

The other variables (`stdin`, `n`, `nums`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 499), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 100), `nums` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
