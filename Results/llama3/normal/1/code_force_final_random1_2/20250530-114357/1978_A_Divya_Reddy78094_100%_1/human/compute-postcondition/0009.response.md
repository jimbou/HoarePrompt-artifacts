To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` (which is a throwaway variable) is in the range of `t`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 499, and the loop has already executed `t-2` times, we need to adjust the value of `t` to ensure that the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 499, and `t-2` test cases have been processed. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than the number of test cases already processed, which is `t-2`. Therefore, we need to decrement `t` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 498), `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 100), `nums` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and this is printed: the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list `nums` except the last one and the last element in the list `nums`**
