Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 500), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 500), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer (2 <= n <= 100), nums is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list except the last one and the last element in the list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 499), n is an integer (2 <= n <= 100), nums is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), stdin contains t-2 test cases, and this is printed: the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list nums except the last one and the last element in the list nums

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer (2 <= n <= 100), nums is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), stdin contains t-4 test cases, and this is printed: the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list nums except the last element and the last element of the list nums




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
