The code reads the number of elements `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from the input, splits them into individual integers using the `split()` method, converts each integer to an integer using the `map()` function, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`.

Since `t` is an integer between 2 and 498, and `t-3` test cases are left in the input, the code will read `t-3` test cases from the input. For each test case, it will read the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `nums`.

After executing the code, the variable `n` will hold the value of the number of elements in the last test case, and the variable `nums` will hold the list of integers in the last test case.

The output state will include the updated values of `n` and `nums`, as well as the remaining `t-3-1 = t-4` test cases in the input.

Output State: **n is an integer (2 <= n <= 100), nums is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), stdin contains t-4 test cases**
