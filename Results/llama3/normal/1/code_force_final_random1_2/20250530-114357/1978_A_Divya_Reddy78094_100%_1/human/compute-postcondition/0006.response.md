Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 499), n is an integer (2 <= n <= 100), nums is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), stdin contains t-2 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), as it is assigned the value of the input integer. The list `nums` is updated to contain `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), as it is assigned the list of integers from the input. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, as two inputs are read from `stdin` (one for `n` and one for `nums`).
