Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 500), stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer (2 <= n <= 100), nums is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list except the last one and the last element in the list is being printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be an integer between 1 and 500, but there will be no more test cases left in the standard input (`stdin`). The variables `n` and `nums` will still be defined, with `n` being an integer between 2 and 100, and `nums` being a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9. The loop will have printed the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list except the last one and the last element in the list for each test case.
