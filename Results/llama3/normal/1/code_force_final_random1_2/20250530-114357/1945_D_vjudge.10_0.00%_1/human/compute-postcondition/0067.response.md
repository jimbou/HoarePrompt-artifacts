To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for y in b:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin that must have at least 1 element, and `y` is the first element in `b`.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must have at least one more element, and `y` should be the next element in `b`. Since `y` is currently the first element in `b`, the next element in `b` would be the second element.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin that must have at least 2 elements.
* `y` is the second element in `b`.

The other variables in the state, such as `x`, `i`, `a`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, and `custos`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus the first element in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in `b`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus all elements in `a`.**
