Output State: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the elements of `a_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `y` is now `max_p`, and `custos` has been increased by the elements of `a_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
