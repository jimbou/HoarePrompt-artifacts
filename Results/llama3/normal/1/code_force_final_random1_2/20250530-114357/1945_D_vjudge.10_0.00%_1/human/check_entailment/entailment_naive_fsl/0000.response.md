Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the maximum allowable final position of Kirill is 1. In this case, the program should only consider the cost of bribing the person at position 1, but the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, if the input is:

4 1
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5

The program should output 7, which is the cost of bribing the person at position 1. However, the program outputs 14, which is incorrect.

The issue is in the line `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):`, which does not consider the case when `max_p` is 1. To fix this, the program should add a special case to handle when `max_p` is 1.
