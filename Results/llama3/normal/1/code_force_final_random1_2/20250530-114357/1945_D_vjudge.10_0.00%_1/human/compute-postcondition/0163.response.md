Postcondition: ***x is greater than 2, i is 2, a is a list of integers, num_fila is an integer, max_p is an integer greater than 1, a_values is a list containing all elements of a as integers, b_values is a list containing all elements of b as integers, b is a list of integers, nf is a list of strings, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y], then if y is 1, custo is increased by the value of a_values at index 0 plus the value of b_values at index 2. Otherwise, custo is increased by the value of b_values at index 2. Otherwise, custo is increased by the value of a_values[y].***
