The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again x must be greater than 2.
State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custos` is a list of integers.**
