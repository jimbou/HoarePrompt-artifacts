Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is `a_values[y]`, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. The current value of `a_values[y]` is less than the current value of `b_values[y]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `a` is still a list of integers, `num_fila` is still an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is still an integer, `a_values` is still a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is still a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is still a list of integers, `y` is still `num_fila - 1`, `custos` is still a list of integers, `custo` has been updated to be the value of `a_values[y]`, `nf` is still a list of strings, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. The current value of `a_values[y]` is still less than the current value of `b_values[y]`.
