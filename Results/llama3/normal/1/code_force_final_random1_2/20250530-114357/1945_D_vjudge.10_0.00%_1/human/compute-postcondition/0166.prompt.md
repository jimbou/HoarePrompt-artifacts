Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer equal to the number of test cases, custos is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    custo = 0
    num_fila = 0
    max_p = 0
    a_values = []
    b_values = []
    nf = input().split()
    num_fila = int(nf[0])
    max_p = int(nf[1])
    a = input().split()
    b = input().split()
    for y in a:
        a_values.append(int(y))
    for y in b:
        b_values.append(int(y))
    for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
        if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
            custo += a_values[y]
        else:
            custo += b_values[y]
    for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
        if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
            custo += b_values[y]
            if y == 1:
                custo += a_values[0]
                break
        else:
            custo += a_values[y]
            break
    custos.append(custo)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element `custo` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custos` is a list of integers. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, then `custos` is updated to include the first element of `b_values` from the third line of stdin. Otherwise, `custos` is updated to include the first element of `a_values`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `custos` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p - 1` to 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
