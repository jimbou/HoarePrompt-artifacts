Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. The current value of `a_values[max_p - 2] + b_values[max_p - 1]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a_values[max_p - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `custo` has been increased by the value of `b_values[max_p - 1]`, which is the element at index `max_p - 1` in the list `b_values`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `a_values[max_p - 2] + b_values[max_p - 1]` is still less than or equal to `a_values[max_p - 1]`.
