Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by the second element of `b_values`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `a` is still an empty list, `num_fila` is still greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is still an integer greater than 1, `a_values` and `b_values` are still lists of integers from the second and third lines of stdin plus all elements in `a` and `b` respectively, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is still an empty list, `y` is still 1, and `custo` has been increased by the second element of `b_values`.
