Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer less than or equal to `y + 1`, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y`, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains greater than 2, `i` remains 2, `a` and `b` are still lists of integers, `num_fila` is still greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is still less than or equal to `y + 1`, `a_values` and `b_values` are still lists containing all elements of `a` and `b` as integers respectively, `y` is still `num_fila - 3`, but `custos` has been increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y`, and `nf` remains a list of strings. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.
