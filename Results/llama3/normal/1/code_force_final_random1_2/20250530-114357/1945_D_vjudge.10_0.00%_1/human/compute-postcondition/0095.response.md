Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element appended to it plus all elements in `a`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custos` has an additional element `a_values[y]` appended to it. Otherwise, `custos` is increased by `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, then `custos` is increased by `a_values[0]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, then `custos` is increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element appended to it plus all elements in `a`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custos` has an additional element `a_values[y]` appended to it. Otherwise, `custos` is increased by `b_values[y]`. Additionally, `custos` has an additional element `a_values[y]` appended to it.***
