Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p`.**

The loop has finished executing because `b` is now an empty list, indicating that all its elements have been processed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
