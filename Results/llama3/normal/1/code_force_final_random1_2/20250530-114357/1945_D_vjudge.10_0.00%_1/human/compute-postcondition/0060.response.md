The only variable in the loop head is variable  y and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `y` is the first element in `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `a` must have at least 2 elements and `y` is the second element in `a`. Also, `x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus the first element in `a`.
State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `y` is the second element in `a`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus the first element in `a`.**
