The only object in the loop head is variable  y and list  b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list b.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, b has at least 1 element, y is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the y is the second element in the list.
State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus the first element of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in `b`.**
