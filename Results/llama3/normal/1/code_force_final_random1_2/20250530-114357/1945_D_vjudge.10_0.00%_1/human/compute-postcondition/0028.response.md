To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`

The variables involved in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

According to the loop head, the loop will execute as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`. Since the loop is decrementing `y` by 1 in each iteration (due to the `-1` step), we need to adjust the state of `y` to be one less than its current value.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 2`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we decrement `y` by 1:

`y` is now `num_fila - 3`

The other variables in the loop head, `num_fila` and `max_p`, do not need to be adjusted, as their values do not change based on the loop iteration.

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3**
