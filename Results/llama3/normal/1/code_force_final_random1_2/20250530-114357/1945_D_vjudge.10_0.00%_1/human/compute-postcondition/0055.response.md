Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element `custo` appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the `custos` list has an additional element `custo` appended to it. The values of all other variables remain the same.
