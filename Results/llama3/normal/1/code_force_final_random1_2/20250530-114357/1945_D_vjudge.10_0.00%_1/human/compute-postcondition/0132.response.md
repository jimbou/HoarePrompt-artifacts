Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is set to `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is set to `b_values[num_fila - 1]`.**
