Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is greater than 0, i is 0, custos is an empty list, num_fila is the first integer from the first line of stdin, max_p is the second integer from the first line of stdin, a_values is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, b_values is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, custo is 0.
Code of the loop:
for y in a:
    a_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `y` is the first element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a` plus the second element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `y` is the second element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a` plus the second element in `a` plus the third element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `y` is the third element in `a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
