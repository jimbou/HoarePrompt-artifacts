Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `y` is the first element in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `a` is still a list of integers with at least one element, `custos` is still an empty list, `num_fila` and `max_p` are still the first and second integers from the first line of stdin respectively, `b_values` is still a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is still 0, and `y` is still the first element in `a`. The only change is that `a_values` now includes the first element of `a` in addition to the list of integers from the second line of stdin.
