Output State: **x is an integer equal to the number of test cases, custos is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the first line of stdin to `x`. This value represents the number of test cases. The second line initializes an empty list called `custos`. No other variables are affected. The state of stdin remains the same, containing multiple test cases, each with three lines of input.
