Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `nf` is a list of strings, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `max_p - 2` plus the value of `a_values` at index 0 if `y` is 1, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `max_p - 2`. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by the value of `a_values` at index `y`.**
