Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is a list of integers increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`. The current value of `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a_values[y]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `custos` has been increased by the value of `b_values[max_p - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` and `a_values[y]` is still valid.
