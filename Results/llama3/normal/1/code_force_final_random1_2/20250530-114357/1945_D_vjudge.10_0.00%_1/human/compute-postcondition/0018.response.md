To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute as long as `num_fila - 1` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`. This is because the loop iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` with a step of -1.
2. Since `y` is the loop variable, it will take on the values from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` during each iteration.

Based on this analysis, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 1**
