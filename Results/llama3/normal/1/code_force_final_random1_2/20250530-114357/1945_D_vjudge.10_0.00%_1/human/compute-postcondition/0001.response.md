The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is an integer equal to the number of test cases, `custos` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `custos` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases**
