Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `y` is not defined.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all elements from `b` have been appended to `b_values`. The loop has finished executing because `b` is now an empty list, indicating that all its elements have been processed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
        custo += a_values[y]
    else:
        custo += b_values[y]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 1`. If the current value of `a_values[y]` is less than the current value of `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is equal to the current value of `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is equal to `b_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 2`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is equal to `a_values[y]` and has been incremented by `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is either `a_values[y] + b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, or `2 * b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is not less than `b_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `a_values[num_fila - 3]`. Otherwise, `custos` is a list with one element which is the sum of the first element of `b` and the first element of `b_values`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
