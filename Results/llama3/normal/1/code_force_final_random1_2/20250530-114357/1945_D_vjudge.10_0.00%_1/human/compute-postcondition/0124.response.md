Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing the first four elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element of `b`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `b_values` has been updated to include the third element of `b` as an integer, which is `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
