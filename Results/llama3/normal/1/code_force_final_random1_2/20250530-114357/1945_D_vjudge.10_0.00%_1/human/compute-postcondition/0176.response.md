Output State: **`x` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `x`, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `custos` is an empty list, and all elements in `custos` have been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all elements in the `custos` list have been printed, and the `custos` list is now empty. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
