Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings. If `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by `a_values[0] + b_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]`.***
