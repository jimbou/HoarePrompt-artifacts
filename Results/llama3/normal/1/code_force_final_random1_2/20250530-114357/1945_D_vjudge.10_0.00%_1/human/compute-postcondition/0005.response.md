To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for y in a:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `y` is the first element in `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element, and `y` must be the next element in `a`.

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `y` is the second element in `a`**
