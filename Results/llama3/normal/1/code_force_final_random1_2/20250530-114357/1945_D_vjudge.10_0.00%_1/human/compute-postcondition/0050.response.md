Output State: **x is greater than 0, i is 0, a is an empty list, num_fila is greater than max_p, max_p is an integer that must be greater than 1, a_values is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in a, b_values is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, b is an empty list, y is 1, custo is increased by the sum of the first element of a_values and the second element of b_values.**

The code snippet has the following effects on the initial state:

*   The value of `custo` is increased by the first element of `a_values`.
*   The `break` statement terminates the loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it does not have any effect in this context.
*   All other variables remain unchanged.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, with the value of `custo` updated to reflect the increase by the first element of `a_values`.
