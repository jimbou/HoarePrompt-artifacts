Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is set to `a_values[y] + a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is set to `b_values[num_fila - 1] + a_values[y]`.**

In this output state, the value of `custo` has been updated by adding `a_values[y]` to its previous value. The previous value of `custo` was either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[num_fila - 1]`, depending on the comparison between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
