Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer less than or equal to `y + 1`, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the yth element of `a_values`, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `a` is still a list of integers, `num_fila` is still an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is still an integer less than or equal to `y + 1`, `a_values` is still a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is still a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is still a list of integers, `y` is still `num_fila - 3`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the yth element of `a_values`, `nf` is still a list of strings, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.
