According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `custos`. If `custos` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `custos` has at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in `custos`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `custos` must have at least 2 elements and `c` is the second element in `custos`.
State: **`x` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `x`, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `custos` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element in `custos`**
