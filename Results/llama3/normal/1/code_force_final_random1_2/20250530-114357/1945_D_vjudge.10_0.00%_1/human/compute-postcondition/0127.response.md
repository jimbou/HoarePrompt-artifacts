To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `num_fila` and `max_p`. For the loop to execute, `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`. Additionally, since `y` is the loop variable, it will take on values from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` (inclusive) in each iteration.

State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines**
