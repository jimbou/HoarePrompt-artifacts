Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list. If `y` is 1, `custos` is a list of integers increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]` plus `a_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custos` is a list of integers increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]`.***
