Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `custo` is equal to `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is equal to `b_values[y]`, and `custo` has been incremented by `a_values[y]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `a` and `custos` are still empty lists, `num_fila` is still greater than `max_p`, and `max_p` is still an integer. The lists `a_values` and `b_values` remain the same, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. The list `b` is unchanged, and `y` is still equal to `num_fila - 2`. The value of `custo` has been incremented by `a_values[y]`, and its new value depends on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`.
