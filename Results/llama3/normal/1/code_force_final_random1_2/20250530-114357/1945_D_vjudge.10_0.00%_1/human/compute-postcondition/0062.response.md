The only variable in the loop head is variable  y and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, y is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the y is the third element in the list.
State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a` and the second element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `y` is the third element in `a`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus the first element in `a` and the second element in `a`.**
