Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is a list with one element which is the sum of the first element of `b` and the first element of `b_values`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3**

Explanation: The code `custo += b_values[y]` adds the value of `b_values[y]` to the list `custos`. Since `y` is equal to `num_fila - 3`, we can substitute this value into the expression. The value of `b_values[y]` is the first element of `b_values` because `y` is 0. The first element of `b_values` is the first element of `b` because `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`. Therefore, the value added to `custos` is the sum of the first element of `b` and the first element of `b_values`. The other variables remain unchanged.
