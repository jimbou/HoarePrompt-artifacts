Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custos` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]` if `y` is not 1, otherwise `custo` is increased by `a_values[0] + b_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custos` has the element at index `y - 1` of `a_values` added to it.***
