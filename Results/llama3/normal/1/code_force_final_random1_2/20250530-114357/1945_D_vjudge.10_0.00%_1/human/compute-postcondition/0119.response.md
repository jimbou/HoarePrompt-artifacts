To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `y` and the list `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If `b` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `y` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the first element of `b` at the start of the loop.

State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element of `b`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings**
