Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus the first element in `b` and the second element in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in `b`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus all elements in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `b_values` now includes the second element of `b` as an integer, which is `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
