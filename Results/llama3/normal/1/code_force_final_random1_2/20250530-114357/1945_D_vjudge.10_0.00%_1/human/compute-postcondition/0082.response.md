To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is greater than `max_p`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, and `max_p` is an integer.

For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decreased by 1 (since the loop iterates in reverse order), so `y` becomes `num_fila - 3`. The values of `num_fila` and `max_p` remain the same.

State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element appended to it plus all elements in `a`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custos` has an additional element `a_values[y]` appended to it. Otherwise, `custos` is increased by `b_values[y]`.**
