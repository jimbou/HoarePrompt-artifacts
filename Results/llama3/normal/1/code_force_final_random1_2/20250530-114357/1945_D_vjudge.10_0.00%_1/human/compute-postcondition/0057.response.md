Output State: **x is greater than 1, i is 1, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, num_fila is an integer, max_p is an integer, a_values is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, b_values is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, b is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, y is 0, custos is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in b_values that satisfy the condition a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y] or the element at index y in a_values if the condition is not satisfied, and custos has an additional element 0 appended to it.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `y`, and `custos` are updated based on the input from stdin and the operations performed in the code. The lists `a`, `b`, `a_values`, and `b_values` are populated with integers from the input lines. The `custos` list is extended with an additional element `0` as specified in the code.
