Output State: `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `b` is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `y` is the last element in `b`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop (`x`, `i`, `a`, `custos`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `stdin`, `custo`) remain unchanged. The list `b_values` now includes all elements from the third line of stdin plus all elements from the list `b`. The list `b` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop. The variable `y` is the last element in the list `b`.
