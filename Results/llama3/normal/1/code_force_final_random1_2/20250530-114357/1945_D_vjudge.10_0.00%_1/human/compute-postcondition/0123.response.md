To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for y in b:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `y` and `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If `b` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `b` has at least 2 elements, and `y` is the second element of `b`.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must have at least 3 elements, and `y` must be the third element of `b`.

State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing the first three elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element of `b`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.**
