The only variable in the loop head is variable  y and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 1 element, y is the first element of a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the y is the second element of a.
State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the first two elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the second element of `a`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings**
