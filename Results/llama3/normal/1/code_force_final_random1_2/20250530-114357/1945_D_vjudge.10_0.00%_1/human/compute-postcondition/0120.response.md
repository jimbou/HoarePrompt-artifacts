Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing the first element of `b` as an integer, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element of `b`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than 2, `i` remains 2, `a` is still a list of integers, `num_fila` is still an integer, `max_p` is still an integer, `a_values` still contains all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` now contains the first element of `b` as an integer, `b` is still a list of integers with at least one element, `y` is still the first element of `b`, `custos` is still a list of integers, `custo` is still 0, `nf` is still a list of strings, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.
