To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

According to the loop statement, `y` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `y - 1`.

The loop condition is `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`. Since `y` is decremented by 1, `max_p` must be less than or equal to `y + 1` for the loop to execute again.

`num_fila` is not modified in the loop head, so its state remains the same.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer less than or equal to `y + 1`, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.**
