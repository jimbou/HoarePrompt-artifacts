Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by two lists of n integers each. It calculates the minimum cost for each test case by comparing the values of the two lists and summing the minimum values. The function then prints the calculated minimum costs for all test cases.**
