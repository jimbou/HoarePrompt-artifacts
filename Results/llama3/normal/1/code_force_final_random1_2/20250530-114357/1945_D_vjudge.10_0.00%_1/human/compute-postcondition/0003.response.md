To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to have at least one element.

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `y` is the first element in `a`**
