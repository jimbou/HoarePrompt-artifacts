Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 1`. If the current value of `a_values[y]` is less than the current value of `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is equal to the current value of `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is equal to `b_values[y]`.***
