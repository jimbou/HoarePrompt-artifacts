Output State: **x is greater than 0, i is 0, a is an empty list, num_fila is greater than max_p, max_p is an integer that must be greater than 1, a_values is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in a, b_values is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, b is an empty list, y is 1, custo is increased by the value of a_values[y].**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line increments the value of `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`. Since `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by the second element of `a_values`. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

Note that the value of `custo` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot provide a specific value for it in the output state. However, we can state that it has been increased by the value of `a_values[y]`. 

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
