Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least len(a) elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than max_p, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in a, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in b, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custos` is a list of integers plus the first element of `b_values` from the third line of stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `custos` has been updated by adding the first element of `b_values` from the third line of stdin. The other variables remain unchanged.
