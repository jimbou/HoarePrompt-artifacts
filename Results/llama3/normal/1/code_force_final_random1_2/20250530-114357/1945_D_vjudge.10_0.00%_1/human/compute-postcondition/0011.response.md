Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus the first element of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `b` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element in `b`.**

The code appends the first element of `b` (which is `y`) to the list `b_values`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `b_values` is updated to include the first element of `b`.
