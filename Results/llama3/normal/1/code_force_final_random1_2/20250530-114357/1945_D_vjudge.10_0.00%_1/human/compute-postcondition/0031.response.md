Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `a_values[num_fila - 3]`. Otherwise, `custos` is a list with one element which is the sum of the first element of `b` and the first element of `b_values`.***
