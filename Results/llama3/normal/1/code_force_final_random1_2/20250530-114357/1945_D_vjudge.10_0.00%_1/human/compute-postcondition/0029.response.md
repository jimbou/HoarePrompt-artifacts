Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is a list containing the value of `a_values[num_fila - 3]`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains greater than 0, `i` is still 0, and `a` is an empty list. The list `custos` now contains the value of `a_values[num_fila - 3]`. The relationship between `num_fila` and `max_p` remains the same, with `num_fila` being greater than `max_p`. The values of `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `b`, and `y` also remain unchanged.
