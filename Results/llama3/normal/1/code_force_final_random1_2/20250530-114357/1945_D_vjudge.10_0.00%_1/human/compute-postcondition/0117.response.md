Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the first four elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the third element of `a`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings**

The code appends the integer value of `y` to the list `a_values`. Since `y` is the third element of `a`, this means that `a_values` now contains the first four elements of `a` as integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
