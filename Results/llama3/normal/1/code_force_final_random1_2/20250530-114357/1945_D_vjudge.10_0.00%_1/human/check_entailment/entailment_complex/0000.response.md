Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data for each test case, including the number of people in the queue (n) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), as well as the two lists of integers (a and b).

2. The program initializes a variable `custo` to 0, which will be used to store the minimum cost for each test case.

3. The program then iterates over the range from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` in reverse order, comparing the values of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo`; otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo`. This is correct because Kirill can choose to pay either `a_values[y]` to the person at position `y` or `b_values[y]` to each person from `y` to `max_p - 1`.

4. After the first loop, the program iterates over the range from `max_p - 1` to 0 in reverse order. For each `y`, it checks if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. If it is, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo` and continues to the next iteration. If it's not, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo` and breaks out of the loop. This is correct because Kirill can choose to pay either `a_values[y]` to the person at position `y` or `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` to the person at position `y - 1` and each person from `y` to `max_p - 1`.

5. After calculating the minimum cost for each test case, the program appends the cost to the `custos` list.

6. Finally, the program prints the calculated minimum costs for all test cases.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
