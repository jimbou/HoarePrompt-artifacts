Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, then if `y` is 1, `custos` is a list of integers increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]` plus `a_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custos` is a list of integers increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]`. Otherwise, `custos` is a list of integers with the element at index `y` in `a_values` added to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0. If `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by the first element of `a_values`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the first element of `b_values`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is incremented by the value of `a_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *x is greater than 0, i is 0, a is an empty list, num_fila is greater than max_p, max_p is an integer that must be greater than 1, a_values is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in a, b_values is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, b is an empty list, y is 1. If the sum of the first element of a_values and the second element of b_values is less than or equal to the second element of a_values, custo is increased by the sum of the first element of a_values and the second element of b_values. Otherwise, custo is increased by the value of the second element of a_values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
