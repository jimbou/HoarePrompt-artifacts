Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custos` is a list of integers. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, then `custos` is updated to include the first element of `b_values` from the third line of stdin. Otherwise, `custos` is updated to include the first element of `a_values`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `custos` list has been updated to include either the first element of `b_values` or the first element of `a_values`, depending on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`.
