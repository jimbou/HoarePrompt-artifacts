Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. The sum of the element at index `y - 1` of `a_values` and the element at index `y` of `b_values` is greater than the element at index `y` of `a_values`***
