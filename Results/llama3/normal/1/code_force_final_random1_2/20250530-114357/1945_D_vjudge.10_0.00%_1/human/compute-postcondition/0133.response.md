To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

According to the loop head, the loop will execute as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`. Since `y` is currently `num_fila - 1`, we need to adjust the state of `y` to be one less than its current value, i.e., `y` is `num_fila - 2`.

The state of `num_fila` and `max_p` remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is set to `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is set to `b_values[num_fila - 1]`.**
