Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the first three elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the second element of `a`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings**.

In this output state, the only change is that `a_values` now contains the first three elements of `a` as integers, instead of just the first two. This is because the code appends the integer value of `y`, which is the second element of `a`, to the `a_values` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
