To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If `b` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has at least 2 elements, and `y` is the second element in `b`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have at least 3 elements, and `y` must be the third element in `b`.

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus the first element of `b` and the second element of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `b` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element in `b`**
