Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element appended to it plus all elements in `a`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custos` has an additional element `a_values[y]` appended to it. Otherwise, `custos` is increased by `b_values[y]`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element appended to it plus all elements in `a`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custos` has an additional element `a_values[y]` appended to it. Otherwise, `custos` is increased by `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, then `custos` is increased by `a_values[0]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, then `custos` is increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element appended to it plus all elements in `a`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custos` has an additional element `a_values[y]` appended to it. Otherwise, `custos` is increased by `b_values[y]`. Additionally, `custos` has an additional element `a_values[y]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *x is greater than 1, i is 1, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least len(a) elements, num_fila is an integer greater than max_p, max_p is an integer greater than 1, a_values is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in a, b_values is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, b is an empty list, y is 0, custos is a list of integers. If a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y], then custos is increased by the sum of all elements in b_values that satisfy the condition a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y] or the element at index y in a_values if the condition is not satisfied, and custos has an additional element appended to it plus all elements in a. If a_values[y] is less than b_values[y], then custos has an additional element a_values[y] appended to it. Otherwise, custos is increased by b_values[y]. If y is 1, then custos is increased by a_values[0]. If a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y], then custos is increased by the sum of all elements in b_values that satisfy the condition a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y] or the element at index y in a_values if the condition is not satisfied, and custos has an additional element appended to it plus all elements in a. If a_values[y] is less than b_values[y], then custos has an additional element a_values[y] appended to it. Otherwise, custos is increased by b_values[y]. Additionally, custos has an additional element a_values[y] appended to it, and custos is increased by b_values[y].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least len(a) elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than max_p, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in a, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custos` is a list of integers. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, then `custos` is updated to include the first element of `b_values` from the third line of stdin. Otherwise, `custos` is updated to include the first element of `a_values`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
