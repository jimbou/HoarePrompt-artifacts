Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer less than or equal to `y + 1`, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the yth element of `a_values`. Otherwise, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y`.***
