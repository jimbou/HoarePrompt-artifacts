Output State: **`x` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `x`, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p - 1` to 1 for each test case, and stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the initial number of test cases `x`. The lists `a`, `a_values`, `b`, and `b_values` will be empty. The variables `num_fila`, `max_p`, `nf`, and `y` will retain their last values. The list `custos` will contain the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p - 1` to 1 for each test case. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
