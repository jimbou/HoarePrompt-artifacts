Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `custos` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p - 1` to 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `i`, `a`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `b`, `y`, and `nf` remain unchanged. The only change is that `custos` has been increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p - 1` to 1. This means that `custos` now contains an additional value that represents the total cost calculated based on the given conditions. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, indicating that some input has been processed, but there are still more test cases to be processed.
