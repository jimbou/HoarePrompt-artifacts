To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `max_p`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `max_p` is greater than 1. 

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`**
