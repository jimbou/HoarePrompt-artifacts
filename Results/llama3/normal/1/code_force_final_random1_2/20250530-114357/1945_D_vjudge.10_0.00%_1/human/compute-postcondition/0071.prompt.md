Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `y` is the last element in `a`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus all elements in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for y in b:
    b_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus the first element in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element in `b`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus all elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus the first element in `b` and the second element in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in `b`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus all elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus the first element in `b`, the second element in `b`, the third element in `b`, and the third element in `b` again, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element in `b`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus all elements in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
