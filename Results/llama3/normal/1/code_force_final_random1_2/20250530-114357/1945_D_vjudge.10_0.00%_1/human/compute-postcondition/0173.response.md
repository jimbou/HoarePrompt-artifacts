The only object in the loop head is variable `c` and list `custos`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `custos`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `custos` has at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and `c` is the third element in the list.
State: **`x` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `x`, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `custos` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element in `custos`**
