The only variable in the loop head is variable  y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0, `max_p` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `y` must be greater than 0. Since the loop iterates in reverse order, `y` must be 1.
State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 1.**
