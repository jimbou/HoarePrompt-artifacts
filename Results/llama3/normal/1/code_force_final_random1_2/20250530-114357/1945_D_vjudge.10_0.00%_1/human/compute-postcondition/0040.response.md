Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is a list of integers with the element at index `y` in `a_values` added to it, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`.**

The code adds the element at index `y` in `a_values` to `custos`, and then breaks out of the loop. The values of `x`, `i`, `a`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `b`, and `y` remain unchanged.
