To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which is the variable `c` and the list `custos`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `custos`. If the list `custos` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

Since `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p - 1` to 1 for each test case, and stdin contains no test cases, we can assume that `custos` is empty.

However, for the loop to execute, `custos` must have at least 1 element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `custos` to have at least 1 element.

Additionally, since `c` is the loop variable, we can assume that it will take the value of the first element in `custos` during the first iteration.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`x` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `x`, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `custos` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in `custos`**
