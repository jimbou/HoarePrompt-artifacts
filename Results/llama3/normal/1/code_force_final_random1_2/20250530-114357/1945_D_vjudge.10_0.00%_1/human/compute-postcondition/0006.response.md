Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a` plus the second element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `y` is the second element in `a`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `a_values` now includes the second element of `a` (which is `y`) in addition to the integers from the second line of stdin and the first element of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
