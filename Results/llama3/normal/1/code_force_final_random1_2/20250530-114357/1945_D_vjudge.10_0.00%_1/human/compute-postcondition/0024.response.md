To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

According to the loop head, the loop will execute again if `y` is greater than `max_p - 1`. Since `y` is currently `num_fila - 1`, we need to adjust `y` to be `num_fila - 2` for the loop to execute again.

The state of `num_fila` and `max_p` does not need to be adjusted, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 2`. If the current value of `a_values[y]` is less than the current value of `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is equal to the current value of `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is equal to `b_values[y]`.**
