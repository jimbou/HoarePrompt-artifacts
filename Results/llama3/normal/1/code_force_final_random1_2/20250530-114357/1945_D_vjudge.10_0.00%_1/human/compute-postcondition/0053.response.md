Postcondition: ***x is greater than 0, i is 0, a is an empty list, num_fila is greater than max_p, max_p is an integer that must be greater than 1, a_values is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in a, b_values is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, b is an empty list, y is 1. If the sum of the first element of a_values and the second element of b_values is less than or equal to the second element of a_values, custo is increased by the sum of the first element of a_values and the second element of b_values. Otherwise, custo is increased by the value of the second element of a_values.***
