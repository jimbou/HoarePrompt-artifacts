Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus the first element of `b`, the second element of `b`, and the third element of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `b` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element in `b`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `b_values` now includes the third element of `b` (which is `y`) in addition to the first element of `b`, the second element of `b`, and the list of integers from the third line of stdin.
