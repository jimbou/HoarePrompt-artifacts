Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custos` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]` if `y` is not 1, otherwise `custo` is increased by `a_values[0] + b_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custos` has the element at index `y - 1` of `a_values` added to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `nf` is a list of strings, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `max_p - 2` plus the value of `a_values` at index 0 if `y` is 1, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `max_p - 2`. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by the value of `a_values` at index `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *x is greater than 2, i is 2, a is a list of integers, num_fila is an integer, max_p is an integer greater than 1, a_values is a list containing all elements of a as integers, b_values is a list containing all elements of b as integers, b is a list of integers, nf is a list of strings, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y], then if y is 1, custo is increased by the value of a_values at index 0 plus the value of b_values at index 2. Otherwise, custo is increased by the value of b_values at index 2. Otherwise, custo is increased by the value of a_values[y].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
