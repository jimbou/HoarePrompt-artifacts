Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that all elements of list `b` have been appended to `b_values` as integers, and `y` is now the last element of `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
        custo += a_values[y]
    else:
        custo += b_values[y]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is set to `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is set to `b_values[num_fila - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is set to `a_values[y] + a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is set to `b_values[num_fila - 1] + a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is not less than `b_values[y]` and `custo` is set to `a_values[y] + b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]` but `custo` was set to `a_values[y]` before. Otherwise, `custo` is set to `b_values[num_fila - 1] + b_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer less than or equal to `y + 1`, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the yth element of `a_values`. Otherwise, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
