Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is 1, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, `custo` is increased by `b_values[0]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines. The current value of `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a_values[1]`.***
