Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element in `b`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element 0 appended to it plus all elements in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The value of `x` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, containing integers from the second line of stdin with at least `len(a)` elements.
- The values of `num_fila` and `max_p` remain unchanged as integers.
- The list `a_values` remains the same, containing integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`.
- The list `b_values` now contains all elements from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`.
- The `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.
- The list `b` is now empty.
- The variable `y` holds the last element in `b`, which is empty.
- The list `custos` has been updated to include the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied. Additionally, `custos` has an extra element 0 appended to it, plus all elements in `a`.
