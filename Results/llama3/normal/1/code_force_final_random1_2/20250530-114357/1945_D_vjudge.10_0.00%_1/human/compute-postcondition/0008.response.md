Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus the first element in `a` plus the second element in `a` plus the third element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `y` is the third element in `a`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `a` is still a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `custos` is still an empty list, `num_fila` and `max_p` are still the first and second integers from the first line of stdin, `b_values` is still a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, and `custo` is still 0. The only change is that `a_values` now includes the third element of `a` (which is also the value of `y`) in addition to the integers from the second line of stdin and the first two elements of `a`.
