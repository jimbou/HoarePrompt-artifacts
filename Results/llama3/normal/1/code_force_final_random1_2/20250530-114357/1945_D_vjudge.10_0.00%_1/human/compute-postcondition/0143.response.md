To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `max_p`. The loop will execute as long as `max_p` is greater than 1, because the range starts from `max_p - 1` and goes down to 1. The initial value of `y` should be `max_p - 1` for the loop to start.

State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custos` is a list of integers, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines**
