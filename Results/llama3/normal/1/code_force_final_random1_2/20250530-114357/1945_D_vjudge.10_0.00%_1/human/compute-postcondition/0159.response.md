Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is 2, `nf` is a list of strings, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `custo` has been updated by adding the value of `b_values` at index 2, which is the third element of the list `b_values`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.
