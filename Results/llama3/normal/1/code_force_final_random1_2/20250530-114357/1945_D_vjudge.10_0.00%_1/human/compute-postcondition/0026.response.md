Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `custo` is either `a_values[y] + b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, or `2 * b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is not less than `b_values[y]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `a` and `custos` are still empty lists, `num_fila` is still greater than `max_p`, and `max_p` is still an integer. The lists `a_values` and `b_values` are still composed of integers from the input and the lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, and `b` is still a list of integers. The value of `y` is still `num_fila - 2`. The value of `custo` has been updated to be either the sum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, or twice `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is not less than `b_values[y]`.
