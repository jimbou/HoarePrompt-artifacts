To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):`.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `y`. According to the code, `y` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be 0.

However, since the loop condition is `range(max_p - 1, 0, -1)`, the loop will only execute if `y` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `max_p` must be greater than 1, and `y` should be 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0**
