Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `a`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a_values` will contain all elements of `a` as integers, and `y` will be the last element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
