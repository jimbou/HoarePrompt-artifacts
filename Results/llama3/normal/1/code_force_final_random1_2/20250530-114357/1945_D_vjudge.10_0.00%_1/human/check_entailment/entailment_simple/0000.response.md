Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach the desired position in the queue. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of people in the queue, the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, and the values of a_i and b_i for each person.

2. The program initializes the cost to 0 and then iterates over the people in the queue from the end to the maximum allowable final position of Kirill. For each person, it checks if the cost of bribing the person (a_i) is less than the cost of moving past the person (b_i). If it is, it adds the cost of bribing the person to the total cost. Otherwise, it adds the cost of moving past the person to the total cost.

3. After that, the program iterates over the people in the queue from the maximum allowable final position of Kirill to the first person. For each person, it checks if the cost of bribing the person and moving past the next person is less than or equal to the cost of bribing the next person. If it is, it adds the cost of moving past the next person to the total cost. If it reaches the first person, it adds the cost of bribing the first person to the total cost.

4. The program repeats this process for each test case and stores the total cost for each test case in the `custos` list.

5. Finally, the program prints the total cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
