Output State: **x is greater than 0, i is 0, custos is an empty list, num_fila is the first integer from the first line of stdin, max_p is the second integer from the first line of stdin, a_values is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, b_values is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, custo is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains greater than 0, and `i` remains 0, as they are not modified by the code. The `custos` list remains empty, as no elements are added to it. The `num_fila` variable is assigned the value of the first integer from the first line of stdin, and `max_p` is assigned the value of the second integer from the same line. The `a_values` and `b_values` lists are populated with integers from the second and third lines of stdin, respectively. The `custo` variable is initialized to 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus the three lines that were read by the code.
