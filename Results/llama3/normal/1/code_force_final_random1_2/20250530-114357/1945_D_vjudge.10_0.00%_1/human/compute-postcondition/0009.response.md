Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `custos` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `custo` is 0, `y` is not defined.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop iterates over all elements in `a`, appending each element to `a_values`. After the loop finishes, `a` becomes an empty list because all its elements have been processed and appended to `a_values`. The variable `y` is no longer defined because it was only defined within the scope of the loop.
