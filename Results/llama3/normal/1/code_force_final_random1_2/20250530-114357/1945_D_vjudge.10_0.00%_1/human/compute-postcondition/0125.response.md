Output State: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing all elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list containing all elements of `b` as integers, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element of `b`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines.

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `b_values` now contains all elements of `b` as integers, and `y` is the last element of `b`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
