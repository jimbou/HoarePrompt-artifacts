To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`.

1. **`y`**: Since the loop iterates in reverse order (due to the `-1` step), `y` will decrease by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `y` will be `num_fila - 2`.

2. **`num_fila`**: This variable is not modified within the loop head, so its state remains the same.

3. **`max_p`**: Like `num_fila`, `max_p` is not modified within the loop head, so its state remains unchanged.

The other variables (`x`, `i`, `a`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `b`, and `custos`) are not part of the loop head, so their states are not adjusted for the purpose of determining the next iteration's state.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration is focused solely on the change in `y`.

State: **`x` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers from the second line of stdin plus all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers from the third line of stdin plus all elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `custos` is a list of integers increased by the sum of all elements in `b_values` that satisfy the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` or the element at index `y` in `a_values` if the condition is not satisfied, and `custos` has an additional element appended to it plus all elements in `a`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custos` has an additional element `a_values[y]` appended to it. Otherwise, `custos` is increased by `b_values[y]`.**
