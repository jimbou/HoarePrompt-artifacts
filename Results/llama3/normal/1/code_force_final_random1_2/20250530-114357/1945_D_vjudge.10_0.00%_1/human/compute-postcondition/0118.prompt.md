Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is greater than 2, i is 2, a is a list of integers from the second line of stdin, num_fila is an integer, max_p is an integer, a_values is an empty list, b_values is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, b is a list of integers from the third line of stdin, y is 0, custos is a list of integers, custo is 0, nf is a list of strings from the first line of stdin
Code of the loop:
for y in a:
    a_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the first element of `a` as an integer, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the first element of `a`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the first three elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the second element of `a`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the first four elements of `a` as integers, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines, `b` is a list of integers, `y` is the third element of `a`, `custos` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
