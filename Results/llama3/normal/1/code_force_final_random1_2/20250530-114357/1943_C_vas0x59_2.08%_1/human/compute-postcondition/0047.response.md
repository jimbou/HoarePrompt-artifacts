Output: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, `d` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing all vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `a`, `n` is -1. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples (`c`, i) for all i from 0 to `ci`, where `ci` is the index of the middle vertex in `path_ba`, `c` is the middle vertex in `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing 2 * (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1) tuples: (c1, i) and (c2, i), where c2 is half of the length of path_ba, c1 is one less than c2 and less than half of the length of path_ba, and i is len(path_ba) - c1 - 1. and the length of `ops` is being printed**
