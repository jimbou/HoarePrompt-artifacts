Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, stdin contains -n+1 inputs**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, but the list `u2vs` has been updated to contain all the edges read from the standard input. Each edge is represented by a pair of vertices `(u,v)`, and for each such pair, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` contains `u`. The standard input has been consumed, and its contents are no longer available.
