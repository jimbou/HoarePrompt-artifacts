The code prints a list of operations in the form of "vertex index operation index" where the vertex index is one more than the actual vertex index and the operation index is the index of the operation.

The operations are determined by the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `a`. If the length of this path is odd, the operations are performed on the middle vertex. If the length of the path is even, the operations are performed on the two vertices that are roughly in the middle of the path.

The exact output depends on the specific values of `path_ba`, `a`, and `b`, which are not provided in the initial state. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a list of operations in the specified format.

Output: **A list of operations in the form of "vertex index operation index" where the vertex index is one more than the actual vertex index and the operation index is the index of the operation, determined by the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `a`.**
