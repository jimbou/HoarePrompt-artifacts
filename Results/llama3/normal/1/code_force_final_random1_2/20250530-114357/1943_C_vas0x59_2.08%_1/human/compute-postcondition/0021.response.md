Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, `d` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing vertex `b` and the previous vertex of `path_ba[-1]` in the shortest path from the source vertex, and `n` is the previous vertex of `path_ba[-1]` in the shortest path from the source vertex, which is either -1 or a vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex to `b`. If `n` is -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `n` has been updated to be the previous vertex of `path_ba[-1]` in the shortest path from the source vertex. If `n` is -1, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program will continue execution.
