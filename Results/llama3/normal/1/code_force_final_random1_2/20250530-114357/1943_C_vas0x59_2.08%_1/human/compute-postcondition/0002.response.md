Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, stdin contains -1 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `u2vs` is modified by appending `v` to the list at index `u` and `u` to the list at index `v`. The stdin is now empty as it initially contained 0 inputs and 2 inputs were read by the code.
