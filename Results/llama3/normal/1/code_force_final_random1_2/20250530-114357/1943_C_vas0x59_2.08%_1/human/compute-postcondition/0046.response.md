The code prints the length of the `ops` list, which contains tuples representing operations to be performed on the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `a`.

If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples (`c`, `i`) for all `i` from 0 to `ci`, where `ci` is the index of the middle vertex in `path_ba`, `c` is the middle vertex in `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`. In this case, the length of `ops` is equal to `ci` + 1.

If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains 2 * (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1) tuples: (c1, i) and (c2, i), where c2 is half of the length of path_ba, c1 is one less than c2 and less than half of the length of path_ba, and i is len(path_ba) - c1 - 1. In this case, the length of `ops` is equal to 2 * (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1).

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of len(ops). However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the length of the `ops` list.

Output: **length of ops (where ops is the list of operations to be performed on the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a)**
