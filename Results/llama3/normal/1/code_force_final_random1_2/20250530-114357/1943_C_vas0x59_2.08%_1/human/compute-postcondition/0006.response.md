Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 3, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains an additional edge (u,v) and (v,u), stdin contains -2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of n remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list u2vs is updated to include the additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) at their respective indices. The stdin now contains -2 inputs as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
