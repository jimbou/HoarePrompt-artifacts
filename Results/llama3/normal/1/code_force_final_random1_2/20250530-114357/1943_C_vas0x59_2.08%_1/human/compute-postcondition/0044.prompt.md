Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, `d` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing all vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `a`, `n` is -1, `ops` is an empty list, `c2` is half of the length of `path_ba`, and `c1` is one less than `c2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, d is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing all vertices in the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a and must have at least 3 elements, n is -1, ops is a list containing two tuples: (c1, i) and (c2, i), c2 is half of the length of path_ba, c1 is one less than c2 and less than half of the length of path_ba, and i is len(path_ba) - c1 - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, d is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing all vertices in the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a and must have at least 3 elements, n is -1, ops is a list containing four tuples: (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), and (c2, i), c2 is half of the length of path_ba, c1 is one less than c2 and less than half of the length of path_ba, and i is len(path_ba) - c1 + 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, d is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing all vertices in the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a and must have at least 3 elements, n is -1, ops is a list containing six tuples: (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), and (c2, i), c2 is half of the length of path_ba, c1 is one less than c2 and less than half of the length of path_ba, and i is len(path_ba) - c1 + 1, i is len(path_ba) - c1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
