Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, `d` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing vertex `b`, `n` is the previous vertex of the last vertex in the shortest path from `b` to `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of vertices and their neighbors, the distances from the source vertex, the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, the vertex with the maximum distance from the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, and the path from the vertex with the maximum distance from the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex to the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex are all unchanged. The variable `n` now holds the value of the previous vertex of the last vertex in the shortest path from `b` to `a`.
