Output State: **u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, d is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing all vertices in the shortest path from vertex b to vertex a and must have at least 3 elements, n is -1, ops is a list containing four tuples: (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), and (c2, i), c2 is half of the length of path_ba, c1 is one less than c2 and less than half of the length of path_ba, and i is len(path_ba) - c1 + 1**

The code appends two new tuples to the `ops` list, which already contains two tuples. The new tuples have the same values as the existing tuples: `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`. The values of `c1`, `c2`, and `i` are determined based on the length of the `path_ba` list. Specifically, `c2` is half of the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is one less than `c2`, and `i` is `len(path_ba) - c1 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
