Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, `d` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing vertex `b` and `n`. If `n` is -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**
