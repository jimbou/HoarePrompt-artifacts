The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 2 and `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `stdin` contains -1 inputs**
