Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, u2vs is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, stdin is empty, d is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, a is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, previous is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, b is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex a, path_ba is a list containing vertex b**.

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The list `u2vs` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The stdin is empty, as all inputs have been read. The variable `d` is a dictionary where the keys are vertices and the values are distances from the source vertex. The variable `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex. The variable `previous` is a dictionary where the keys are vertices and the values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex. The variable `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`. The list `path_ba` contains only vertex `b`.
