Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u and also contains additional edges (u,v) and (v,u) for all pairs of vertices (u,v) that were read from stdin, `d` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are distances from the source vertex, `a` is the vertex with the maximum distance from the source vertex, `previous` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are the previous vertex in the shortest path from the source vertex, `b` is the vertex with the maximum distance from vertex `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing all vertices in the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `a` with an odd number of vertices, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (`c`, 0), (`c`, 1), and (`c`, 2), `ci` is greater than 1, `c` is the middle vertex in `path_ba`, `i` is 2**.

In this output state, the only change is that the list `ops` now contains an additional tuple (`c`, 2), which was appended by the code. All other variables remain unchanged.
