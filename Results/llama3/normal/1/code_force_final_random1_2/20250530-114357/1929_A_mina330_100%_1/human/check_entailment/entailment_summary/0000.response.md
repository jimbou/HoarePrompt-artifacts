Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order and prints the difference between the largest and smallest integers in each test case.

The key insight to this problem is that the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and the largest difference will always be between the largest and smallest elements.

The program correctly implements this insight by sorting the integers in ascending order and printing the difference between the largest and smallest integers in each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
