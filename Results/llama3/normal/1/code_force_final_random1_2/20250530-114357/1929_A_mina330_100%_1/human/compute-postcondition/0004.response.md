Output: **ntest is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, itest is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), stdin contains ntest - 1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the difference between the last element and the first element of the list a is being printed**
