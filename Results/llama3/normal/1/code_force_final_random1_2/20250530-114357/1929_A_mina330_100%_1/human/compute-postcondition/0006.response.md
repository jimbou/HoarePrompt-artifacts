Output State: **ntest is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, itest is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), stdin contains ntest - 3 test cases.**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n, which was previously an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. The new value of n is also an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, assigns it to a, and sorts the list. The list a was previously a sorted list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and it remains a sorted list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) after the code executes. The value of itest remains unchanged at 2. The value of ntest remains unchanged between 0 and 499 inclusive. Stdin initially contained ntest - 2 test cases, and after the code reads two inputs, it contains ntest - 3 test cases.
