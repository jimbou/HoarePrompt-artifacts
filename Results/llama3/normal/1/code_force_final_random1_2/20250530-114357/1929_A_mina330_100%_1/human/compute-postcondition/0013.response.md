Output State: **ntest is 0, itest is ntest, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), stdin contains 0 test cases, and the difference between the last and first element of the sorted list a is being printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases (`ntest`) will be 0, the loop counter (`itest`) will be equal to the initial number of test cases, the list `a` will be sorted and contain `n` integers, and there will be no more test cases left in the standard input (`stdin`). The loop will have printed the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the list `a` for each test case.
