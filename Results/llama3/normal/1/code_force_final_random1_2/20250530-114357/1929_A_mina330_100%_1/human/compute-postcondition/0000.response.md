Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `ntest` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, `ntest` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin now contains `ntest` test cases, each consisting of an integer n and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of n and a_i are still valid as specified in the initial state.
