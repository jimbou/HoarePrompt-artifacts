Output State: **ntest is an integer between 3 and 499 inclusive, itest is 3, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), stdin contains ntest - 4 test cases, and the difference between the last and first element of the sorted list a is being printed**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, making `n` equal to the input value. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`, making `a` equal to the list of integers. The third line sorts the list `a` in ascending order.

The initial state provides the following information: `ntest` is an integer between 3 and 499 inclusive, `itest` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `stdin` contains `ntest - 3` test cases, and the difference between the last and first element of the sorted list `a` is being printed.

After the code executes, the following changes occur:

*   `n` is updated to the integer value of the input.
*   `a` is updated to the list of integers from stdin.
*   The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
*   `stdin` now contains `ntest - 4` test cases, as two inputs have been consumed.

The final state includes all the information from the initial state that remains valid after the code execution, along with the updated values of the variables that are modified by the code.
