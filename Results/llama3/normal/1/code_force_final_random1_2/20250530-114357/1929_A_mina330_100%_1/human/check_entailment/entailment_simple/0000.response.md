Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then prints the difference between the last and first elements. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by placing the smallest element first and the largest element last, and then arranging the remaining elements in ascending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The program correctly implements this approach by sorting the array and then printing the difference between the last and first elements.

Correctness: **True**
