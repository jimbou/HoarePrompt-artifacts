Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then prints the difference between the last element and the first element. This approach is incorrect because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, whereas the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. This can be done by iterating through the sorted array and adding the difference between each pair of consecutive elements to a running total.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
