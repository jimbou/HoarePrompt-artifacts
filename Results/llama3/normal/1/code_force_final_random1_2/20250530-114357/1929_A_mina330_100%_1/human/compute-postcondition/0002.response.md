Output State: **ntest is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, itest is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), stdin contains ntest - 1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**

The code reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `a`. It then reads `n` integers from the input, stores them in the list `a`, and sorts the list in ascending order. The value of `ntest` is decremented by 1, and `itest` is incremented by 1. The remaining test cases in the input are left unchanged.
