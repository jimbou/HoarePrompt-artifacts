The code prints the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted list `a`.
Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and each element in `a` is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the last element of `a` is the maximum value in the list, and the first element of `a` is the minimum value in the list.
Output: **the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list a**
