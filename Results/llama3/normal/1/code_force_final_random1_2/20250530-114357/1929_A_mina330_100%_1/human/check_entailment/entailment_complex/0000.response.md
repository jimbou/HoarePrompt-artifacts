Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, the elements should be arranged in ascending order, so that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The given program correctly implements this approach. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then sorts the array in ascending order and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, and it processes all test cases as required. The use of the `sort` method to sort the array is efficient and correct.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
