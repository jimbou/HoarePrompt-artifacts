The code prints the difference between the last and first element of the sorted list `a`. The last element of the list `a` is `a[len(a) - 1]` and the first element of the list `a` is `a[0]`. Since the list `a` is sorted, the last element is the largest element in the list and the first element is the smallest element in the list. Therefore, the difference between the last and first element of the sorted list `a` is the difference between the largest and smallest element in the list.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest element in the sorted list a**
