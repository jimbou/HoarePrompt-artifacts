The code prints the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is the largest integer in the list, and the first element (`a[0]`) is the smallest integer in the list. Therefore, the printed value is the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list a**
