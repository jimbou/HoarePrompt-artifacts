To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `itest` and `ntest`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `itest` and `ntest`. If `itest` is less than `ntest`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 2, and `ntest` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `itest` must be increased by 1 (since the step size is 1), so `itest` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `ntest` must be greater than 3.

State: **`ntest` is an integer between 3 and 499 inclusive, `itest` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `stdin` contains `ntest - 3` test cases, and the difference between the last and first element of the sorted list `a` is being printed**
