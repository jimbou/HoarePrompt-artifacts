The code prints the sum of two values. The first value is 1 if the sum of the remainders of the first three elements of the list `p` divided by 2 is equal to 3, otherwise it is 0. The second value is the sum of all elements in the list `p` divided by 2.
Output: ** `_` is 1, `p` is a list of four integers (p_i = int(input()) - int(input()) % 2 for i = 1 to 4), stdin contains an integer t (2 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: (sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2 **
