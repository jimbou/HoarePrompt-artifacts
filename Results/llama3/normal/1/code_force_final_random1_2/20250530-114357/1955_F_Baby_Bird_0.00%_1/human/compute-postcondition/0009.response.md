Output State: **`_` is 2, `p` is a list of four even integers (p_i = int(input()) for i = 1 to 4), stdin contains an integer t (2 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-3 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: (sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged as 2. The list `p` is updated to contain four even integers, which are the result of reading four integers from the input and subtracting the remainder of dividing each integer by 2. The stdin still contains an integer t followed by t-3 lines, each containing four integers p_i. The printed expression remains the same, but now it is evaluated with the updated list `p`.
