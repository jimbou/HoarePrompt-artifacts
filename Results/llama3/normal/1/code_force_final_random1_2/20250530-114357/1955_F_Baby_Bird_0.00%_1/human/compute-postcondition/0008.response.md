The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, int(input()) is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again int(input()) must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **_ is 2, `p` is a list of four integers (p_i = int(input()) - int(input()) % 2 for i = 1 to 4), stdin contains an integer t (2 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-2 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: (sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2**
