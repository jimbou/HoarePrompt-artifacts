Let's break down the given code and initial state step by step to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the given print statement, so it doesn't affect the output).
- `p` is a list of four even integers, each in the range 0 <= p_i <= 200.
- The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the first three elements of `p` are all odd. However, since `p` consists of even integers, this condition will always be False.
- `sum(p)` calculates the sum of all elements in `p`.
- `sum(p) // 2` calculates the integer division of the sum of `p` by 2.

Given the print statement:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```
Since `p` contains even integers, the condition `x % 2 > 0` will always be False for all elements in `p`. Therefore, `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` will be 0, and the condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` will always be False, which is equivalent to 0 in a numeric context.

The expression `sum(p) // 2` calculates the sum of all elements in `p` divided by 2, but since `p` consists of even integers, this division will always result in an integer (because the sum of even numbers is always even).

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of adding 0 (from the False condition) to the integer division of the sum of `p` by 2.

Output: **0 + (sum of all elements in p divided by 2)**
