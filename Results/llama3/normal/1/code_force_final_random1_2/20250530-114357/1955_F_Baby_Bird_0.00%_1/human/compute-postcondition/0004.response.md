Let's analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 0. Since `int(input())` is not a variable that can be modified directly, we can only adjust the state of `_`.

State: **`_` is 1, `p` is a list of four even integers, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
