Output State: **`_` is 0, `p` is a list of four even integers, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `p` is assigned a list of four integers, each of which is an even number because the lambda function `lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2` subtracts the remainder of the integer division of `x` by 2 from `x`, effectively rounding down to the nearest even number. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` lines, each containing four integers `p_i`, and the constraint that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 remains valid.
