To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the components of the statement based on the initial state provided.

1. `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`:
   - `p` is a list of four even integers. This means all elements in `p` are divisible by 2 without any remainder.
   - `p[:3]` refers to the first three elements of `p`.
   - `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` applies a lambda function to each of the first three elements of `p`. The lambda function checks if the remainder of the division of `x` by 2 is greater than 0, which essentially checks if `x` is odd.
   - Since all elements in `p` are even, `x % 2 > 0` will always be `False` for all elements in `p[:3]`.
   - `list(...)` converts the map object to a list, so we have a list of `False` values.
   - `sum(...)` sums up the boolean values in the list. In Python, `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 when summed. Since all values are `False`, the sum is 0.
   - `== 3` compares the sum (which is 0) to 3, resulting in `False`.
   - In Python, `False` is treated as 0 when used in arithmetic operations, so `(sum(...) == 3)` contributes 0 to the overall sum.

2. `+ sum(p) // 2`:
   - `sum(p)` calculates the sum of all elements in `p`.
   - Since `p` contains four even integers, the sum of these integers is also even.
   - `// 2` performs integer division by 2, effectively halving the sum of `p` and rounding down to the nearest whole number.

Given that `p` is a list of four even integers, let's denote these integers as `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The sum of these integers is `a + b + c + d`, which is an even number because the sum of even numbers is always even.

Therefore, when we halve this sum using integer division (`// 2`), we get an integer result without any remainder.

The final output is the sum of the results from the two parts of the expression: the first part contributes 0 (because `False` is treated as 0), and the second part contributes the halved sum of the elements in `p`.

Output: **0 + (a + b + c + d) // 2 (where a, b, c, and d are the four even integers in list p)**
