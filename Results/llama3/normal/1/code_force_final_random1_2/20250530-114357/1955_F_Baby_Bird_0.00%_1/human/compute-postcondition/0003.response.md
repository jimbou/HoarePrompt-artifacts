Output: ** `_` is 0, `p` is a list of four even integers, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and this is printed: the sum of the first three elements of `p` modulo 2, plus the sum of all elements in `p` divided by 2**
