Output State: **`_` is 1, `p` is a list of four integers (p_i = int(input()) - int(input()) % 2 for i = 1 to 4), stdin contains an integer t (2 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The list `p` is updated to contain four integers, each of which is the result of subtracting the remainder of the division of the corresponding input integer by 2 from the input integer itself. This effectively rounds down each input integer to the nearest even number. The stdin now contains one less line than before, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The remaining lines in stdin still contain four integers each, with values between 0 and 200.
