Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the first three integers modulo 2, plus the sum of all four integers divided by 2, for each test case. The function repeats this process for a number of test cases specified by the first integer read from standard input.**
