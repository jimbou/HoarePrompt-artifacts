Output State: **The loop head variable `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, `p` is a list of four even integers, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by 0 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and the sum of the first three elements of `p` modulo 2, plus the sum of all elements in `p` divided by 2 is printed.**

This output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The loop head variable `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, which is the number of iterations minus one. The list `p` contains four even integers, which are the last four integers read from the input. The input stream `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by 0 lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), which means that all input lines have been read and processed. Finally, the sum of the first three elements of `p` modulo 2, plus the sum of all elements in `p` divided by 2 is printed, which is the result of the last iteration of the loop.
