Output: ** `_` is 2, `p` is a list of four even integers (p_i = int(input()) for i = 1 to 4), stdin contains an integer t (2 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-3 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: 0 + sum(p) // 2 because the first three elements of the list p are even integers, so the sum of the list of boolean values returned by the lambda function is 0, and the sum of the list p is divided by 2**
