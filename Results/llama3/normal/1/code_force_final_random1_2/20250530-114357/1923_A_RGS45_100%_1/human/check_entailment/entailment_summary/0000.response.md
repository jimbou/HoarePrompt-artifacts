Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the binary string `arr` representing the cells.
3. It finds the first occurrence of '1' in the binary string using `arr.find('1')` and stores the index in `x`. This gives the starting position of the first chip.
4. It finds the last occurrence of '1' in the binary string by reversing the string using `arr[::-1]` and finding the first occurrence of '1' using `arr[::-1].find('1')`. The index is then subtracted from `n` to get the ending position of the last chip.
5. It extracts the substring between the first and last chip using `arr[x:n - y]` and stores it in `z`.
6. It counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')` and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The execution summary also confirms that the program consumes all input and produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
