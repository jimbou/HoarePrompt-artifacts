Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 1) such that at least one `a_i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = ''.join(input('').split())
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, _ is 0, n is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), arr is a string of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, x is an integer representing the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer representing the index of the first '1' from the end of arr, z is a substring of arr starting from the first '1' to the end of arr minus the index of the first '1' from the end, and the number of '0' in z is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, n is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), arr is a string of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, x is an integer representing the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer representing the index of the first '1' from the end of arr, z is a substring of arr starting from the first '1' to the end of arr minus the index of the first '1' from the end, and the number of '0' in z is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, n is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), arr is a string of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, x is an integer representing the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer representing the index of the first '1' from the end of arr, z is a substring of arr starting from the first '1' to the end of arr minus the index of the first '1' from the end, and the number of '0' in z has been printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
