The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 1) such that at least one `a_i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 1) such that at least one `a_i` is 1, `_` is 0**
