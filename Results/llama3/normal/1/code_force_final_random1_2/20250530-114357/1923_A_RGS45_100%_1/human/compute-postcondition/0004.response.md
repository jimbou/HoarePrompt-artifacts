Output: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, _ is 0, n is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), arr is a string of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, x is an integer representing the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer representing the index of the first '1' from the end of arr, z is a substring of arr starting from the first '1' to the end of arr minus the index of the first '1' from the end, and the number of '0' in z is being printed**
