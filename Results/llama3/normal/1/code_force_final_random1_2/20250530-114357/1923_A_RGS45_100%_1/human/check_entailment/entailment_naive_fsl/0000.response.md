Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the left using `arr.find('1')` and stores it in `x`. This gives the starting position of the block of chips.

2. Then, it finds the index of the first '1' from the right using `arr[::-1].find('1')` and stores it in `y`. This gives the ending position of the block of chips.

3. The program then extracts the substring `z` from the original string `arr` starting from `x` and ending at `n - y`. This substring contains all the chips and the free cells between them.

4. Finally, the program counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')` and prints the result. This gives the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases, including when there are no free cells between the chips, when there are multiple blocks of chips, and when there are free cells at the beginning or end of the ribbon. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
