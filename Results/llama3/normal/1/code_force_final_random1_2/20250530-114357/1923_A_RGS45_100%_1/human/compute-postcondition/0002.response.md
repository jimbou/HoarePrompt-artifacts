Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, _ is 0, n is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), arr is a string of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, x is an integer representing the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer representing the index of the first '1' from the end of arr, z is a substring of arr starting from the first '1' to the end of arr minus the index of the first '1' from the end.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The second line reads a string of `n` space-separated integers from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. Since at least one of the integers is 1, `arr` contains at least one '1'. The third line finds the index of the first '1' in `arr` and assigns it to `x`. The fourth line finds the index of the first '1' from the end of `arr` and assigns it to `y`. The fifth line extracts a substring from `arr` starting from the first '1' to the end of `arr` minus the index of the first '1' from the end and assigns it to `z`. 

Note that `t` is still an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, but stdin now contains `t-1` test cases because one test case has been processed.
