Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n binary digits. It then finds the first and last occurrence of '1' in the binary string, extracts the substring between these two occurrences, and prints the count of '0's in this substring. The function repeats this process for each test case, ultimately consuming all input and producing the desired output.**
