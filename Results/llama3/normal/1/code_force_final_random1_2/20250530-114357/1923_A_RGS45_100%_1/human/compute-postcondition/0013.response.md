Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is t-1, n is an integer (2 <= n <= 50), arr is a string of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, x is an integer representing the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer representing the index of the first '1' from the end of arr, z is a substring of arr starting from the first '1' to the end of arr minus the index of the first '1' from the end, and the number of '0' in z has been printed t times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `_` will be equal to `t-1`, which is the number of iterations the loop has executed. The input stream `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases have been read and processed. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, and the number of '0' in `z` will have been printed `t` times.
