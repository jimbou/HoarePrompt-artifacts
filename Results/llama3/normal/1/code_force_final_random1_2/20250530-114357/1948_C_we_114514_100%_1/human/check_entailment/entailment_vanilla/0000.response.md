Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of columns `n`, and the two rows of arrows as input, and returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) and 'No' otherwise. `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  `func_1` calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`, which is correct since `n` is even.
2.  The function then iterates over the first `half_n - 1` pairs of columns (i.e., `2 * i` and `2 * i + 1` for `i` in range `half_n - 1`). For each pair, it checks if the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[2 * i + 1] == '<'`) and if the arrow in the second row points to the left in either the current column (`row2[2 * i] == '<'`) or the next column (`row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'`). If this condition is true, the function returns 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).
3.  After the loop, the function checks the last pair of columns (i.e., `n - 1` and `n - 2`). If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[n - 1] == '<'`) and the arrow in the second row points to the left in the second last column (`row2[n - 2] == '<'`), the function returns 'No'.
4.  If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
5.  `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. The conditions checked in `func_1` accurately determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the arrows in the grid.

Correctness: **True**
