Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve a problem where a robot moves in a grid with two rows and n columns, following certain rules based on the direction of arrows in each cell. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of columns), `row1`, and `row2` (strings representing the directions of the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively). It checks if the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) based on the given conditions. If the robot can move, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

`func_2` reads input, processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the provided parameters, and stores the results in a list. The function then prints the results as a newline-separated string.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2,n) based on the given conditions. It checks for specific conditions in the rows, and if any of these conditions are met, it immediately returns 'No'. If none of the conditions are met after checking all positions, it returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
