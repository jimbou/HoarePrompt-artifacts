The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is a list containing at least three elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, row1, row2)`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2**
