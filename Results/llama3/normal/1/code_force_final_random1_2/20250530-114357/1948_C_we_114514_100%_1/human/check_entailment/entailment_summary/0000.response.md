Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with two rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and moves according to specific rules.

Function func_1 takes three parameters: n (the number of columns), row1 (the first row of arrows), and row2 (the second row of arrows). It checks for specific conditions in the rows that would prevent the robot from reaching cell (2, n). If any of these conditions are met, it immediately returns 'No'. If none of the conditions are met after checking all positions, it returns 'Yes'.

Function func_2 reads input, processes each test case by calling func_1 with the provided parameters, and stores the results in a list. The function then prints the results as a newline-separated string.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that func_1 correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach cell (2, n) based on the given conditions. func_2 correctly reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
