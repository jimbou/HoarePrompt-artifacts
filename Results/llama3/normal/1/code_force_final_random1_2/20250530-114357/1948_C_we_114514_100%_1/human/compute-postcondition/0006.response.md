Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, results is a list containing at least four elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), stdin is empty, _ is 2**

The code block executes as follows: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin is empty, this line will not execute and `n` will not be updated. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `row1`. Again, since stdin is empty, this line will not execute and `row1` will not be updated. The third line assigns the string value of the input to `row2`. As stdin is empty, this line will also not execute and `row2` will not be updated. The fourth line appends the return value of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to the `results` list. Since `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not updated, the return value of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` will be the same as before, and the `results` list will contain at least four elements. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
