Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by moving down from the first row and then moving right along the arrow in the second row. The program only checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by moving right along the arrow in the first row and then moving down, but it does not consider the case when the robot moves down first and then moves right.

For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
>>><

The program will output "No", but the robot can actually reach the cell (2, 4) by moving down from the first row and then moving right along the arrow in the second row.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
