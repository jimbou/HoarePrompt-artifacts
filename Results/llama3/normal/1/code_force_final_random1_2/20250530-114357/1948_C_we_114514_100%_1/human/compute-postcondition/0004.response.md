Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, results is a list containing at least three elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), stdin is empty, _ is 1**

The code block executes three lines of code. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer, its type remains the same, but its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters to `row1`. The third line assigns another string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters to `row2`. The fourth line appends the return value of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to the `results` list, which now contains at least three elements. The `stdin` remains empty, and the value of `_` remains 1. The value of `t` is not affected by the code and remains a positive integer greater than 1.
