The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an even positive integer, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains one less input than initially. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an even positive integer, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains one less input than initially, `_` is 0**
