Postcondition: **n is a positive even integer, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, half_n is an integer equal to n divided by 2 and must be at least 3, i is half_n - 1. The current value of row1[n - 1] is '<' and the current value of row2[n - 2] is '<'. If row1[2 * i + 1] is '<' and either row2[2 * i] or row2[2 * i + 2] is '<', the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
