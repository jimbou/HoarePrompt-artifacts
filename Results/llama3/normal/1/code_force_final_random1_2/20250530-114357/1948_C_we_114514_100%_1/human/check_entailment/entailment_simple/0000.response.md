Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and moves according to certain rules.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of columns `n` and the two rows of the grid as input and returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) and 'No' otherwise. `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the rules of the robot's movement and checks all possible paths to the cell (2, n). It also handles the case where the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) by returning 'No'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the `func_1` function, the loop only checks up to `half_n - 1`, but it should check up to `half_n` to cover all possible paths. This means that the program may return 'Yes' even if the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) in some cases.

Correctness: **False**
