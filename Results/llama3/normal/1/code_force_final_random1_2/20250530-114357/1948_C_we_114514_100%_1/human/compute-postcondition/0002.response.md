Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, results is a list containing one element which is the return value of func_1(n, row1, row2), stdin is empty, _ is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was an even positive integer, it is now an integer. The second line assigns a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters to `row1`. The third line assigns a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters to `row2`. The fourth line appends the return value of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to `results`. Since `stdin` initially contained one less input than initially, it is now empty. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged.
