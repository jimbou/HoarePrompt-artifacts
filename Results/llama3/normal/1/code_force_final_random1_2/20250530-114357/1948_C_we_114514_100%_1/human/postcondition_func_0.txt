Determines whether a robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) based on the given conditions of two rows of '<' and '>' characters. The function takes three parameters: a positive even integer n, and two strings row1 and row2 of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It returns 'Yes' if the robot can move, and 'No' otherwise. The function checks for specific conditions in the rows, and if any of these conditions are met, it immediately returns 'No'. If none of the conditions are met after checking all positions, it returns 'Yes'.
