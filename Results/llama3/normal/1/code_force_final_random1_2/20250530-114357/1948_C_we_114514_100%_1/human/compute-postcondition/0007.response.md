Output State: **t is a positive integer equal to 0, n is an integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, results is a list containing t elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), stdin is empty, _ is t-1**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be equal to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variables n, row1, and row2 will still be integers and strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, respectively, but their values will be the last values they were assigned during the loop's execution. The results list will contain t elements, which are the return values of the func_1 function called during each iteration of the loop. The stdin will be empty, indicating that all inputs have been consumed. The variable _ will be equal to t-1, which is the last value it was assigned during the loop's execution.
