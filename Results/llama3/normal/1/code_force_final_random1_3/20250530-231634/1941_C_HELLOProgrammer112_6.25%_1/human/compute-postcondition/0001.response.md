The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases, `a` becomes `t`. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`. The third line assigns the count of the substring `'map'` in `s` to `x`. The fourth line assigns the count of the substring `'pie'` in `s` to `y`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **a is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), s is a string, x is the count of 'map' in s, y is the count of 'pie' in s, _ is 0, t is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
