Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string s and prints their sum. This is in line with the problem description, which requires the minimum number of characters to be deleted to make the string beautiful. Since 'map' and 'pie' are the only substrings that make a string ugly, deleting all occurrences of these substrings will make the string beautiful. Therefore, the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

Correctness: **True**
