Output State: **a is an integer equal to the first input, s is a string equal to the second input, x is the count of 'map' in s, y is the count of 'pie' in s, _ is t-1, t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the sum of the count of 'map' and 'pie' in s which is x + y is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 'a' will hold the value of the first input, 's' will hold the value of the second input, 'x' will hold the count of 'map' in 's', 'y' will hold the count of 'pie' in 's', the loop counter '_' will be one less than the initial value of 't', 't' will be greater than or equal to 0 (since it could be 0 if there were no test cases), there will be no more test cases left in stdin, and the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in 's' will be printed.
