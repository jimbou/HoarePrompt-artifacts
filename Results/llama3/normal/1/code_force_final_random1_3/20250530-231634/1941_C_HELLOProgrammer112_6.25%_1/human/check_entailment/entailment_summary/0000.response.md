Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string s and prints their sum, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. The program processes all test cases and prints the sum of 'map' and 'pie' counts for each case, as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
