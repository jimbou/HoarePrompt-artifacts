Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string s and prints their sum, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. The program assumes that the input is valid as described in the problem description, which means that the input string s consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of the string s is between 1 and 10^6.

The program uses the count() method of the string class in Python, which returns the number of occurrences of the substring in the string. This method is case-sensitive and only counts exact matches, which is what the problem requires.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input string s is already beautiful, in which case the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie" will be 0, and the program will print 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
