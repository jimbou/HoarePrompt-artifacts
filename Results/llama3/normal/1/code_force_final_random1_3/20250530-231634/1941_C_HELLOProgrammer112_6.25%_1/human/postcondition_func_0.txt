This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string s and prints their sum. The function processes all test cases and prints the sum of 'map' and 'pie' counts for each case.
