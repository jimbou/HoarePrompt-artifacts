Output State: **a is an integer equal to the first input, s is a string equal to the second input, x is the count of 'map' in s, y is the count of 'pie' in s, _ is 2, t is greater than 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` have been updated based on the input values. The value of `a` is now an integer equal to the first input, and the value of `s` is a string equal to the second input. The values of `x` and `y` are the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, respectively. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2, and the value of `t` is still greater than 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 2, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
