Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle cases where the substrings "map" and "pie" overlap. For example, in the string "mapie", the program will count this as two separate occurrences of "map" and "pie", when in fact it should only count as one. This is because the problem statement asks for the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, and in this case, deleting the "p" would make the string beautiful.

A correct solution would need to take into account the overlapping cases and only count each occurrence of "map" or "pie" once.
