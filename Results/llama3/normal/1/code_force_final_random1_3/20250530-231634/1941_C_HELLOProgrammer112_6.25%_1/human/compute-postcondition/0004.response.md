The only variables in the loop head are variable _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **a is an integer t (2 <= t <= 10^4), s is a string, x is the count of 'map' in s, y is the count of 'pie' in s, _ is 1, t is greater than 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in s which is x + y is being printed**
