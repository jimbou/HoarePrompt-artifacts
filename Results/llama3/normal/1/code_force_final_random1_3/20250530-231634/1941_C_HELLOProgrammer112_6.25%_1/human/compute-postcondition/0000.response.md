To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is an integer `t` in the input that is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, _ is 0, t is greater than 0**
