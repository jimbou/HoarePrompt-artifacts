Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `i` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `j` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` values where if the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', the `i`th and `j`th values are a value less than or equal to `n` and the rest are 0. Otherwise, `b` remains a list of `n+1` zeros except for the `i`th and `j`th values which are a value less than or equal to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and `n` strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `i` is 1, stdin contains `-n+1` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is `n`, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n`, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `i` (inclusive) and some values from `i+1` to `n`, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and the current values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains between 2 and 24. The lists `a` and `b` retain their original properties. The list `xx` still contains an empty string and `n` strings `x`. The string `x` still has a length of `n` and only contains characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.'. The value of `i` is still 1. The stdin still contains `-n+1` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.'. The value of `j` is still `n`. The list `sa` contains all values from 1 to `n`. The list `sb` now contains the value `i` (which is 1) in addition to some values from `i+1` to `n`. The length of `sa` is still less than the length of `sb`. The current values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are still both 0.
