Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `j` is 2, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `n` is at least 1. If the character at index j-1 of xx[i] is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx followed by 'S'. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then `nx` is a string containing 'S' followed by 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' followed by 'S'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `nx` has been appended with the character 'S'. The value of `nx` depends on the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx`, and the positions of `i` and `j` in the lists `sb`.
