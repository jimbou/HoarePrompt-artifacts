Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 2, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 2, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 2, and all other values are 0 if the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, and all other values are 0. b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are 1 and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros. xx is a list containing an empty string and the string x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 2, stdin contains -1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is 2.**

The code increments the values at indices i and j in list a by 1. Given the initial state, the value at index 1 in list a is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, and the values at indices i and j are the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', and 0 otherwise. After the code executes, the value at index 1 becomes the number of 'F' characters in x plus 2, and the values at indices i and j become the number of 'F' characters in x plus 2 if the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', and the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1 otherwise. The rest of the values in list a remain 0. The values in list b and the other variables remain unchanged.
