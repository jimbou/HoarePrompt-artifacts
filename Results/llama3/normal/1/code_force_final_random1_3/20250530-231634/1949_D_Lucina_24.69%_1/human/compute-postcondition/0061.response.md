Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 2 or 3 depending on whether the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 2, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 2 or 3 depending on whether the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 2, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 or 2, otherwise, the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop or the number of iterations of the loop plus 1, and the rest are 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, the string x, and the string x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 3, stdin contains -2 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is 3**
