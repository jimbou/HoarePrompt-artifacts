Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is n+1, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `n` is at least 1. `nx` is a string of length n containing either the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx if it is not '?', or either the character 'S' or 'F' if it is '?'. If `i` or `j` are in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is a string of length n containing 'S' or 'F' or a combination of 'S' and 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string of length n containing 'F' or a combination of 'F' and 'S'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 3 and 24. After each iteration, the value of `j` will increase by 1, and the string `nx` will be appended with either the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` if it is not '?', or either the character 'S' or 'F' if it is '?'. If `i` or `j` are in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` will be a string of length `n` containing 'S' or 'F' or a combination of 'S' and 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` will be a string of length `n` containing 'F' or a combination of 'F' and 'S'. The values of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body will remain unchanged.
