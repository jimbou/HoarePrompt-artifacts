The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop. `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop. `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string x, and the string x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `i` is 3, stdin contains -1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is n.**
