Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to create a transition video plan for a video game with n scenarios. The program takes n+1 inputs, where the first input is an integer n, and the next n inputs are strings of length n containing characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.'. The program then processes the input and prints n strings, each of length n, where each character is either 'F' or 'S'.

The program first initializes two lists, a and b, to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' characters in the input strings. It then creates two lists, sa and sb, to store the indices of the input strings that contain only 'F' or only 'S' characters, respectively.

The program then checks if the length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb. If true, it appends the indices of the input strings that contain neither 'F' nor 'S' characters to sa. It then iterates over the input strings and replaces the '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the values in sa.

If the length of sa is less than the length of sb, the program appends the indices of the input strings that contain neither 'F' nor 'S' characters to sb. It then iterates over the input strings and replaces the '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the values in sb.

The program finally prints the modified input strings.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues with the program:

1. The program uses 1-based indexing for the input strings, which can be confusing. It would be better to use 0-based indexing.
2. The program uses a lot of global variables, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It would be better to encapsulate the variables and functions within a class or a namespace.
3. The program does not handle invalid inputs. For example, if the input strings contain characters other than 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', the program will produce incorrect results. It would be better to add input validation to handle such cases.

Overall, the program is correct, but it can be improved with some minor modifications.

Correctness: **True**
