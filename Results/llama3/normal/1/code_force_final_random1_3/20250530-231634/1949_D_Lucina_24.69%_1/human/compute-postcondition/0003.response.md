To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already an integer between 2 and 24, it already satisfies this condition. However, we need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure it starts from 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `i` is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `j` is 1**
