Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, xx is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is n+1, stdin contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is n. If a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, then sa is a list containing the values from 1 to n. Otherwise, sa is a list containing some values from 1 to n. If b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, then sb is a list containing the values from 1 to n. Otherwise, sb is a list containing some values from 1 to n. The length of sa is less than the length of sb. If a[i] and b[i] are both 0, then sa is a list containing the values from 1 to n, and sb is a list containing the values from 1 to i (inclusive) and some values from i+1 to n. sb now contains the value i which is n+1. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sb contains the value i which is n+1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `j` is n, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `n` is at least 1. `nx` is a string containing the characters at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx for all j from 1 to n. If the character at index j-1 of xx[i] is '?', then the character at index j-1 of nx is either 'S' or 'F'. If `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then the character at index j-1 of nx is 'S'. Otherwise, the character at index j-1 of nx is 'F', and nx is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is n+1, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `n` is at least 1. `nx` is a string of length n. If the character at index j-1 of xx[i] is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index j - 1 of the string at index i in `xx` followed by the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx`. If the character at index j-1 of xx[i] is '?', then `nx` is a string containing either the character 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or the character 'F' otherwise, followed by the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx`. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is a string of length n ending with 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string of length n containing either 'SF' or 'FF'. `nx` has been appended with the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx`. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is a string of length n ending with 'SS'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string of length n containing either 'SFS', 'FFS', 'SFF' or 'FFF'. If `i` or `j` is not in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is a string of length n ending with 'SF'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string of length n containing either 'SFF' or 'FFF'. and nx is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is n+1, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `n` is at least 1. `nx` is a string of length n containing either the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx if it is not '?', or either the character 'S' or 'F' if it is '?'. If `i` or `j` are in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is a string of length n containing 'S' or 'F' or a combination of 'S' and 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string of length n containing 'F' or a combination of 'F' and 'S', and nx is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
