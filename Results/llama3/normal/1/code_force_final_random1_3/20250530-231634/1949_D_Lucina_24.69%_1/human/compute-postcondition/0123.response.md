Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is n, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n if a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to n, and if a[i] equals 0 and b[i] equals 0, then the value i is appended to the end of `sa`, and if a[i] equals 0 and b[i] equals 0, then the values 2 to n are appended to `sa`, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n if b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to n, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `nx` is a string of length n, where each character is either the character at the corresponding index in the string at index i in `xx`, or 'F' if `i` or the index is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or 'S' otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains at least 2, `i` remains 1, `a` and `b` remain lists of n+1 integers and values respectively, `xx` remains a list of strings, `x` remains a string of length n, `j` is now equal to n, `stdin` remains unchanged, `sa` and `sb` remain lists of values from 1 to n, and `nx` is a string of length n where each character is either the character at the corresponding index in the string at index i in `xx`, or 'F' if `i` or the index is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or 'S' otherwise.
