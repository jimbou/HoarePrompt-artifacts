To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already an integer between 2 and 24, we can conclude that `n` is indeed at least 1. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `i` to be 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `stdin` contains n inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `i` is 1**
