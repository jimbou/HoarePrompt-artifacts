Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of undecided transition videos is less than n // 4. In this case, the program will not correctly assign the remaining undecided transition videos to either 'F' or 'S' to satisfy the condition that no more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively.

For example, consider the input:

6
.?F???
?.???
F?.S??
??S.??
??.???
?????.

In this case, the program will not correctly assign the remaining undecided transition videos, and the output will not satisfy the condition.

The program should be modified to correctly handle this case, for example, by assigning the remaining undecided transition videos to 'F' or 'S' in a way that satisfies the condition.
