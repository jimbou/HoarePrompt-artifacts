Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop. `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop. `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string x, and the string x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `i` is 3, stdin contains -2 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is n.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1, otherwise, the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and the rest are 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, the string x, and the string x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 3, stdin contains -2 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 or 2 depending on whether the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 or 2 depending on whether the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 or 2, otherwise, the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop or the number of iterations of the loop plus 1, and the rest are 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, the string x, and the string x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 3, stdin contains -2 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 or 2 or 3 depending on whether the character at index j-1 of x is 'F' or 'S', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 or 2, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 or 2 or 3 depending on whether the character at index j-1 of x is 'F' or 'S', otherwise it is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 or 2, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1 or 2, otherwise, the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop or the number of iterations of the loop plus 1, and the rest are 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, the string x, and the string x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 3, stdin contains -2 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
