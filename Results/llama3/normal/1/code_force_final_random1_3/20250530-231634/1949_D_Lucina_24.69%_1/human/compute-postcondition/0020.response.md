Postcondition: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 and j is 3 or 4 if the jth character of x is 'F' and the condition x[j - 1] == 'F' is true, otherwise the value at index 1 and j is 2 if the jth character of x is 'F' and the condition x[j - 1] != 'F' is true, otherwise the value at index 1 is 1 or 2, the value at index j is 1 or 2 if the jth character of x is 'F', and all other values are 0, b is a list of n+1 zeros or values where the ith and jth values are 1 and the rest are 0 if the jth character of x is 'S', otherwise b remains a list of n+1 zeros if the jth character of x is not 'F' or 'S', or b is a list of n+1 values where the ith and jth values are 2 and the rest are 0 or 1 if the (j-1)th character of x is 'S'. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 values where the ith and jth values are 1 and the rest are 0 or 1. xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 1, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is 3.**
