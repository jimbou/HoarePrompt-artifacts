Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `i` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `j` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` values where if the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', the `i`th and `j`th values are a value less than or equal to `n` and the rest are 0. Otherwise, `b` remains a list of `n+1` zeros except for the `i`th and `j`th values which are a value less than or equal to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and `n` strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `i` is 2, stdin contains `-n+1` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is `n`. If `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n`. Otherwise, `sa` is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`. If `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, then `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n`. Otherwise, `sb` is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, then `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n`, and `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `i` (inclusive) and some values from `i+1` to `n`. `sb` now contains the value `i` which is 2. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sb` contains the value `i` which is 2.***
