Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 zeros, xx is a list containing an empty string, stdin contains n inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.'.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 2 and 24. The second and third lines initialize `a` and `b` as lists of `n+1` zeros. The fourth line initializes `xx` as a list containing an empty string. The remaining inputs in stdin are `n` strings of length `n`, each containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.'.
