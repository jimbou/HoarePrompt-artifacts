State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus 1, the value at index `j` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus 1 if the `jth` character of `x` is 'F', and all other values are 0. `b` is a list of `n+1` zeros or values where the `ith` and `jth` values are the number of 'S' characters in `x` plus 1 and the rest are 0 if the `jth` character of `x` is 'S'. Otherwise, `b` remains a list of `n+1` zeros if the `jth` character of `x` is not 'F' or 'S'. `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `i` is 2, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is `n`**
