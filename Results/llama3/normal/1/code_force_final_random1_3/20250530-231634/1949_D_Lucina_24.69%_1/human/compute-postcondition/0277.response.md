Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It takes n+1 inputs, where n is an integer between 2 and 24, and the next n inputs are strings of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.'. The function then creates two lists, sa and sb, based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters in the input strings. Depending on the lengths of sa and sb, it either appends values to sa or sb. Finally, it prints n strings, each of length n, where each character is either 'F' or 'S', determined by the values in sa or sb.**
