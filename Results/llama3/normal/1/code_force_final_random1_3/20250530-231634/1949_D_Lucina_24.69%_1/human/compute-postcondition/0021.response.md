Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1 if the jth character of x is 'F', and all other values are 0. b is a list of n+1 zeros or values where the ith and jth values are the number of 'S' characters in x plus 1 and the rest are 0 if the jth character of x is 'S'. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros if the jth character of x is not 'F' or 'S'. xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is n.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have values at index 1 and `j` equal to the number of 'F' characters in the string `x` plus 1, if the `j`th character of `x` is 'F'. The list `b` will have values at index `i` and `j` equal to the number of 'S' characters in the string `x` plus 1, if the `j`th character of `x` is 'S'. The other variables remain unchanged.
