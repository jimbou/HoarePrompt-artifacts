Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 zeros or values where the ith and jth values are 1 and the rest are 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', j is 1, and the j-1th character of x is not 'F'. If the j-1th character of x is 'S', then the jth and ith values of b are 1 and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros.***
