Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `i` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `j` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to `n`, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index `j`-1 of `x` is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to `n` and the rest are 0. Otherwise, `b` remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is 2, `stdin` contains -`n`+1 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`, and if `a[i]` equals 0 and `b[i]` equals 0, then the value `i` is appended to the end of `sa`, and if `a[i]` equals 0 and `b[i]` equals 0, then the values 2 to `n` are appended to `sa`, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `nx` is either a string containing the character at index `j`-1 of `x` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or a string containing one 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or a string 'S' if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and `nx` is appended with the character at index `j`-1 of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `nx` has been updated by appending the character at index `j`-1 of `x`. The value of `nx` is now either the character at index `j`-1 of `x` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or 'S' if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', followed by the character at index `j`-1 of `x`.
