To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is in the range from 2 to `n`, and `n` is an integer between 3 and 24.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j + 1`. Since `j` is in the range from 2 to `n`, the new value of `j` will be in the range from 3 to `n + 1`.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `j` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`
* `n` is an integer between 3 and 24

All other variables, such as `i`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `x`, `stdin`, `sa`, `sb`, and `nx`, are not modified in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is in the range from 3 to n + 1, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `n` is at least 1. `nx` is a string of length 2 containing either the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx if it is not '?', or either the character 'S' or 'F' if it is '?'. If `i` or `j` are in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is 'S' or 'SS' or 'SF'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' or 'FS' or 'FF'.**
