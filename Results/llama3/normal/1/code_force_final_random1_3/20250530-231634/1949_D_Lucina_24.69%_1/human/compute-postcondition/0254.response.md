Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is in the range from 1 to n, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `n` is at least 1. `nx` is an empty string. The character at index j-1 of xx[i] is '?'. The current value of `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or the current value of `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`***
