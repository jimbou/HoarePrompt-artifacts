The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1 if the jth character of x is 'F', and all other values are 0. If the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, and the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 2. b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are 1 and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros. xx is a list containing an empty string and the string x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 2, stdin contains -1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is 2.**
