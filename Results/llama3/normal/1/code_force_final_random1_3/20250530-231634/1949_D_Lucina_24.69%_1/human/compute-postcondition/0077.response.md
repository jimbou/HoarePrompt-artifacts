Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `i` is 2, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is n, `sa` is a list containing the value 1 and the value i, if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, otherwise `sa` is a list containing the value 1, `sb` is a list containing the value 1, if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, otherwise `sb` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `sa` now contains the value `i` in addition to the value 1, if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. The value of `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
