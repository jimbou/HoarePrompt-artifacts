Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `n`+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `i` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `j` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to `n`, `b` is a list of `n`+1 values where if the character at index `j`-1 of `x` is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to `n` and the rest are 0. Otherwise, `b` remains a list of `n`+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and `n` strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is 3, `stdin` contains -`n`+1 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`, and if `a[i]` equals 0 and `b[i]` equals 0, then the value `i` is appended to the end of `sa`, and if `a[i]` equals 0 and `b[i]` equals 0, then the values 2 to `n` are appended to `sa`, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If the character at index `j`-1 of `x` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index `j`-1 of `x` plus the character at index `j`-1 of the string at index `i` of `xx`. If the character at index `j`-1 of `x` is '?', then `nx` is a string containing either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n`/4 elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F' or 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S' or 'S' is appended to `nx`. `nx` is a string containing either 'F' or 'S' plus 'F'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `nx` has been updated to include an additional 'F' character. All other variables remain unchanged.
