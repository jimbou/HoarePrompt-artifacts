Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `j` is 3, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n, `n` is at least 1. If the character at index j-1 of xx[i] is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx plus the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx plus 'S'. If `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then `nx` is a string containing 'S' plus the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx plus 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' plus the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx plus 'S'. If the character at index j-1 of xx[i] is '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx followed by either 'S' or 'F' plus 'S'. If `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then `nx` is a string containing 'S' followed by either 'S' or 'F' plus 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' followed by either 'S' or 'F' plus 'S'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `nx` depends on the previous value of `nx` and the values of `i`, `j`, and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character is not '?', `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to 'S' plus the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. Otherwise, `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to 'F' plus the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character is '?', `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` followed by either 'S' or 'F'.
