Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of x is 'F', the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of x is 'F' or 'S', the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of x is 'F' or 'S', and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', otherwise, the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and the rest are 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, the string x, and the string x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 3, stdin contains -2 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is n.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have values at indices 1, `i`, and `j` that are the sum of the number of 'F' characters in string `x`, the number of iterations of the loop, and the number of times the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'F' or 'S'. The list `b` will have values at indices `i` and `j` that are the sum of the number of iterations of the loop and the number of times the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S'. All other values in `a` and `b` will be 0 or less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop. The other variables `xx`, `x`, `i`, `stdin`, and `j` remain unchanged.
