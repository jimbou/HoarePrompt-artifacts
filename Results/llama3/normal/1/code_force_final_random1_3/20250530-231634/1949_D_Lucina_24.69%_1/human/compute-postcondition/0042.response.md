Postcondition: **n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, 2, or 3, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, 2, or 3, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus 1, 2, or 3, and all other values are 0 or 1. b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are 1 or 2 and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are 1 or 2. xx is a list containing an empty string and the string x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is 2, stdin contains -1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is 3.**
