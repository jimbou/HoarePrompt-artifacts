Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `i` is n+1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `j` is n, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n if a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to n, and if a[i] equals 0 and b[i] equals 0, then the value i is appended to the end of `sa`, and if a[i] equals 0 and b[i] equals 0, then the values 2 to n are appended to `sa`, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n if b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to n, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, `b` is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, `x` is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is n, `stdin` contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to n if a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to n, and if a[i] equals 0 and b[i] equals 0, then the value i is appended to the end of `sa`, and if a[i] equals 0 and b[i] equals 0, then the values 2 to n are appended to `sa`, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to n if b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to n, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `nx` is a string of length n, where each character is either the character at the corresponding index in the string at index i in `xx`, or 'F' if `i` or the index is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or 'S' otherwise, and `nx` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least `n`, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `n`+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `i` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `j` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to `n`, `b` is a list of `n`+1 values where if the character at index `j`-1 of `x` is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to `n` and the rest are 0. Otherwise, `b` remains a list of `n`+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and `n` strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is `n`, `stdin` contains -`n`+1 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`, and if `a[i]` equals 0 and `b[i]` equals 0, then the value `i` is appended to the end of `sa`, and if `a[i]` equals 0 and `b[i]` equals 0, then the values 2 to `n` are appended to `sa`, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `nx` is either a string containing the character at index `j`-1 of `x` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or a string containing one 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or a string 'S' if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and `nx` has been appended with either the character at index `j`-1 of `x` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or either 'F' or 'S' depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', for all `j` from 1 to `n`. The value of `nx` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `n`+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `i` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, the value at index `j` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus `n`, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to `n`, `b` is a list of `n`+1 values where if the character at index `j`-1 of `x` is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to `n` and the rest are 0. Otherwise, `b` remains a list of `n`+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and `n` strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `j` is `n`, `stdin` contains -`n`+1 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`, and if `a[i]` equals 0 and `b[i]` equals 0, then the value `i` is appended to the end of `sa`, and if `a[i]` equals 0 and `b[i]` equals 0, then the values 2 to `n` are appended to `sa`, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, otherwise it is a list containing some values from 1 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `nx` is a string of length `n` containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.'. If the character at index `j`-1 of `x` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index `j`-1 of `x` plus the character at index `j`-1 of the string at index `i` of `xx`. If the character at index `j`-1 of `x` is '?', then `nx` is a string containing either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n`/4 elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F' or 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S' or 'S' is appended to `nx`. If the character at index `j`-1 of the string at index `i` of `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is appended with the character at index `j`-1 of the string at index `i` of `xx`. Otherwise, `nx` is either a string containing either 'F' or 'S' plus 'F' or a string containing 'S' appended to its previous value, and `nx` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
