Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'F', the value at index `i` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'F' or 'S', the value at index `j` is the number of 'F' characters in `x` plus the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'F' or 'S', and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `b` is a list of `n+1` values where if the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', the `i`th and `j`th values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', otherwise, the `i`th and `j`th values are a value less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and the rest are 0, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, the string `x`, and the string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', `i` is 3, `j` is `n`, stdin contains -2 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `xx` now contains four strings: an empty string, the string `x`, the string `x`, and the string `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
