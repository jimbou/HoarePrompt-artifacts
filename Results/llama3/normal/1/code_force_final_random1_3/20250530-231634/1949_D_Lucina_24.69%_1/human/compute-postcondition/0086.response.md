Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index i is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, the value at index j is the number of 'F' characters in x plus n, and all other values are 0 or a value less than or equal to n, b is a list of n+1 values where if the character at index j-1 of x is 'S', the ith and jth values are a value less than or equal to n and the rest are 0. Otherwise, b remains a list of n+1 zeros except for the ith and jth values which are a value less than or equal to n, xx is a list containing an empty string, and n strings x, x is a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.', i is n+1, stdin contains -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string contains only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.', j is n. If a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, then sa is a list containing the values from 1 to n. Otherwise, sa is a list containing some values from 1 to n. If b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, then sb is a list containing the values from 1 to n. Otherwise, sb is a list containing some values from 1 to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), and in each iteration, it checks the conditions for a[i] and b[i]. If a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, it appends the current value of i to the list sa. If b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, it appends the current value of i to the list sb.

After the loop finishes executing all the iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:

* n remains the same, an integer between 2 and 24.
* a and b remain the same, with their values depending on the number of 'F' characters in x and the presence of 'S' characters in x.
* xx and x remain the same, with xx containing an empty string and n strings x, and x being a string of length n containing only characters 'F', 'S', '?' and '.'.
* i is now n+1, indicating that the loop has finished executing all the iterations.
* stdin remains the same, containing -n+1 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only characters 'F', 'S',?' and '.'.
* j remains the same, equal to n.
* sa and sb are lists containing some or all values from 1 to n, depending on the conditions checked in the loop. If a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sa contains all values from 1 to n. Otherwise, sa contains some values from 1 to n. If b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, sb contains all values from 1 to n. Otherwise, sb contains some values from 1 to n.
