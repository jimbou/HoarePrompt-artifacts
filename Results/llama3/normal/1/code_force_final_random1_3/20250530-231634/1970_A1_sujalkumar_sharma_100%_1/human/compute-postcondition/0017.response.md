Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, i, s[i]), (balance, i+1, s[i+1])), `i` is 3. If `s[i]` is '(', then `balance` is increased by 1 and `prefix_balance` is updated with `balance+1`. If `s[i]` is ')', then `balance` is decreased by 1 and `prefix_balance` is updated with `balance-1`.***
