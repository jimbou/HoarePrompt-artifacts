Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, s[0])), `balance` is 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The list `prefix_balance` now contains a single tuple, which includes the initial balance (0), the initial index (0), and the first character of the string `s` (s[0]). The balance and index `i` remain unchanged.
