Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, i, s[i]), (balance, i+1, s[i+1])), `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and a new tuple has been appended to the `prefix_balance` list. The new tuple contains the current balance, the updated index `i+1`, and the character at the updated index `s[i+1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
