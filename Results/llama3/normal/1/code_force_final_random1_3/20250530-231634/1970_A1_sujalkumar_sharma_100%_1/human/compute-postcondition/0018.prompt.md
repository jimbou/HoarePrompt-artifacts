Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, prefix_balance is an empty list, balance is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
    if s[i] == '(':
        balance += 1
    else:
        balance -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, s[0])), `i` is 0, and `balance` is either 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "(", or -1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is a close parenthesis ")"

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples ((0, 0, s[0]) and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, i, s[i]), (balance, i+1, s[i+1])), `i` is 3. If `s[i]` is '(', then `balance` is increased by 1 and `prefix_balance` is updated with `balance+1`. If `s[i]` is ')', then `balance` is decreased by 1 and `prefix_balance` is updated with `balance-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
