Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, s[0])), `balance` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is ")"**

The value of `balance` is decremented by 1, resulting in a new value of -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` is still a balanced parentheses sequence, and its length `n` is still greater than 0. The list `prefix_balance` still contains one tuple with the initial values. The index `i` is still 0, and the character at this index in string `s` is still ")".
