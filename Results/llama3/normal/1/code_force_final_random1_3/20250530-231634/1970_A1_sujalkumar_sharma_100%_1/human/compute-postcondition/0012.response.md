Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples ((0, 0, s[0]) and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -2.***
