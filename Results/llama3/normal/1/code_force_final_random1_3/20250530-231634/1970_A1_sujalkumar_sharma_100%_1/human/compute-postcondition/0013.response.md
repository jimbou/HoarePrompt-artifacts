To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `s`, `prefix_balance`, and `balance` does not need to be adjusted, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples ((0, 0, s[0]) and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 2**
