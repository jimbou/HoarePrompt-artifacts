Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance+1, i, s[i]), (balance+1, i+1, s[i+1])), `i` is 3, `balance` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been increased by 1, and the list `prefix_balance` has been updated to reflect this change. The other variables, `s`, `n`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
