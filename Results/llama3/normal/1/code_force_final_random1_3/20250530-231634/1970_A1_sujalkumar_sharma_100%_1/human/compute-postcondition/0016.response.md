Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance-1, i, s[i]), (balance-1, i+1, s[i+1])), `i` is 3, `balance` is `balance - 1`**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been decremented by 1, and the tuples in the `prefix_balance` list have been updated to reflect this change. The other variables, `s`, `n`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
