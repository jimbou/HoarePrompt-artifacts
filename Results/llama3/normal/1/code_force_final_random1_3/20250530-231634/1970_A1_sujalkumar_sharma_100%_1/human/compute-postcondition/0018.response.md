Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `prefix_balance` is a list containing `n` tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, i, s[i]), ..., (balance, n-1, s[n-1])), `i` is `n-1`, and `balance` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length `n` of the string remains unchanged, the list `prefix_balance` contains `n` tuples, each representing the balance and index of each character in the string, the index `i` is at the last character of the string, and the balance is 0, indicating that the parentheses sequence is balanced.
