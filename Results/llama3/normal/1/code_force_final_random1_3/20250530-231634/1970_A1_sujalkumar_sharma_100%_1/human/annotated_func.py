    #The program returns a string 'result' that consists of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the parentheses based on their balance and position, and returns a new string with the sorted parentheses, maintaining the balance of the original sequence.
