To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `s`, `prefix_balance`, and `balance`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, s[0])), `i` is 1, and `balance` is either 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "(", or -1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is a close parenthesis ")"**
