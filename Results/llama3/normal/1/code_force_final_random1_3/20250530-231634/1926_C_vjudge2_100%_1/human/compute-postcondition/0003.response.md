To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `num` since it's the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `num` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^4.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `num` is not equal to 0. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `num` to be a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^4, and also not equal to 0.

State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^4, and `num` is not equal to 0, `a` is equal to the original value of `a` plus the last digit of the original `num`**
