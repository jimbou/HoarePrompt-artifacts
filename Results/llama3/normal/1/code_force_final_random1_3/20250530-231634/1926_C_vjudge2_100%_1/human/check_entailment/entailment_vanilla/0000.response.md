Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The given program attempts to solve this problem by precomputing the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and storing them in an array A.

2. The program defines a function func_1 that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. This function works correctly by using a while loop to extract each digit from the number (using the modulus operator) and adding it to a running total.

3. The program then populates the array A by iterating over all numbers from 1 to 200,000, calculating the sum of their digits using func_1, and adding this sum to a running total. This running total is stored in the array A at the corresponding index.

4. After populating the array A, the program reads the number of test cases t and then reads each test case n. For each test case, it simply prints the value stored in the array A at index n-1.

5. The time complexity of the program is O(200,000) for populating the array A, and then O(t) for reading and processing the test cases. Since t can be up to 10^4, the overall time complexity is O(200,000 + 10^4), which is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

6. The space complexity of the program is O(200,000) for storing the array A.

7. The program correctly handles the given constraints, including the range of n (1 to 2*10^5) and the number of test cases t (1 to 10^4).

8. The program produces the correct output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
