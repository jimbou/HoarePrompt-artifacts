Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a pre-computation approach to store the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the corresponding sum from the array.

The function `func_1(num)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by repeatedly taking the last digit of the number (`num % 10`) and adding it to the sum, and then removing the last digit from the number (`num = int(num / 10)`).

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1 or 200,000. The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, which is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
