Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to calculate the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the precomputed sum for the given number n.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of precomputation allows the program to avoid redundant calculations and meet the tight time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

The execution summary also confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given positive integer.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
