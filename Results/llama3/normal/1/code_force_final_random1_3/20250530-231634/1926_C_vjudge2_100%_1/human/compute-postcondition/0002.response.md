Output State: **num is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^4, a is equal to the original value of a plus the last digit of the original num**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been reduced by removing its last digit, and the value of `a` has been increased by the value of the last digit of the original `num`. The original value of `num` was a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, so after removing the last digit, it is now a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^4. The original value of `a` was 0, so after adding the last digit of the original `num`, it is now equal to the last digit of the original `num`.
