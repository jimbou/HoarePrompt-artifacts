According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num. If num is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^3, and num is not equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time num must be greater than 0.
State: **num is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^3, and num is not equal to 0, a is equal to the original value of a plus the last digit of the original num and the last digit of the original num**
