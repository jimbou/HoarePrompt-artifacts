To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that `num` is not equal to 0. Since `num` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, we can conclude that `num` must be greater than 0.

State: **`num` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0**
