Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in an array A. This is done using the function func_1, which correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.

2. Then, for each test case, the program reads an integer n and prints the nth element of the array A, which is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n.

3. The function func_1 is correctly implemented. It calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by repeatedly taking the last digit of the number (using num % 10), adding it to the sum, and removing the last digit from the number (using int(num / 10)).

4. The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, because it simply reads an integer and prints a pre-calculated value. This is well within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

5. The space complexity of the program is O(1), because it uses a fixed amount of space to store the array A.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
