Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits.

Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to 200000 and stores these sums in an array A. This is done using the function func_1, which correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.

2. Then, for each test case, the program reads an integer n and prints the nth element of the array A, which is the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits.

3. The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, which is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
