Output State: _t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i is the number of times the loop executed, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 2, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable s has reached the value of k, the variable d has reached 0, and the variable i has reached the number of times the loop executed. The other variables remain unchanged.
