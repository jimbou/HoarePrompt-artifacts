Output State: **_ is t, s is either k or 0, i is either the smallest integer i such that s >= k or 0, d is either 0 or n, h is either 0 or n, p is either i or 1, g is either n or the sum of (n + 1) // 2^j for j from 1 to i - 1, f is k - g, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`. The values of `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `f` will depend on whether `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` or not. If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, then `s` will be equal to `k`, `i` will be the smallest integer `i` such that `s >= k`, `d` will be 0, `h` will be 0, `p` will be `i`, `g` will be the sum of `(n + 1) // 2^j` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`, and `f` will be `k - g`. If `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `s` will be 0, `i` will be 0, `d` will be `n`, `h` will be `n`, `p` will be 1, `g` will be 0, and `f` will be `k - n`. The value of `y` will be either `2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1)` or `2k - 1` depending on whether `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` or not.
