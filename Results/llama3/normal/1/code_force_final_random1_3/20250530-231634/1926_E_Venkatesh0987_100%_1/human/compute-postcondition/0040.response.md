Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i is the smallest integer i such that s >= k, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variables _t, n, k, s, i, d, f, and y remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable h is reduced to 0, p is equal to i, and g is equal to n. The variable _ remains 1.
