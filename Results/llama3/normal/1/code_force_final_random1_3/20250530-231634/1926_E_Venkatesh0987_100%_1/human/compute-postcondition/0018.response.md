The code prints the value of `y`, which is calculated as `2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1)`. Here, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.

Since the exact values of `i`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `y` based on the given formula.

Output: **2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) (where i is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer between 1 and n, and n is an integer between 1 and 10^9)**
