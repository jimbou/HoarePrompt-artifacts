Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - i inputs: t - i pairs of integers n and k.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, the variable `i` is greater than or equal to 1, and the variable `d` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
