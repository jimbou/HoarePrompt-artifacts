According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable p and i.  If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is less than or equal to i and i is greater than 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time p must be less than or equal to i - 1.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than 2, d is 0, h is (n+1)//4, p is less than or equal to i - 1, g is (3n+3)//4, _ is 0, stdin contains t - i inputs: t - i pairs of integers n and k.**
