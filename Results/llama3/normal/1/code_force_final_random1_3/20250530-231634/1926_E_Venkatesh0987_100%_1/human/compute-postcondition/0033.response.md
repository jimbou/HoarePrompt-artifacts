To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `p <= i - 1`. This means we are only concerned with the states of `p` and `i`.

Given the initial states:

- `_t` is an integer between 1 and 50000
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`
- `s` is `k`
- `i` is the smallest integer `i` such that `s >= k`
- `d` is 0
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `_` is 1
- `f` is `k - n`
- `y` is either `2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1)` or `2k - 1` depending on whether `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` or not

We need to adjust the states so that `p <= i - 1` is true for the first iteration.

Since `p` is 1, for `p <= i - 1` to be true, `i` must be at least 2. Given that `i` is defined as the smallest integer `i` such that `s >= k` and `s` is `k`, this implies that the condition is already satisfied if `i` is indeed 2 or more, which aligns with its definition since `s` equals `k`, suggesting `i` would be at least 1, but since we need `i` to be at least 2 for the loop to execute, we must ensure `i` is indeed greater than 1.

However, since `i` is defined based on `s` and `k`, and `s` is equal to `k`, the condition that `i` must be greater than 1 is inherently satisfied by its definition because for `s >= k` to hold true with `s` being `k`, `i` being the smallest integer fulfilling this condition would indeed be 1 or more, but since we need it to be more than 1 for the loop to execute, we acknowledge that `i`'s state needs to reflect a scenario where it is indeed more than 1.

Given `p` is fixed at 1, the adjustment needed is to ensure `i` is more than 1, which aligns with the necessity for the loop to execute. However, since `i` is dependent on `s` and `k`, and `s` equals `k`, the critical adjustment is conceptual, ensuring the scenario allows for `i` to be more than 1, which is feasible given `i` is defined as the smallest integer where `s >= k`, implying flexibility in `i`'s value based on `s` and `k`'s relationship.

Thus, the state adjustment focuses on ensuring `i` can indeed be more than 1, which is feasible within its defined constraints, especially considering `s` equals `k`, and `i` is the smallest integer fulfilling `s >= k`.

State: **`_t` is an integer between 1 and 50000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `s` is `k`, `i` must be more than 1 and is the smallest integer `i` such that `s >= k`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is 1, `f` is `k - n`, and `y` is either `2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1)` or `2k - 1` depending on whether `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` or not**
