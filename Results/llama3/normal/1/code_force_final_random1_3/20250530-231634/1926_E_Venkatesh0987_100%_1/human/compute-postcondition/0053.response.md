Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and n is greater than (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer between 1 and n and k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2), i is 2, d is n - (n + 1) // 2 - ((n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2), h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 2, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not**

In this output state, the values of `_t`, `n`, `k`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `_`, and `f` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `s` is incremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `((n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2)`. The value of `d` is decremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `((n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `y` remains the same as it is not modified by the code snippet.
