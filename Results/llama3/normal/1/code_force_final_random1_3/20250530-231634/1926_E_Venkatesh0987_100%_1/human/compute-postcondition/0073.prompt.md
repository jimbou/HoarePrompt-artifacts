Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 50000) and then t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    i = 0
    d = n
    h = n
    p = 1
    g = 0
    if k > (n + 1) // 2:
        while s < k and d > 0:
            s += (d + 1) // 2
            d -= (d + 1) // 2
            i += 1
        while p <= i - 1:
            g += (h + 1) // 2
            h -= (h + 1) // 2
            p += 1
        f = k - g
        y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
        print(y)
    else:
        print(2 * k - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, _ is 0, f is k - n, and y is 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) is being printed if k is greater than (n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and 2 times k minus 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is either k or 0, i is either the smallest integer i such that s >= k or 0, d is either 0 or n, h is either 0 or n, p is either i or 1, g is either n or 0, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then y is 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) and y is printed. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then y is 2k - 1 and the value of 2 * k - 1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then s is k, i is the number of iterations needed to reach s >= k, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is the sum of (n + 1) // 2^j for j from 1 to i - 1, _ is 2, f is k - g, and y is 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) and y is printed. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 2, f is k - n, and y is 2k - 1, which is equal to 2 times the value of k minus 1, where k is an integer between 1 and n and k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of 2 * k - 1 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
