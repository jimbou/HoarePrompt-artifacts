Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than 2, d is 0, h is (n+1)//4, p is less than or equal to i, g is (3n+3)//4, _ is 0, stdin contains t - i inputs: t - i pairs of integers n and k.**

The code block modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `(n+1)//4`. The second line decrements `h` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `(n+1)//4`, making `h` equal to `(n+1)//4`. The third line increments `p` by 1, making `p` less than or equal to `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
