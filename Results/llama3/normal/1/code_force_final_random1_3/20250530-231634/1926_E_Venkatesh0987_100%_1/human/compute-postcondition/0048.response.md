State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is either k or 0, i is either the smallest integer i such that s >= k or 0, d is either 0 or n, h is either 0 or n, p is either i or 1, g is either n or 0, _ is 2, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then y is 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) and y is printed. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then y is 2k - 1 and the value of 2 * k - 1 is being printed.**
