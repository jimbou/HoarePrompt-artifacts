Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first checks if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. This is because the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards laid down are the odd-numbered cards, and if `k` is within this range, the `k`-th card can be directly calculated as `2 * k - 1`.

2. If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program enters a loop where it calculates the number of cards laid down in each iteration. In each iteration, it calculates the number of cards that are `2^i` times an odd number, where `i` is the current iteration number. It keeps track of the total number of cards laid down so far (`g`) and the number of cards remaining (`d`).

3. Once the loop finishes, the program calculates the `k`-th card by multiplying `2` to the power of `i-1` (where `i` is the last iteration number) with `2 * f - 1`, where `f` is the position of the `k`-th card within the last iteration.

4. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1, as shown in the example input.

5. The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is equal to `n`, as shown in the example input.

6. The program's time complexity is O(log n) due to the loop that runs until `d` becomes 0, which happens at most log n times. This is efficient for the given constraints.

7. The program's space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.

Therefore, the given program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
