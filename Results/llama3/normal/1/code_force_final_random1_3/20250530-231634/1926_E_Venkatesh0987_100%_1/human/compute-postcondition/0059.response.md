Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i is greater than or equal to 2, d is 0, h is (n + 1) // 2, p is 2, g is (n + 1) // 2, _ is 2, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**

The code modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by half of `h` plus one, which is equivalent to `(h + 1) // 2`. The second line decrements `h` by the same amount, effectively setting it to `(n + 1) // 2`. The third line increments `p` by 1, making it 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
