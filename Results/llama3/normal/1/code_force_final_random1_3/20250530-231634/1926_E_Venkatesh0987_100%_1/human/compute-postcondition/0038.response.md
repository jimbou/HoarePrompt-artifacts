Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i must be more than 1 and is the smallest integer i such that s >= k, d is 0, h is (n + 1) // 4 - (n + 1) // 8, p is less than i and is equal to p + 1, g is (3n + 3) // 4 + (n + 1) // 8, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not**

The code modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `(n + 1) // 8`. The second line decrements `h` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `(n + 1) // 8`. The third line increments `p` by 1. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
