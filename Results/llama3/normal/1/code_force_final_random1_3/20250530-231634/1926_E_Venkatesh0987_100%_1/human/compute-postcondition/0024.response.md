State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) is being printed if k is greater than (n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and 2 times k minus 1 is printed.**
