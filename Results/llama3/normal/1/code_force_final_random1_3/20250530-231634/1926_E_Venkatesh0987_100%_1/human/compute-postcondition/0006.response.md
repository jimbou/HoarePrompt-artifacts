Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 2 and 10^9, k is an integer greater than (n + 1) // 2, s is (n + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2, i is 2, d is (n - 1) // 2 - (d + 1) // 2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: t - 2 pairs of integers n and k**

The code modifies the values of `s`, `d`, and `i`. The first line increments `s` by the value of `(d + 1) // 2`, which is half of `d` plus one, rounded down. The second line decrements `d` by the same value, effectively reducing it by half. The third line increments `i` by 1. The remaining variables and the state of stdin are unaffected.
