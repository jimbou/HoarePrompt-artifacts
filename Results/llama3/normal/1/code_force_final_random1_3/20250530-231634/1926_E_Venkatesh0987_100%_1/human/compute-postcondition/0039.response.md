Output State: _t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i is the smallest integer i such that s >= k, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* _t remains an integer between 1 and 50000.
* n remains an integer between 1 and 10^9.
* k remains an integer between 1 and n.
* s remains equal to k.
* i remains the smallest integer i such that s >= k.
* d remains 0.
* h becomes 0 after the loop executes all the iterations.
* p becomes equal to i after the loop executes all the iterations.
* g becomes equal to n after the loop executes all the iterations.
* _ remains 1.
* f remains equal to k - n.
* y remains either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.

Note that the loop will execute until p is no longer less than or equal to i - 1, which means p will become equal to i after the loop executes all the iterations. The value of h will become 0 after the loop executes all the iterations, and the value of g will become equal to n after the loop executes all the iterations.
