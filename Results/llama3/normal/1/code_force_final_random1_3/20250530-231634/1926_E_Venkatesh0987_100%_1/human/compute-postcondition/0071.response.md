Output: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 2, f is k - n, and y is 2k - 1. Additionally, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of 2 * k - 1 is being printed, which is equal to 2 times the value of k minus 1, where k is an integer between 1 and n and k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2.**
