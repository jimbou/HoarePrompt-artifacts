Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**

The code snippet assigns new values to the variables n, k, s, i, d, h, p, and g. The initial values of these variables are overwritten by the new values. The variable _t remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable f is not directly modified by the code, but its value depends on the values of k and n, which are updated by the code. The variable y is not directly modified by the code, but its value depends on the values of k, n, and i, which are updated by the code. The value of y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.
