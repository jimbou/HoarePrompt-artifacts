According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is less than or equal to `i`, and `i` must be more than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than `i`, so `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i must be more than 1 and is the smallest integer i such that s >= k, d is 0, h is (n + 1) // 4, p is less than i, g is (3n + 3) // 4, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not**
