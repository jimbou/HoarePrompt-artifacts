Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, _ is 0, stdin contains t - i inputs: t - i pairs of integers n and k.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'h' becomes 0, 'p' becomes equal to 'i', and 'g' becomes equal to 'n'. The other variables remain unchanged.
