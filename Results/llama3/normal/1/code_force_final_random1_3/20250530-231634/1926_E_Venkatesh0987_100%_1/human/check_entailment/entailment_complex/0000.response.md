Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th card laid down by Vladislav in a specific process. The program iterates through the input pairs (n, k) and calculates the value of the k-th card based on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2.

The program uses a series of iterations and bit manipulations to calculate the value when k is greater than (n + 1) // 2. It correctly calculates the number of cards laid down in each iteration and keeps track of the remaining cards. The final calculation of the k-th card value using the formula 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1) is also correct.

When k is not greater than (n + 1) // 2, the program simply prints 2 * k - 1, which is the correct value for the k-th card in this case.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is 1 or when n is 1. The use of the variable g to keep track of the sum of (n + 1) // 2^j for j from 1 to i - 1 is also correct.

Overall, the program is well-structured, and the logic is correct. It correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for the given input pairs.

Correctness: **True**
