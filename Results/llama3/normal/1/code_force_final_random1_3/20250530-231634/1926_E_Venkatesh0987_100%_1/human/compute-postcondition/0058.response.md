To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `p` and `i`.

According to the loop condition, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1` for the loop to execute. Since `p` is initially 1, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure that `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i is greater than or equal to 2, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 2, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**
