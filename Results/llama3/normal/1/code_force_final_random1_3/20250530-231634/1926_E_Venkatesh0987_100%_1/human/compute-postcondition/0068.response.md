Output: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i is the number of iterations needed to reach s >= k, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is the sum of (n + 1) // 2^j for j from 1 to i - 1, _ is 2, f is k - g, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not, and y is printed**
