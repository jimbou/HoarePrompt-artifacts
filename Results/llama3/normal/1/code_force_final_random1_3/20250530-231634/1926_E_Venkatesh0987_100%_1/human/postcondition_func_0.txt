This function reads a series of input pairs (n, k) from standard input, where n and k are integers, and for each pair, it calculates and prints a value based on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2. If k is greater, it calculates the value using a series of iterations and bit manipulations, otherwise, it simply prints 2 * k - 1. The function processes multiple input pairs as specified by an initial integer t, which indicates the number of pairs to follow.
