Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than ((n + 1) // 2) and less than or equal to n, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n - 1) // 2) // 2, i is 2, d is (n - 1) // 2 - ((n - 1) // 2) // 2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by the integer division of `(d + 1)` by `2`, which is equivalent to adding the integer part of the result of `(d + 1) / 2` to `s`. The value of `d` has been decremented by the integer division of `(d + 1)` by `2`, which is equivalent to subtracting the integer part of the result of `(d + 1) / 2` from `d`. The value of `i` has been incremented by `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
