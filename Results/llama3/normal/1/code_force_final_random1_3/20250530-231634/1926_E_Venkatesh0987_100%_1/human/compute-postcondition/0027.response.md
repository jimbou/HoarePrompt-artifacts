Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is ((n + 1) // 2), i is 1, d is (n - 1) // 2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**

In this output state, the values of `_t`, `n`, `k`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `s` is incremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `d` is decremented by `(d + 1) // 2`, resulting in `(n - 1) // 2`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `f` and `y` are not modified by the code, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
