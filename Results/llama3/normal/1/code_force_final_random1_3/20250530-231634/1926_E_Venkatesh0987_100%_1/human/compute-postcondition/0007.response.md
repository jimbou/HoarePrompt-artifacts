According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `d`. If `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, and `d` is `(n - 1) // 2 - (d + 1) // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be less than `k`, so `s` must be less than `(n + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 + 1`. Also, `d` must be greater than 0, so `(n - 1) // 2 - (d + 1) // 2` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `k` is an integer greater than (n + 1) // 2, `s` is less than (n + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 + 1, `i` is 2, `d` is greater than 0, `h` is n, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: t - 2 pairs of integers n and k**
