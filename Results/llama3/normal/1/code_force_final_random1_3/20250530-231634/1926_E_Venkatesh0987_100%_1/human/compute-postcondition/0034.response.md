Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i must be more than 1 and is the smallest integer i such that s >= k, d is 0, h is (n + 1) // 2, p is 2, g is (n + 1) // 2, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not**

The code modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the ceiling of `h` divided by 2, which is equivalent to `(h + 1) // 2`. Since `h` is initially `n`, this expression evaluates to `(n + 1) // 2`, making `g` equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. The second line subtracts the same value from `h`, making it `(n + 1) // 2`. The third line simply increments `p` by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
