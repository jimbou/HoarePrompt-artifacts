To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `p` and `i` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2 and `i` is greater than or equal to 2.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. Since `p` is 2, we need to adjust `i` to be greater than or equal to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i is greater than or equal to 3, d is 0, h is (n + 1) // 2, p is 2, g is (n + 1) // 2, _ is 2, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**
