Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i is the smallest integer i such that s >= k, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the value of `s` is equal to `k`, `i` is the smallest integer such that `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `d` is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
