According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 50000) and then t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 50000) and then t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), _ is 0, input() must be at least 1**
