The code prints the value of y which is calculated as 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1). Here, i is the smallest integer i such that s >= k, k is an integer between 1 and n, and n is an integer between 1 and 10^9.

Output: **2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) (where i is the smallest integer i such that s >= k, k is an integer between 1 and n, and n is an integer between 1 and 10^9)**
