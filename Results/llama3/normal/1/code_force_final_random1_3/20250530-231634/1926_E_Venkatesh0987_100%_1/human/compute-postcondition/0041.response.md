Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is k, i is the smallest integer i such that s >= k, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1)**

In this output state, the values of `_t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `_` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `f` is updated to `k - n`, and the value of `y` is updated to `2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1)`.
