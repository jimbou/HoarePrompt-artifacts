Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than 2, d is 0, h is (n+1)//4 - (n+1)//4 // 2, p is less than or equal to i, g is (3n+3)//4 + (n+1)//4 // 2 + (n+1)//4 // 2, _ is 0, stdin contains t - i inputs: t - i pairs of integers n and k.**

The code modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the integer division of `(h + 1)` by `2`, which is equivalent to the integer division of `(n+1)//4 + 1` by `2`. The second line decrements `h` by the integer division of `(h + 1)` by `2`, which is equivalent to the integer division of `(n+1)//4 + 1` by `2`. The third line increments `p` by `1`. No other variables are affected.
