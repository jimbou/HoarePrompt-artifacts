Output State: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer greater than ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n - 1) // 2) // 2 and less than or equal to n, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n - 1) // 2) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2, i is 3, d is (n - 1) // 2 - ((n - 1) // 2) // 2 - (d + 1) // 2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 1, f is k - n, and y is either 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) or 2k - 1 depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.**

Explanation: The code modifies the values of `s`, `d`, and `i`. The first line increments `s` by the integer division of `d + 1` by 2. The second line decrements `d` by the same value. The third line increments `i` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
