Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 2 and 10^9, k is an integer greater than (n + 1) // 2, s is less than (n + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 + 1, i is 3, d is greater than 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 3 inputs: t - 3 pairs of integers n and k**

The first line increments `s` by the value of `(d + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `d + 1` by 2. Since `d` is greater than 0, `(d + 1) // 2` is also greater than 0. Therefore, `s` increases by a positive value.

The second line decrements `d` by the value of `(d + 1) // 2`, which is the same value used in the first line. Since `d` is greater than 0, `(d + 1) // 2` is also greater than 0. Therefore, `d` decreases by a positive value.

The third line increments `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 3.

No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `_` remain unchanged. The number of inputs in stdin decreases by 1, leaving `t - 3` pairs of integers `n` and `k`.
