Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, _ is 0, f is k - n, y is 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1), stdin contains t - i inputs: t - i pairs of integers n and k.**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the value of `k - g` to `f`. Since `g` is `n`, `f` becomes `k - n`. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` to `y`. Since `f` is `k - n`, `y` becomes `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * (k - n) - 1)`, which simplifies to `2 ** (i - 1) * (2k - 2n - 1)`. No other variables are affected.
