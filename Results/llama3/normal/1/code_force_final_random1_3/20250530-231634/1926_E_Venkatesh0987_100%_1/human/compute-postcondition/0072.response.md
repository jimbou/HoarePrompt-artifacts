Postcondition: **_t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then s is k, i is the number of iterations needed to reach s >= k, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is the sum of (n + 1) // 2^j for j from 1 to i - 1, _ is 2, f is k - g, and y is 2^(i-1) * (2k - 2n - 1) and y is printed. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 2, f is k - n, and y is 2k - 1, which is equal to 2 times the value of k minus 1, where k is an integer between 1 and n and k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of 2 * k - 1 is being printed.**
