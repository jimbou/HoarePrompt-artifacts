Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is 0, h is (n+1)//2, p is 2, g is (n+1)//2, _ is 0, stdin contains t - i inputs: t - i pairs of integers n and k.**

The code block modifies the values of variables g, h, and p. The first line increments g by the integer division of (h + 1) by 2, which is equivalent to the ceiling of (h + 1) / 2. Since h is initially equal to n, g becomes (n + 1) // 2. The second line decrements h by the same value, making h equal to (n + 1) // 2. The third line simply increments p by 1, making p equal to 2. The remaining variables and the state of stdin remain unchanged.
