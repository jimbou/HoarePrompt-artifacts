Output State: **a is a list of four integers, cnt is 0**

The first line assigns a new list of four integers to `a`, overwriting its previous value. The second line resets `cnt` to 0, discarding its previous value. The value of `x` is not affected by the code snippet, but since `a` has been reassigned, `x` is no longer the fourth element of `a`. Stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers.
