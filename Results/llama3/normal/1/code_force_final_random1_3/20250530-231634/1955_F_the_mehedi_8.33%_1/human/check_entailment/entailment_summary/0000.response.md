Reasoning:

The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

The key insight is that Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. This happens when the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence is even. The program calculates the sum of the integer parts of these integers divided by 2, which effectively counts the number of pairs of each number. If the first three integers are equal and odd, it increments the count by 1, because in this case, Bob can win by removing one of each number.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
