Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1 or more than 1 plus the integer division of the third element in `a` by 2 plus the integer division of the third element in `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer division of the third element in `a` by 2 to its previous value. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
