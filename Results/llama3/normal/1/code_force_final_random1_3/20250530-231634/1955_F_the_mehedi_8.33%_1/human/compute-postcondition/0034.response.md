Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `cnt` is increased by the integer part of `x` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` still contains four integers with at least two elements. The value of `x` remains the same as the second element in the list `a`. The value of `cnt` has been increased by the integer part of `x` divided by 2, which means it has been incremented by the largest integer less than or equal to `x/2`.
