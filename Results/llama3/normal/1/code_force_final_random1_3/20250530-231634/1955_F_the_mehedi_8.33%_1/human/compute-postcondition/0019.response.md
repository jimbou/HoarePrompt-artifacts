Output State: **`a` is a list of at least one integer, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer part of `x` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer part of `x` divided by 2 to its previous value, which was either 0 or 1. The other variables, `a` and `x`, remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 lines of input.
