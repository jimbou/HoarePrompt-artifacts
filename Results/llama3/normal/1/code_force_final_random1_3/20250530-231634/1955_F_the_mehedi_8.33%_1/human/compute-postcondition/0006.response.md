Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1 or more than 1, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, `cnt` is increased by the integer division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is the first element in `a` and `a` is a list of four integers, `x` can be any integer. Therefore, `cnt` can be either 0, 1 or more than 1. The values of `a` and `x` are not changed, and the stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
