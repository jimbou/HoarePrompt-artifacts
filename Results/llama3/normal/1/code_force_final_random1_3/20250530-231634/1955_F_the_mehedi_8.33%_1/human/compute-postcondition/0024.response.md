Output State: **`a` is a list of four integers, `x` is the fourth element of `a`, `cnt` is 1 plus the sum of the integer parts of all elements in `a` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged with four integers. The variable `x` takes the value of the fourth element in `a`. The variable `cnt` is updated to be 1 plus the sum of the integer parts of all elements in `a` divided by 2. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing t-1 lines, each with four integers p_i ranging from 0 to 200.
