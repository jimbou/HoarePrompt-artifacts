The value of `cnt` is increased by the integer part of `x` divided by 2. Since `x` is the third element of `a`, and `a` is a list of at least three integers, `x` is an integer. The integer part of `x` divided by 2 is `math.floor(x / 2)`. Therefore, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).

Output State: **`a` is a list of at least three integers, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is 1 plus the integer part of the second element of `a` divided by 2 plus the integer part of `x` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
