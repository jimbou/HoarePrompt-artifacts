Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `a` is a list of four integers, `x` is the fourth element in `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The state of the stdin also remains the same, as no input was read or modified.
