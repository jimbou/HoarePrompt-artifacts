The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` is 0, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of `a` and the contents of `stdin` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `a` is a list of four integers where the first three elements are equal and odd, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
