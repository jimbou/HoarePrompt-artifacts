Output State: **cnt is either 0, 1 or more than 1 plus the integer division of the first element in a by 2 plus the integer division of the second element in a by 2 plus the integer division of the third element in a by 2 plus the integer division of the fourth element in a by 2, a is a list of four integers, x is the fourth element in a, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `cnt` will be the initial value (0 or 1) plus the sum of the integer divisions of all elements in the list `a` by 2. The list `a` remains unchanged, and the variable `x` takes the value of the last element in the list `a`. The state of the input stream `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-1` lines, each with four integers `p_i` between 0 and 200.
