Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of four integers, cnt is 0**

The first line reads the first line from stdin, which contains four integers, and assigns them to the list `a`. Since stdin initially contains `t` lines, after reading the first line, it now contains `t-1` lines. The second line initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected.
