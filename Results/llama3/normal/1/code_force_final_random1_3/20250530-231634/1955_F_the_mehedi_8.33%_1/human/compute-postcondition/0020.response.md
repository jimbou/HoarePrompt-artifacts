The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least one integer, `x` is the first element of `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `x` is the second element of `a`. The state of `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer part of `x` divided by 2, so `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer part of the second element of `a` divided by 2. The state of `stdin` is not changed because it is not in the loop head.
State: **`a` is a list of at least two integers, `x` is the second element of `a`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer part of the second element of `a` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
