Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input test cases and processes each case individually.
2. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the integer parts of the four integers divided by 2, which represents the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. This is because each pair of identical numbers can be removed to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero, allowing Bob to win.
3. The program also correctly handles the special case where the first three integers are equal and odd. In this case, an additional increment is added to the count, because removing one of these numbers would make the XOR of the remaining numbers non-zero, allowing Alice to win.
4. The program prints the calculated count for each test case, which is the correct output.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
