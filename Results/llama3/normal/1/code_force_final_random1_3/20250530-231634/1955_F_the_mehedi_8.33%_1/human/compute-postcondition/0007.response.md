The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 1 element, x is the first element in a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the x is the second element in the list.
State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1 or more than 1, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
