Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *cnt is either 0 or 1, a is a list of four integers, x is the fourth element in a, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). If the first three elements of a are equal and odd, then cnt is 1, otherwise cnt remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt += math.floor(x / 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of at least one integer, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1 plus the integer part of `x` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of at least two integers, `x` is the second element of `a`, `cnt` is 1 plus the integer part of the second element of `a` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of at least three integers, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is 1 plus the integer part of the second element of `a` divided by 2 plus the integer part of `x` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
