The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, x is the second element of a, cnt is 1 plus the integer part of the second element of a divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element of a.
State: **`a` is a list of at least three integers, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is 1 plus the integer part of the second element of `a` divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
