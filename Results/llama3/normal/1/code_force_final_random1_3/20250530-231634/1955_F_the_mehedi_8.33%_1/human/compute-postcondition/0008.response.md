Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1 or more than 1 plus the integer division of the second element in `a` by 2, `a` is a list of four integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer division of `x` (the second element in `a`) by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains four integers with at least two elements, and `x` is still the second element in `a`. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each with four integers p_i ranging from 0 to 200.
