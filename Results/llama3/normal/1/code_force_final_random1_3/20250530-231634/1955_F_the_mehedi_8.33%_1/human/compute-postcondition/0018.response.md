To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a list of four integers, we can adjust its state to ensure it has at least one element.

The state of `x` is not explicitly defined before the loop, but since it will take on the value of each element in `a` during the loop, we can adjust its state to be the first element of `a`.

The other variables, `cnt`, `stdin`, and the conditions related to the first three elements of `a` being equal and odd, are not directly related to the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of at least one integer, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
