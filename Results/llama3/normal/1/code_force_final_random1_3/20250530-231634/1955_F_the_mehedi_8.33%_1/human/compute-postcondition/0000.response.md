The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). So for the loop to be executed  the `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), int(input()) is greater than 0, _ is 0**
