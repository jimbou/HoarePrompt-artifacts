Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is n if n is odd, otherwise i is n-1. If n is odd, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<', then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'yes' is printed.**
