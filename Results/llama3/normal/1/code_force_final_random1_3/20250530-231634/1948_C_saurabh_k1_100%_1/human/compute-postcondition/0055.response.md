Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 5, 'No' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases. 'No' is still being printed.
