Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It then checks if the strings satisfy a certain condition: for every pair of characters at odd indices, neither the current character in the first string nor the previous character in the second string can be '<'. If this condition is met for all pairs, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
