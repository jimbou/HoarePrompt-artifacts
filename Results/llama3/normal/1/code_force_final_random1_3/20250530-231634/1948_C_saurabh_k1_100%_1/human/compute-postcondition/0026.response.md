Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. Additionally, either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<'. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the string 'No' has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the string 'No' has been printed. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
