Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code reads three lines from stdin: an integer `n`, and two strings `a` and `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, as one test case is read by the code.
