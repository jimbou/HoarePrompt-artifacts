Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is n if n is odd, otherwise i is n-1. If n is odd, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<', then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'yes' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be either `n` if `n` is odd or `n-1` if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, the program will print 'yes'. If `n` is even, the program will check the conditions `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. If these conditions are true, the program will print 'No'. Otherwise, it will print 'yes'. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
