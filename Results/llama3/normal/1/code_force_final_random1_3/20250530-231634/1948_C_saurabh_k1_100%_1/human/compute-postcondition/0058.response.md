Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, _ is t, stdin contains 0 test cases, i is n if n is odd, otherwise i is n-1. If for all i in range(1, n, 2), neither a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' nor a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<' is true, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

This output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the loop head and body have affected the variables as follows:

- `_` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times.
- `stdin` contains 0 test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- `i` is either `n` (if `n` is odd) or `n-1` (if `n` is even), indicating that the inner loop has finished executing.
- The output is either 'yes' or 'No', depending on whether the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` were true for any `i` in the range.

The state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
