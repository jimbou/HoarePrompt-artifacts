The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n` and `i` is incremented by 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2, so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 5, a is a string, b is a string, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 5**
