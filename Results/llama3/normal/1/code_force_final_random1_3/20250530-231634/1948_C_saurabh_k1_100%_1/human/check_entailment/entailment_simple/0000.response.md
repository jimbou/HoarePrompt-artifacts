Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions. The program iterates over the grid in steps of 2, checking if there are any arrows pointing left that would prevent the robot from reaching the cell (2, n). If it finds such an arrow, it prints 'No'. If it doesn't find any such arrows, it prints 'yes'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
