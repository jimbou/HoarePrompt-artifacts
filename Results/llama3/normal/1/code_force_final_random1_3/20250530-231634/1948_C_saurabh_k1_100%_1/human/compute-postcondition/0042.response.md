Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. Additionally, either the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` are both '<', or the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` are both '<'.**
