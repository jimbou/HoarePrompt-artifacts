Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

    4
    >><<
    >><>

The program will print 'yes', but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because the arrows in the second row are pointing to the left, and the robot cannot move to the right.

The program only checks if there are any pairs of arrows pointing to the left in the same column, but it does not consider the case where the arrows in the second row are pointing to the left, and the robot cannot move to the right.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there is a path from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) by simulating the robot's movement and checking if it can reach the target cell.
