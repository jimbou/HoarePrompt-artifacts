Based on the initial state, the code will print the string 'No'. The value of the variable 't' is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 0, but it is not used in the print statement. The value of the variable 'n' is an integer greater than or equal to 5, but it is also not used in the print statement. The values of the variables 'a' and 'b' are strings, but they are not used in the print statement. The value of the variable '_' is 0, but it is not used in the print statement. The value of the variable 'i' is 5, but it is not used in the print statement. The stdin contains t-1 test cases, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.

Output: **No**
