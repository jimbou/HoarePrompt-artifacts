The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an odd number plus 2, `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is an odd number plus 4, and `n` must be greater than `i`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is an odd number plus 4**
