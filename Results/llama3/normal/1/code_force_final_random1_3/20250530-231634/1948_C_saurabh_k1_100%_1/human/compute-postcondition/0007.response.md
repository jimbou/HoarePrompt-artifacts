Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a string, b is a string, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, n, a, b, and _ remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The value of i is still 1. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the execution of the break statement.
