Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
