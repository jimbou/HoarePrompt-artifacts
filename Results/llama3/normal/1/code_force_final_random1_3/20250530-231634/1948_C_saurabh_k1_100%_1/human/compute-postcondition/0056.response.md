Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then 'No' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
