stdin contains a sequence of lines. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two lines, each containing a string of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>'. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.
