Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. Additionally, either the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` are both '<', or the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` are both '<'. 'No' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain the same. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases. The value of `i` is still 1, and the conditions regarding the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are still valid. Additionally, the program has printed 'No' and has exited the innermost loop or if statement.
