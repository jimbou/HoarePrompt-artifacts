The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 2 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 5**
