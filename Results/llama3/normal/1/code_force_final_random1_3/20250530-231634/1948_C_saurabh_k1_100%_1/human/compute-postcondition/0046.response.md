Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 1. If `i + 1` is less than `n` and either the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` are both '<', or the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` are both '<', then 'No' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action has been taken.***
