Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is an odd number plus 4, the string 'No' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases. The string 'No' is still being printed. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
