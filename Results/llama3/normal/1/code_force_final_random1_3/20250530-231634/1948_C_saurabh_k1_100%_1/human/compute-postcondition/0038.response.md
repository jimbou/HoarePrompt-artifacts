Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is `n` if `n` is odd, otherwise `i` is `n-1`. If `n` is odd, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'yes' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` also remains unchanged, `a` and `b` remain strings, and `_` remains 1. The value of `i` is now either `n` if `n` is odd or `n-1` if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, then the string 'yes' is printed. If `n` is even, then if `i + 1` is less than `n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'yes' is printed.
