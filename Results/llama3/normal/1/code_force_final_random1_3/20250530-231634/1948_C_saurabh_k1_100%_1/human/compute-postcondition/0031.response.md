Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is an odd number plus 2, 'No' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1. The value of `n` remains an integer and must be greater than `i`. The values of `a` and `b` remain strings. The value of `_` remains 1. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases. The value of `i` remains an odd number plus 2. 'No' is still being printed.
