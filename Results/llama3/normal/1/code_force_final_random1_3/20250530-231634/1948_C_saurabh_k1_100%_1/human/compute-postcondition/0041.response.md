The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n if n is odd, otherwise i is n-1. So for the loop to be executed  n must be greater than or equal to 3 and i is 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 1**
