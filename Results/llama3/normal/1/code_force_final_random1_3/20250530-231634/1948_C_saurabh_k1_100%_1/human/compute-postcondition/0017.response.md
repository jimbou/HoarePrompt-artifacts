Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 5, a is a string, b is a string, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 5, 'No' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, n, a, b, _, and i remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases because we have already processed one test case and broken out of the loop. The 'No' is still being printed, and we have exited the most internal loop or if statement due to the break statement.
