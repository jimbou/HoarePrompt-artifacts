Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is an odd number plus 2. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then 'No' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
