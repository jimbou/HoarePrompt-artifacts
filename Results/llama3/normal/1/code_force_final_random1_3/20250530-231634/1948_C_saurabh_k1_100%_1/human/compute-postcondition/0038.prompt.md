Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n if n is odd, otherwise i is n-1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('No')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If `i + 1` is less than `n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<', then the string 'No' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is an odd number plus 2. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then 'No' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is an odd number plus 4. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then the string 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
