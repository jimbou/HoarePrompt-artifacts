The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters. `n` is even.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters. `n` is even.**
