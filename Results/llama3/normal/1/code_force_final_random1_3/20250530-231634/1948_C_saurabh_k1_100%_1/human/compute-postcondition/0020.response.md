State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `n` if `n` is odd, otherwise `i` is `n-1`. If for all `i` in range(1, `n`, 2), neither `a[i]` == `b[i + 1]` == '<' nor `a[i]` == `b[i - 1]` == '<' is true, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
