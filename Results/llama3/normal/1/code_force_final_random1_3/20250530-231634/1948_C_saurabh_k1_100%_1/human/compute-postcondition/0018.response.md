Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 5, a is a string, b is a string, _ is 0, if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<', then 'No' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and i is 5.**
