The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `n` if `n` is odd, otherwise `i` is `n-1`. If `n` is odd, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'yes' is printed.**
