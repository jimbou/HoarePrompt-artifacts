Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. Additionally, either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<'. The string 'No' is being printed**
