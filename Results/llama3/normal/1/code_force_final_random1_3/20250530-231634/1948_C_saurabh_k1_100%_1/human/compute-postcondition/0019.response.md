Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n if n is odd, otherwise i is n-1. If for all i in range(1, n, 2), neither a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' nor a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<' is true, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be either `n` (if `n` is odd) or `n-1` (if `n` is even). The loop will print 'yes' if none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are true for any `i` in the range. Otherwise, it will print 'No'. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases.
