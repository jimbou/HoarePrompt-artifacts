Output State: **x is 2, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is an empty list, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is None, two is True, one is True, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The value of x remains 2, the value of y remains 1, the dictionary lst remains unchanged with one key-value pair where the key is 'a' and the value is an empty list, the dictionary rev has one key-value pair where the key is 'b' and the value is an empty list, the value of z remains equal to u_1, the value of tmp is None, the value of two is True, the value of one is True, and the stdin remains empty.
