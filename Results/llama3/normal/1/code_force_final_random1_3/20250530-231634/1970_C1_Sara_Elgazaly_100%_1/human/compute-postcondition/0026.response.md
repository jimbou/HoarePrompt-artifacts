Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, constructs two directed graphs (lst and rev) from the input, and then performs a series of operations on these graphs. It iterates through the graphs in a specific order, toggling a boolean value (one and two) at each step. Finally, it prints 'Hermione' if both boolean values are True after the iterations, otherwise it prints 'Ron'. The function does not return any value, and its only output is the printed string.**
