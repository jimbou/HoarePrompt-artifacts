According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable lst and tmp. If lst[tmp] is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b x-2 times, and tmp is b. Since lst[tmp] is not empty, the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **x is an integer greater than 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b x-2 times, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a x-1 times, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is b, one is False, stdin is empty**
