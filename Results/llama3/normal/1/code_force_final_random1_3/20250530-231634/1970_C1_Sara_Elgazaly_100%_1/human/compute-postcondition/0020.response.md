Output State: **x is 2, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where one of the keys is u_1 and its value is a list with at least one element minus one, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is the last element of the list that was the value of u_1, two is True, one is True, stdin is empty**

The first line of the code changes the value of `two` from False to True. The second line modifies the value of `tmp` by popping the last element from the list that is the value of `u_1` in the `rev` dictionary. Since `tmp` was equal to `u_1`, it now holds the last element of the list that was the value of `u_1`. The list that was the value of `u_1` in the `rev` dictionary now has one less element. No other variables are affected by the code.
