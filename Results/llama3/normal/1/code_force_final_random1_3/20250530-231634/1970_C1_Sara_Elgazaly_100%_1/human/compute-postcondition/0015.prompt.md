Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer equal to 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b x-1 times, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a x-1 times, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is an integer equal to u_1, one is True, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: x is an integer greater than 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b x-2 times, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a x-1 times, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is b, one is False, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: x is an integer greater than 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b x-3 times, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a x-1 times, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is a, one is True, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: x is an integer greater than 4, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b x-4 times, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a x-1 times, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is b, one is False, stdin is empty


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
