Output State: **x is an integer equal to 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b x-1 times, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a x-1 times, stdin contains one integer u_1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that x has been decremented to 1, y remains unchanged at 1, the dictionary lst has one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b repeated x-1 times, the dictionary rev has one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a repeated x-1 times, and the standard input stdin contains only one integer u_1.
