Let's break down the print statement step by step:

1. The print statement is a conditional expression that checks the values of `two` and `one`.
2. According to the initial state, `two` is `True` and `one` is also `True`.
3. Since both `two` and `one` are `True`, the condition `two and one` evaluates to `True`.
4. When the condition is `True`, the print statement will print the string `'Hermione'`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'Hermione'`.

Output: **Hermione**
