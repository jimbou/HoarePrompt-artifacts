Output State: **x is 2, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where one of the keys is u_1 and its value is a list with at least two elements, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is the second last element of the list that was the value of u_1, two is False, one is True, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the value of `two` has been toggled to `False` due to the first line of code. The second line of code removes the last element from the list that was the value of `u_1` in the `rev` dictionary and assigns it to `tmp`. As a result, the list that was the value of `u_1` now has at least two elements, and `tmp` holds the second last element of that list. All other variables remain unchanged.
