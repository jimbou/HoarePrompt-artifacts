Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is 2, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a x-1 times, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is u_1, two is True, one is True, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: x is 2, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is u_1 and the value is a list with one less element than before, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is the last element of the list that was the value of u_1 in the rev dictionary, two is False, one is True, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: x is 2, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where one of the keys is u_1 and its value is a list with at least one element minus one, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is the last element of the list that was the value of u_1, two is True, one is True, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: x is 2, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where one of the keys is u_1 and its value is a list with at least two elements, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is the second last element of the list that was the value of u_1, two is False, one is True, stdin is empty


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
