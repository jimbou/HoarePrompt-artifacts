To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(x - 1):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is 1, `lst` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, `rev` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, `stdin` contains n-4 lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one integer `u_1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `lst[a]` is a list containing `b`, `rev[b]` is a list containing `a`**
