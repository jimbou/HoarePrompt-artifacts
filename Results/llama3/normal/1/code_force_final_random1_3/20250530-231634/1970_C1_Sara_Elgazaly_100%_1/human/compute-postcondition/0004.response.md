Output State: **x is an integer greater than 2, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair, stdin contains n-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one integer u_1, a is an integer, b is an integer, lst[a] is a list containing b, rev[b] is a list containing a**

The code reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `a` and `b`. It then appends `b` to the list associated with key `a` in the dictionary `lst`, and appends `a` to the list associated with key `b` in the dictionary `rev`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one line of input has been consumed.
