Output State: **x is an integer greater than 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is a and the value is a list containing b x-3 times, rev is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is b and the value is a list containing a x-1 times, z is an integer equal to u_1, tmp is a, one is True, stdin is empty**

Explanation:

The first line of code, `one = not one`, changes the value of `one` from `False` to `True`.

The second line of code, `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()`, modifies the value of `tmp` and the dictionary `lst`. Since `tmp` is initially `b`, `lst[tmp]` refers to the list containing `b` x-2 times. The `pop()` method removes the last element from this list, which is `b`, and assigns it to `tmp`. As a result, `tmp` becomes `a` (the key of the dictionary), and the list in `lst` now contains `b` x-3 times.

All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still an integer greater than 1, `y` is still 1, `z` is still an integer equal to `u_1`, and `rev` is still a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `b` and the value is a list containing `a` x-1 times. The stdin is still empty.
