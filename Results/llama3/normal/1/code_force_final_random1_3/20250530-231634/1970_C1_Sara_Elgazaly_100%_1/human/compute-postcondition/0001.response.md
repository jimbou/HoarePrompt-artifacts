To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 1. Since `x` is an integer equal to the first input integer `n`, we can adjust `n` to be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is 1, `lst` is a dictionary with no keys, `rev` is a dictionary with no keys, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one integer `u_1`**
