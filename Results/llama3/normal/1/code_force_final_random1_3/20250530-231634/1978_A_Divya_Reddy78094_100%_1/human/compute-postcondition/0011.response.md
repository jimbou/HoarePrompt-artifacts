The code prints the sum of the maximum value of all elements in the list `nums` except the last element, and the last element of the list `nums`. The maximum value is determined by the `max` function, which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. The `[:-1]` slice notation is used to exclude the last element of the list, and `[-1]` is used to access the last element.

Output: **max value of all elements in the list nums except the last element + last element of the list nums**
