Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, stdin contains t-6 test cases**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, `n` becomes an integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `nums`. Since stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `nums` becomes a list of integers. Stdin now contains `t-6` test cases. The value of `_` remains unchanged.
