To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive

The other variables, `n`, `nums`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases**
