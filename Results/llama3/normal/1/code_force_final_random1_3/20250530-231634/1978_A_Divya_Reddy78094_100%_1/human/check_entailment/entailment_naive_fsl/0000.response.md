Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2 3

The program will output 5, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 5, because Alice can put the book with 3 pages in one pile and the books with 1 and 2 pages in the other pile, and then read the book with 3 pages from the first pile and the book with 2 pages from the second pile, for a total of 3 + 2 = 5 pages.

The issue with the program is that it simply takes the maximum of the first n-1 numbers and adds it to the last number, without considering the actual maximum number of pages that can be read by dividing the books into two piles.
