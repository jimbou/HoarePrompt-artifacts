Reasoning:
The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. The key insight is that Alice will always read the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. By sorting the books in descending order, the program can simply add the highest book from the first pile (which is the maximum of all elements except the last one) and the highest book from the second pile (which is the last element). This ensures that Alice reads the maximum total number of pages possible.

Correctness: **True**
