Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer, its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `nums`. Since `nums` was already a list of integers, its value is updated to the input list.

The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not used or modified by the code.

The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2, as two inputs are read from stdin. Therefore, the number of test cases in stdin becomes `t-4`.

In summary, the code updates the values of `n` and `nums` to the input values, and decreases the number of test cases in stdin by 2. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
