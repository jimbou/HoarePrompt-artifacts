Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not used or modified in the code. The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, so `n` becomes an integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `nums`, so `nums` becomes a list of integers. After the first test case is processed, there are `t-1` test cases remaining in stdin.
