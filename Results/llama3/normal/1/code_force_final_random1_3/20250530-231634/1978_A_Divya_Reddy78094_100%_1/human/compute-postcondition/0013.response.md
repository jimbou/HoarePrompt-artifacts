Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, stdin is empty, and the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list nums except the last one and the last element of the list nums has been printed t times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, the variable `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, the variable `n` will still be an integer, the variable `nums` will still be a list of integers, the standard input (`stdin`) will be empty because all test cases have been processed, and the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list `nums` except the last one and the last element of the list `nums` will have been printed `t` times.
