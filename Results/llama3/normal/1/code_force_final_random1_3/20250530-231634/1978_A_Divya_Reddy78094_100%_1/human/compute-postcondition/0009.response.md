The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1, so _ is 2 and t must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and this is printed: the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list nums except the last one and the last element of the list nums**
