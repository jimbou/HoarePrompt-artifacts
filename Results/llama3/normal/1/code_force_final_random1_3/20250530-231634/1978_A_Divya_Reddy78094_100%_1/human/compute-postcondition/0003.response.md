The `print` statement will print the sum of the maximum value of all elements in the list `nums` except the last element (`max(nums[:-1])`) and the last element of the list `nums` (`nums[-1]`).

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the maximum value of all elements in the list `nums` except the last element and the last element of the list `nums`.

Output: **the sum of the maximum value of all elements in the list nums except the last element and the last element of the list nums**
