Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. The given program attempts to solve this problem by finding the maximum number of pages in the first n-1 books and adding it to the number of pages in the nth book.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement does not guarantee that the nth book will be in the same pile as the book with the maximum number of pages. In fact, the problem statement explicitly states that each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles, which means that the nth book could be in either pile.

A correct approach would be to find the maximum number of pages in the first n-1 books and add it to the second maximum number of pages in the first n-1 books. This would ensure that we are considering the maximum number of pages that can be read from both piles.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
