Output: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case. If `k` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the next test case from stdin, and the value 1 is not printed for the current test case. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is being printed**
