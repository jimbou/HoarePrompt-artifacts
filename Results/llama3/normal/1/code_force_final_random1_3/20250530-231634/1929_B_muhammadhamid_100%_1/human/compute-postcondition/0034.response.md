Output: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case. If `k` equals 1, the integer 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration, and the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed**
