Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the next test case from the input, which are integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but now it has at least 1 test case left. The variable `_` is still the next test case.
