Output State: **All test cases have been processed and their corresponding outputs have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has iterated over all the test cases provided in the input, and for each test case, it has printed the appropriate output based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop has now terminated, and all the required outputs have been generated.
