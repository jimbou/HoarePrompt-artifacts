Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed, where `k // 2 + 1` is the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1.***
