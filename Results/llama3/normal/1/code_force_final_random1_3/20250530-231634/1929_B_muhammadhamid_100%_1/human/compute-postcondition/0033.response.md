The code prints the integer division of `k` by 2, plus 1. Since `k` is an integer, the division `k // 2` will result in the largest whole number less than or equal to `k` divided by 2. Adding 1 to this result gives the final output.
Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the current value of k in the loop)**
