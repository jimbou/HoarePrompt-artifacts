According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the stdin must have at least 1 test case and the input is the first test case.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, input is the first test case**
