The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. In this case, since we are already inside a loop that iterates over the test cases, the `continue` statement will move to the next test case.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values of the next test case from stdin, and the value 1 is not printed for the current test case, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case**
