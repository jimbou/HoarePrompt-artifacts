To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as there are more test cases in the input.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` and `k` are integers, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. The value of `_` is the next test case from `stdin`.

For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more test case in `stdin`. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `stdin` to reflect this.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `_` is the next test case.**

Note that we don't need to adjust the values of `n` and `k` because they are not part of the loop head. The loop head only depends on the number of test cases in `stdin`.
