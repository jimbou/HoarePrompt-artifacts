Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case, and the integer 1 is being printed, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least one test case remaining. The variable `_` is still the next test case. The integer 1 is still being printed. However, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration, effectively bypassing any remaining code within the current iteration.
