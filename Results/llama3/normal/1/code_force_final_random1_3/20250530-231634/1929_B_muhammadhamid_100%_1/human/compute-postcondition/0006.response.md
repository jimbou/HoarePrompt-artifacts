Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
