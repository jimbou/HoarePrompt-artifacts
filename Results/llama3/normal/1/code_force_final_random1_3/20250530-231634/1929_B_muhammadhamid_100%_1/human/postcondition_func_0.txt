This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two integers, n and k. It calculates and prints the corresponding output for each test case based on the value of k, either printing 1, the ceiling of k divided by 2, or k divided by 2 plus 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, having printed the outputs for all cases.
