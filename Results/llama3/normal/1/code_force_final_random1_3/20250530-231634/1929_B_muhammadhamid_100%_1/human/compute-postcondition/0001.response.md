Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case**

In this output state, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been consumed.
