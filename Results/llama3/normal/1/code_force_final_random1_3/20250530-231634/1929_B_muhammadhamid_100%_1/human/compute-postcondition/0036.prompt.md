Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers: n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` is greater than 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed, where `k // 2 + 1` is the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case. If `k` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the next test case from stdin, and the value 1 is not printed for the current test case. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n` plus the difference between `n` and 2, the ceiling of half of the value of `k` is being printed. Otherwise, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case. If `k` equals 1, the integer 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. If `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n` plus `n` minus 2, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
