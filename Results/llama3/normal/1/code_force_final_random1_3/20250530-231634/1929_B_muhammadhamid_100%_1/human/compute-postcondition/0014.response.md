The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `stdin`. If `stdin` has at least 1 test case the loop executes again for the next test case. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` has at least 1 test case. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `stdin` must have at least 1 test case and the `_` is the next test case.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case**
