Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, the number 1 is being printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, with `k` still being 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least one test case. The number 1 is still being printed. However, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.
