Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case. If `k` equals 1, the integer 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. If `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n` plus `n` minus 2, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.**
