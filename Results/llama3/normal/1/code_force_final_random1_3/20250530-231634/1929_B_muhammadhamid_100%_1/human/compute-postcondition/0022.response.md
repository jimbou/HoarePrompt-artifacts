Based on the precondition, the code will print the value of `k // 2 + 1`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `k` is an integer, and its value is not specified in the precondition. However, we know that `k` is not 1, because if `k` were 1, the code would assign new values to `n` and `k` from the next test case in stdin, and the print statement would not be executed for the current test case.
* Since `k` is not 1, the expression `k // 2 + 1` will be evaluated. The `//` operator performs integer division, which rounds down to the nearest whole number.
* The value of `k // 2` will be an integer, and adding 1 to it will result in another integer.
* Therefore, the print statement will output an integer value, which is the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.

Output: **an integer value equal to k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer not equal to 1)**
