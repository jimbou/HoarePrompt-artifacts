Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case. If `k` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the next test case from stdin, and the value 1 is not printed for the current test case. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `k` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n` plus the difference between `n` and 2, the ceiling of half of the value of `k` is being printed. Otherwise, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is being printed.***
