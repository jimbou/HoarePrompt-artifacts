Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken. Additionally, `k` is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), and the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed, where `k // 2 + 1` is the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1**
