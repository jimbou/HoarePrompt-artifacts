Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `_` is the next test case, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first test case from stdin**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values of the first test case from stdin, which are integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been consumed. The variable `_` is still the next test case.
