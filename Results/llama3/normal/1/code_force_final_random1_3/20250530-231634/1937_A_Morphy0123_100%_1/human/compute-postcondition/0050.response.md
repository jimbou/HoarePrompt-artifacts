According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable power and n. If power is less than n, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, power is 1, n is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value. n being an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to n must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n_cases is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n must be greater than 1, power is 1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of power (which is 2) is being printed, stdin contains n_cases - 4 inputs**
