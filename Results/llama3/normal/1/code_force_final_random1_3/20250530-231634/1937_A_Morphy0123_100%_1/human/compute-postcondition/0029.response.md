According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `power` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value. `n` being an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value and greater than 1, `power` is 1, stdin contains n_cases - 3 inputs.**
