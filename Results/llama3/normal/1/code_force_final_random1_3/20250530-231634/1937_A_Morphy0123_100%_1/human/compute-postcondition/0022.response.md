Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs, and 2 raised to the power of `n` (where `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value) is being printed if `power` equals `n`, otherwise 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.**
