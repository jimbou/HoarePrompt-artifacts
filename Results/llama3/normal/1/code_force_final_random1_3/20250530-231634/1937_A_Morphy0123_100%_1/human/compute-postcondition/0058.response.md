The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, which is equal to `n` and also equal to the current value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^n) is equal to the original value of `n`.

Output: **the original value of n (which is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value)**
