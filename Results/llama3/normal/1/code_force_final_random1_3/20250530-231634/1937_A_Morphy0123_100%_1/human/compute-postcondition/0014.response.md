Output State: **n_cases is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, power is equal to n, stdin contains n_cases - 1 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `power` will be equal to `n`, which is the base-2 logarithm of its original value. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
