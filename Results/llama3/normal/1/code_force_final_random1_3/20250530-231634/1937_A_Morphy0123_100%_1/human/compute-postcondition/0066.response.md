Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `n_cases`, `n` is an integer, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^n) is being printed. If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is one less than its original value and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^(n-1)) is being printed. Additionally, if `n` is not 1, the number 1 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n_cases` is now 0, indicating that all cases have been processed. The loop variable `i` is equal to the original value of `n_cases`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable `n` still holds the last input value, and `power` is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value. The loop has printed the appropriate values for each case, either 1 if `n` is 1, or 2 raised to the power of `power` if `n` is not 1. The input stream is now empty, as all inputs have been processed.
