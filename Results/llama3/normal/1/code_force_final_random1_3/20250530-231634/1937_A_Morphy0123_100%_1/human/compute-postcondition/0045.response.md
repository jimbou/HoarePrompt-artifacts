The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and `n_cases` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.**
