Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed, stdin contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^n) is being printed. If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is one less than its original value and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^(n-1)) is being printed.***
