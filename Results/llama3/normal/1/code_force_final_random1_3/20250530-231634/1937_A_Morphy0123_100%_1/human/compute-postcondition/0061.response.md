Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is not equal to `n` and is one less than its original value, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^(n-1)) is being printed, stdin contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, resulting in a new value that is one less than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs. The value being printed is now 2 raised to the power of `power`, which is equivalent to 2^(n-1).
