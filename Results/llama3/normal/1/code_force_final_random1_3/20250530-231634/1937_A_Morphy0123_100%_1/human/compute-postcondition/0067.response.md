Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to each integer, and prints the result. If the input integer is 1, it simply prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the base-2 logarithm of the integer, rounds down to the nearest whole number if necessary, and prints the corresponding power of 2. The function processes multiple test cases, with the number of cases specified by the first integer in the input.**
