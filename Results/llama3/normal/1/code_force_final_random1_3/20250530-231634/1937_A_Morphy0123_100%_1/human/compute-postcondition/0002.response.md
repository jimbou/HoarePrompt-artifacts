Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs**.

In this output state, the value of `n_cases` remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer from the input, and since `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), there are `n_cases - 1` inputs left in the stdin.
