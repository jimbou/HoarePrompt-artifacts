Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 3, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^3 = 8) is being printed, stdin contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs**

The code increments the value of `power` by 1, so it changes from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is now 8, which is being printed. The stdin still contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs.
