Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `power` is 2, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` inputs**

The code increments the value of `power` by 1. Initially, `power` is 1, so after the increment, it becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n_cases` is still between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is still 0, and `n` is still greater than 1. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
