The code prints the result of raising 2 to the power of `power`, where `power` is equal to `n`, which is the base-2 logarithm of its original value.

Since `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, we can say that `n` is the exponent to which 2 must be raised to obtain the original value.

Therefore, `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** n`, which is equal to the original value.

However, since the exact original value is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 ** power`.

Output: **the original value (which is equal to 2 raised to the power of n, where n is the base-2 logarithm of the original value)**
