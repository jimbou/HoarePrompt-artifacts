Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is equal to `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^n) is being printed, stdin contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `power` has reached the value of `n`, which is the base-2 logarithm of its original value. The loop has printed the values of 2 raised to the power of `power` for each iteration, and the stdin contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged.
