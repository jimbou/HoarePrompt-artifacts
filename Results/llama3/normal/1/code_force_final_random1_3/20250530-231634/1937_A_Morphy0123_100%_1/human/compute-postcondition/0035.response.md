Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is equal to `n`, stdin contains n_cases - 3 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `n_cases` remains unchanged within the range of 2 to 10^4, `i` stays at 1, `n` remains the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` becomes equal to `n` after the loop finishes, and the standard input contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.
