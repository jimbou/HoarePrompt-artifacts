Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value and greater than 2, `power` is 3, stdin contains n_cases - 3 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 3. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the number of inputs in stdin remains the same, which is `n_cases - 3`.
