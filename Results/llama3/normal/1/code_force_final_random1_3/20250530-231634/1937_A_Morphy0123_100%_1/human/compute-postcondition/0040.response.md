Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is not equal to `n` and is one less than its original value, stdin contains n_cases - 3 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, but its relationship with `n` remains the same, i.e., `power` is not equal to `n`. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The number of inputs in stdin also remains the same, i.e., `n_cases - 3` inputs.
