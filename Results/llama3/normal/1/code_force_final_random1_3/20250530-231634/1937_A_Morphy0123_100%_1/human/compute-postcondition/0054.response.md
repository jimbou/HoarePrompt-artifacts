According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, `n` is greater than 2. `n` being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 3, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^3 = 8) is being printed, stdin contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs**
