Output State: **n_cases is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, power is 1, stdin contains n_cases - 3 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `n_cases` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 1. The value of `n` is updated to be the base-2 logarithm of its original value, which is a result of the second line of code. The variable `power` is assigned a value of 1. The state of stdin remains the same, containing `n_cases - 3` inputs.
