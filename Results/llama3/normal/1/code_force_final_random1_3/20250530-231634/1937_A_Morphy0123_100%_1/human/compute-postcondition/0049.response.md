Output State: **n_cases is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, power is 1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of power (which is 2) is being printed, stdin contains n_cases - 4 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `n_cases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be the base-2 logarithm of its original value, as specified by the second line of the code. The value of `power` is set to 1, as specified by the first line of the code. The value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2) is being printed, as specified by the problem statement. The state of stdin remains the same, containing `n_cases - 4` inputs.
