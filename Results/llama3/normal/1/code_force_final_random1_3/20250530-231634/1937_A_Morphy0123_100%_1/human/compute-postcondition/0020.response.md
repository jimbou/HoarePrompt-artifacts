To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1.  `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
2.  `i` is 0.
3.  `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value.
4.  `power` is not equal to `n` and is one less than its original value.
5.  stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.

Now, let's examine the print statement:

`print(2 ** power)`

The expression `2 ** power` calculates 2 raised to the power of `power`. Since `power` is one less than its original value and not equal to `n`, we can't determine the exact value of `power` without knowing its original value.

However, we can describe the output in terms of the given information. The print statement will output 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is one less than its original value.

Output: **2 raised to the power of (original value of power - 1)**
