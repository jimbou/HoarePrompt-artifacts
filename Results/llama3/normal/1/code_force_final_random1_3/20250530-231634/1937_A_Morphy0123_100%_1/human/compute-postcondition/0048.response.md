Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 4` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed**
