The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`, where `power` is one less than its original value and is not equal to `n`. Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value, we can infer that `power` is also related to the base-2 logarithm of its original value.

Output: **2 to the power of (one less than the base-2 logarithm of the original value of power)**
