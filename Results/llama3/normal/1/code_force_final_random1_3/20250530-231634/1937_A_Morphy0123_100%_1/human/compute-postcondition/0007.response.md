The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value 1 to the variable `power`. The second line calculates the base-2 logarithm of the value of `n` and assigns the result to `n`.

Output State: **n_cases is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, power is 1, stdin contains n_cases - 1 inputs**
