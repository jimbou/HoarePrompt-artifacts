Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value from the input, which was previously stored in stdin. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n_cases - 3` inputs, as one input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
