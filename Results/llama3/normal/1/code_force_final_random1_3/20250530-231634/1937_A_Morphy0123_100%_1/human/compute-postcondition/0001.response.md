To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n_cases`. If `n_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n_cases` is already an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), we can conclude that `n_cases` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so we need to adjust its state to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0**
