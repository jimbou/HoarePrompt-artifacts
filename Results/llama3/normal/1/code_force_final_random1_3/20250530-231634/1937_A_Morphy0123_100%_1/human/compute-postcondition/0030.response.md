Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value and greater than 1, `power` is 2, stdin contains n_cases - 3 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.
