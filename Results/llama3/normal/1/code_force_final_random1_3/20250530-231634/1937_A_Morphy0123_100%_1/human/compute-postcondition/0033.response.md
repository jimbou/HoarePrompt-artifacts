The variables in the loop head are power and n, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables power and n. If power is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, power is 3, n is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value and greater than 2. n being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value and greater than 3, `power` is 3, stdin contains n_cases - 3 inputs**
