Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 4, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^4 = 16) is being printed, stdin contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is now being printed, which is 2^4 = 16. The stdin still contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs.
