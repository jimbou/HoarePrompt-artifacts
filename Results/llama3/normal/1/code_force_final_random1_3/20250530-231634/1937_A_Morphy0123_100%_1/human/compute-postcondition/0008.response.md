To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `power < n`. The loop will execute if `power` is less than `n`. Given the initial states:

- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value
- `power` is 1
- `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` inputs

We focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n`. Since `power` is initially 1, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The initial state of `n` being an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value does not guarantee that `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure it is greater than 1.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `power` is 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` inputs**
