Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is equal to `n` and also equal to the current value of `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (which is 2^n) is being printed, stdin contains `n_cases` - 4 inputs.**
