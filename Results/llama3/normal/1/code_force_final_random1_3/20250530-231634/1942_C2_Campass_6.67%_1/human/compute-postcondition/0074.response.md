Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus c, sx is an integer greater than or equal to i and equal to its original value plus 4 times the value of y if y is less than c, otherwise sx remains unchanged, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 values of c, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the third value in the list val, c is equal to half of the third value in the list val, and stdin contains t - 3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of sx has been updated based on the value of y. If y is less than c, sx is now equal to its original value plus 4 times the value of y. Otherwise, sx remains unchanged. All other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
