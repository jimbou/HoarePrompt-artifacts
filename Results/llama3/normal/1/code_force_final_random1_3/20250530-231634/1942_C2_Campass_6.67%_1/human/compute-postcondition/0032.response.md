To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `val`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `val`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `val` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `val`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `val` must have at least 3 elements and `i` is the third element in the list `val`.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `val`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to the third element in the list `val` // 2, `sx` is increased by the third element in the list `val`, `y` is decreased by the third element in the list `val` // 2**
