To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `val`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `val` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `val` has at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in the list `val`.

For the loop to execute again, `val` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next element in the list `val`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times (i // 2) minus c, `sx` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value plus i, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list l minus 1, where the even numbers come first and must have at least 2 elements, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, `stdin` contains t - x test cases, `i` is the second element in the list val, `c` is equal to i // 2. If y is less than c, sx is increased by 2 times y.**
