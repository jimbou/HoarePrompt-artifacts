Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the value of `c`, `cons` has been printed, `i` is 2, `c` is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`**

The value of `c` is calculated as the difference between the third element of the list `l` and the second element of the list `l`, minus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `val` now contains the value of `c`. The program has not moved to the next test case, so `stdin` still contains `t - 2` test cases.
