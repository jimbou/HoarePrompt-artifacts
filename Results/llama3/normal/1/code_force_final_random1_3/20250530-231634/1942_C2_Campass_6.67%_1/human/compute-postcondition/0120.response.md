Output: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c minus the sum of all elements in val divided by 2, sx is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is an empty list, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - x test cases, i is the last element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2, and the value of cons which is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is being printed**
