Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c, `sx` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list l minus 1, where the even numbers come first, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - x test cases, `i` is equal to x, `c` is equal to the difference between the last element in the list l and the second last element in the list l minus 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `val` is now sorted. The sorting is done based on a custom key function that prioritizes even numbers over odd numbers. This means that all even numbers in the list will come before all odd numbers, and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
