Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the list consecutive, considering the given constraints (x, y), and prints the result for each test case. The function iterates through all test cases, modifying the input list and variables accordingly, until all test cases have been processed.**
