Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, sx is an integer greater than or equal to 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 values of c, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and cons has been printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, sx is an integer greater than or equal to i, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 values of c, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and cons has been printed, i is the first value in the list val, c is equal to half of the first value in the list val, y is an integer equal to its original value minus c.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus c, sx is an integer greater than or equal to i and equal to its original value plus 2 times the value of y if y is less than c, otherwise sx remains unchanged, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing x - 2 values of c, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the second value in the list val, c is equal to half of the second value in the list val, and stdin contains t - 2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 times c, sx is an integer greater than or equal to i and equal to its original value plus 4 times the value of y if y is less than c, otherwise sx remains unchanged, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 values of c, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the third value in the list val, c is equal to half of the third value in the list val, and stdin contains t - 3 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
