Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the second element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to the second element in the list val // 2, val is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, sx is increased by the second element in the list val, y is decreased by the second element in the list val // 2. If y is less than the second element in the list val // 2, sx is increased by 2y.**

In this output state, the value of c has been updated to be equal to the second element in the list val // 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
