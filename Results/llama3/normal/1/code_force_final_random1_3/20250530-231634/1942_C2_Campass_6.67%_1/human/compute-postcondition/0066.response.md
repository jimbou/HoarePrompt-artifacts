Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, sx is an integer greater than or equal to i, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 values of c, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and cons has been printed, i is the first value in the list val, c is equal to half of the first value in the list val, y is an integer equal to its original value minus c.**

The code increments sx by the value of i, which is the first value in the list val. Since sx was previously greater than or equal to 0, it remains greater than or equal to 0 after the increment. The second line decrements y by the value of c, which is half of the first value in the list val. The value of y is now its original value minus c. No other variables are affected by the code.
