Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, sx is an integer greater than or equal to 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 values of c, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and cons has been printed, i is the first value in the list val, c is equal to half of the first value in the list val**

In this output state, the value of c has been calculated as half of the first value in the list val, which is i. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t - 2 test cases.
