To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `val`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `val`. If `val` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c, `sx` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list l minus 1, where the even numbers come first and must have at least 1 element, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - x test cases, `i` is the first element in the list val, `c` is equal to the difference between the last element in the list l and the second last element in the list l minus 1**
