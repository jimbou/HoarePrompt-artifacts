Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to the last element in the list val // 2, val is an empty list, sx is increased by the sum of all elements in the list val plus y * 2 if y is less than the last element in the list val // 2, otherwise sx remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains the same as its original value minus 1.
- The value of `n` remains the same as an integer.
- The value of `x` remains the same as an integer greater than 0.
- The value of `y` remains the same as an integer.
- The value of `stdin` remains the same as containing `t - 1` test cases.
- The value of `i` is the last element in the list `val`.
- The value of `l` remains the same as a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list.
- The value of `c` is equal to the last element in the list `val` divided by 2.
- The value of `val` is an empty list.
- The value of `sx` is increased by the sum of all elements in the list `val` plus `y * 2` if `y` is less than the last element in the list `val` divided by 2, otherwise `sx` remains unchanged.
