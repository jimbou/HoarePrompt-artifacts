Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the difference between the second element in the list `l` and the first element in the list `l` minus 1, and c, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, `stdin` contains t - x test cases, `i` is 2, `c` is equal to the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1. If c is equal to 1, then sx is 1 and c is 1. Otherwise, the values of sx and c remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `val` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `c`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
