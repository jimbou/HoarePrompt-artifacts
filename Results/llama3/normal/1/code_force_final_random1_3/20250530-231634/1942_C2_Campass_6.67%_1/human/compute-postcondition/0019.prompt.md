Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is an empty list, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    if c == 1:
        sx += 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 1, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to `l[1] - l[0] - 1`, if `c` is equal to 1 then `sx` is 1 and `val` is a list containing 1, otherwise `sx` is unchanged and `val` is a list containing `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 2, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to `l[2] - l[1] - 1`. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is 2 and `val` is a list containing 1 and 1. Otherwise, `sx` is increased by 1 and `val` is a list containing `c` and `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 3, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to `l[3] - l[2] - 1`. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is either 3 or increased by 2, `val` is either a list containing 1, 1 and `c` or a list containing `c`, `c` and `c`. If `c` is not equal to 1, then `sx` is either 2 or increased by 1, `val` is either a list containing 1, 1 and `c` or a list containing `c`, `c` and `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
