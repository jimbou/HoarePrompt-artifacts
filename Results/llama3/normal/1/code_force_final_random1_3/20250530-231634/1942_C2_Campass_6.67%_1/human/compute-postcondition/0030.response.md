Postcondition: ***t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, val is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to the second element in the list val // 2. If y is less than c, sx is increased by 2y. Otherwise, sx is increased by the second element in the list val and y is decreased by the second element in the list val // 2. If y is less than the second element in the list val // 2, sx is increased by 2y.***
