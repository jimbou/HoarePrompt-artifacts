Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times (i // 2), `sx` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list l minus 1, where the even numbers come first and must have at least 1 element, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - x test cases, `i` is the first element in the list val, `c` is equal to i // 2. The current value of `y` is less than `c`***
