Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, sx is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value plus 2 times y, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 values of c, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the first value in the list val, c is equal to half of the first value in the list val.**

The code modifies the value of sx by adding 2 times y to its original value. The break statement does not affect any variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
