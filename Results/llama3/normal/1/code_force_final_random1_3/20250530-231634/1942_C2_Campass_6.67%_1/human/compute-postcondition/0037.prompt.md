Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is `x`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is increased by `x - 1` and `val` is a sorted list containing `x - 1` ones. Otherwise, `sx` is increased by `x - 2` and `val` is a sorted list containing `x - 2` ones and `c`, sorted by the key function that prioritizes even numbers over odd numbers and then sorts by the number itself.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the first element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to i // 2, val is a sorted list containing at least 1 element, sx is increased by i, y is decreased by c. If y is less than c, sx is increased by 2y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, val is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to the second element in the list val // 2, sx is increased by the second element in the list val, y is decreased by the second element in the list val // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer decreased by the third element in the list val, val is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to the third element in the list val // 2, sx is increased by the third element in the list val plus the third element in the list val plus y * 2 if y is less than c, otherwise sx remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
