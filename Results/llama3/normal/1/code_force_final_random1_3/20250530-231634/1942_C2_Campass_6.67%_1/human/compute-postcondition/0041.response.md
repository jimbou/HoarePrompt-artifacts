According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to the last element in the list val // 2, val is an empty list, sx is increased by the sum of all elements in the list val plus y * 2 if y is less than the last element in the list val // 2, otherwise sx remains unchanged, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and cons is printed**
