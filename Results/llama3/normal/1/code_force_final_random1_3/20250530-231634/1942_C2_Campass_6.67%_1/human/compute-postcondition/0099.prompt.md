Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is an empty list, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and stdin contains t - x test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    if c == 1:
        sx += 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c, `sx` is 0 or 1, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the difference between the second element in the list `l` and the first element in the list `l` minus 1, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, `stdin` contains t - x test cases, `i` is 1, `c` is equal to the difference between the second element in the list `l` and the first element in the list `l` minus 1. If c is equal to 1, then sx is 1 and c is 1. Otherwise, the values of sx and c remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the difference between the second element in the list `l` and the first element in the list `l` minus 1, and c, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, `stdin` contains t - x test cases, `i` is 2, `c` is equal to the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1. If c is equal to 1, then sx is 1 and c is 1. Otherwise, the values of sx and c remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the difference between the second element in the list `l` and the first element in the list `l` minus 1, the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1, and the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, `stdin` contains t - x test cases, `i` is 3, `c` is equal to the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1. If the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1 is equal to 1, then sx is either 1 or 2 and the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1 is 1. Otherwise, sx is equal to its original value plus 1 and the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1 remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
