Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times (i // 2) minus c minus c, sx is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value plus i plus i, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list l minus 1, where the even numbers come first and must have at least 2 elements, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - x test cases, i is the second element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `l`, `val`, `cons`, `stdin`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `sx` is incremented by `i` and the value of `y` is decremented by `c`.
