Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is `x`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is increased by `x - 1` and `val` is a list containing `x - 1` ones. Otherwise, `sx` is increased by `x - 2` and `val` is a list containing `x - 2` ones and `c`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`, and the value of `c` will be the difference between the last element of the list `l` and the second last element minus 1. If `c` is 1, then `sx` will be increased by `x - 1` and `val` will be a list containing `x - 1` ones. If `c` is not 1, then `sx` will be increased by `x - 2` and `val` will be a list containing `x - 2` ones and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `y`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
