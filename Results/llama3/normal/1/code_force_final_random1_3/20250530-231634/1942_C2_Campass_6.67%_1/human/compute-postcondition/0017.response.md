Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 3, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to `l[3] - l[2] - 1`. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is either 3 or increased by 2, `val` is either a list containing 1 and 1 or a list containing `c` and `c`. If `c` is not equal to 1, then `sx` is either 2 or increased by 1, `val` is either a list containing 1 and 1 or a list containing `c` and `c`.***
