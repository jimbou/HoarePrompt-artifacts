Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `sx` is an integer greater than or equal to `i`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a sorted list containing `x - 2` values of `c`, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, `i` is the second value in the list `val`, `c` is equal to half of the second value in the list `val`, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the second value in the list `val`.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be half of the second value in the list `val`, which is also equal to `i // 2`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
