Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is an empty list, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, `cons` has been printed, `i` is 1, and the current value of `c` is 1, which means the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` is 2.**
