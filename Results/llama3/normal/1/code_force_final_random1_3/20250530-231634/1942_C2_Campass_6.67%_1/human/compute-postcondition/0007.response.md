Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 1, and `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list. If `c` is equal to 1, which is equal to `l[1] - l[0] - 1`, then `sx` is 1 and `val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `sx` and `val` remain unchanged.***
