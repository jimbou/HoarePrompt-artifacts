Postcondition: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 1, and the current value of `c` is 1, which is equal to `l[1] - l[0] - 1`.**
