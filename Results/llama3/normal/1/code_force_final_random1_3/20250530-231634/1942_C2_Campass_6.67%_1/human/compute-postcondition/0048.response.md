Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the value of `c`, `cons` has been printed. If the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` is 2, then `sx` is 1 and `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 1`. Otherwise, `sx` is 0 and `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been appended to the list `val`, which was previously empty. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `sx` and `cons` still hold based on the difference between the second and first elements of list `l`.
