The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list val, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list val.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, val has at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element in the list.
State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the second element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to i // 2, val is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, sx is increased by i, y is decreased by c. If y is less than c, sx is increased by 2y.**
