Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c, `sx` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list l minus 1, where the even numbers come first, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - x test cases, `i` is equal to x, `c` is equal to the difference between the last element in the list l and the second last element in the list l minus 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times (i // 2) minus c, sx is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value plus i, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list l minus 1, where the even numbers come first and must have at least 1 element, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - x test cases, i is the first element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2. If y is less than c, sx is increased by 2 times y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times (i // 2) minus c minus c, sx is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value plus i plus i, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list l minus 1, where the even numbers come first and must have at least 2 elements, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - x test cases, i is the second element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times (i // 2) minus c minus c minus c, sx is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value plus i plus i plus i, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list l minus 1, where the even numbers come first and must have at least 3 elements, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, c is equal to i // 2, i is the third element in the list val, stdin contains t - x test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
