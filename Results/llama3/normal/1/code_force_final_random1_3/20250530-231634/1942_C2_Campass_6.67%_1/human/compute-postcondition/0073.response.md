Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus `c`, `sx` is an integer greater than or equal to `i` and equal to its original value plus 2 times the value of `y` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` remains unchanged, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a sorted list containing `x - 1` values of `c`, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, `i` is the third value in the list `val`, `c` is equal to half of the third value in the list `val`, and `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be half of the third value in the list `val`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `c` is now equal to `i // 2`, where `i` is the third value in the list `val`.
