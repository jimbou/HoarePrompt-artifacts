Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is an empty list, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, `stdin` contains t - x test cases, `i` is 1, `c` is equal to the difference between the second element in the list `l` and the first element in the list `l` minus 1. If c is equal to 1, then sx is 1 and c is 1. Otherwise, the values of sx and c remain unchanged.***
