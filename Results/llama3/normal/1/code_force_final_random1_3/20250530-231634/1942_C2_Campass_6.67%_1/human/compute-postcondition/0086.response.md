Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times 1, `sx` is 1, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is an empty list, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + 1 - 2, `stdin` contains t - x test cases, `i` is 1, `c` is equal to 1**

The code increments the value of `sx` by 1, so `sx` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is the same as the initial state, except for the updated value of `sx`.
