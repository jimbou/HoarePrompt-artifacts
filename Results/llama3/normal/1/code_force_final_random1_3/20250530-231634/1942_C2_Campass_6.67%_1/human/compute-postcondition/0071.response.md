Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus c, sx is an integer greater than or equal to i and equal to its original value plus 2 times the value of y if y is less than c, otherwise sx remains unchanged, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is a sorted list containing x - 2 values of c, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the second value in the list val, c is equal to half of the second value in the list val, and stdin contains t - 2 test cases.**

The code modifies the values of sx and y. The first line increments sx by the value of i, which is the second value in the list val. The second line decrements y by the value of c, which is half of the second value in the list val. The other variables remain unchanged.
