Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the difference between the second element in the list `l` and the first element in the list `l` minus 1, and the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, `stdin` contains t - x test cases, `i` is 3, `c` is equal to the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1. If the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1 is equal to 1, then sx is 1 and the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1 is 1. Otherwise, the values of sx and the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1 remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be the difference between the third element in the list `l` and the second element in the list `l` minus 1. The value of `y` has also been updated to be its original value minus (x - 1) times the new value of `c`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
