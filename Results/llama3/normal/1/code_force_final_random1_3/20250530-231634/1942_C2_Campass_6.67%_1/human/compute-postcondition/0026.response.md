Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the first element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to i // 2, val is a sorted list containing at least 1 element, sx is increased by i, y is decreased by c. If y is less than c, sx is increased by 2y.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `i`, `l`, `c`, and `val` remain unchanged. The value of `y` is decreased by `c`, and the value of `sx` is increased by `i`. Additionally, if `y` is less than `c`, the value of `sx` is further increased by `2y`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, which is `t - 1`.
