Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 1, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to `l[1] - l[0] - 1`, if `c` is equal to 1 then `sx` is 1 and `val` is a list containing 1, otherwise `sx` is unchanged and `val` is a list containing `c`.**

In this output state, the value of `c` is appended to the list `val`. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is set to 1 and `val` contains the value 1. Otherwise, `sx` remains unchanged and `val` contains the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.
