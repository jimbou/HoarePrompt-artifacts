Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the values of `c` and `c` which is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, `cons` has been printed, `i` is 2, `c` is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`. If `c` equals 1, then `sx` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the value of `c` appended to the list `val`. The value of `c` is calculated as `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, and if it equals 1, then `sx` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
