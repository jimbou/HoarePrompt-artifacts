The code prints the value of `cons`, which is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`. 

Since `sx` is increased by the sum of all elements in the list `val` plus `y * 2` if `y` is less than the last element in the list `val // 2`, otherwise `sx` remains unchanged, and `val` is an empty list, `sx` remains unchanged.

Therefore, `cons` is equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x - 2`.

Output: **the minimum of n - 2 and x - 2**
