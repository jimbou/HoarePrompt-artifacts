Postcondition: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is the first element in the list `val`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to `i // 2`, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 1 element, `sx` is increased by `x - 1` or `x - 2. The current value of `y` is less than `c`.**
