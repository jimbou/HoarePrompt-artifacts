The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and `x` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 3, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the values of `c` and `c` which is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, `cons` has been printed, `i` is 3, `c` is `l[2] - l[1] - 1**
