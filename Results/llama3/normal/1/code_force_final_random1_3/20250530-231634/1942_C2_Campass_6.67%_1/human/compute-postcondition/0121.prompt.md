Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4)
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the last element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to the last element in the list val // 2, val is an empty list, sx is increased by the sum of all elements in the list val plus y * 2 if y is less than the last element in the list val // 2, otherwise sx remains unchanged, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and cons is printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c, sx is an integer greater than or equal to i and equal to its original value plus 2 times the value of y if y is less than c, otherwise sx remains unchanged, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is an empty list, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and stdin contains t - (x - 1) test cases, and cons is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to its original value minus (x - 1) times c minus the sum of all elements in val divided by 2, sx is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is an empty list, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - x test cases, i is the last element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2, and the value of cons which is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
