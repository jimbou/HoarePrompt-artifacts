Postcondition: ***t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer decreased by the third element in the list val // 2, val is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list val, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, c is equal to the third element in the list val // 2. If y is less than c, sx is increased by the third element in the list val plus y * 2. Otherwise, sx remains unchanged.***
