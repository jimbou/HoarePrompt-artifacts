Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 2, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `c` is equal to `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, if `c` is equal to 1 then `sx` is 2 and `val` is a list containing 1, otherwise `sx` is increased by 1 and `val` is a list containing `c`.**

In this output state, the value of `sx` has been incremented by 1. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is now 2, and `val` is still a list containing 1. If `c` is not equal to 1, then `sx` has been increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified, and `val` is still a list containing `c`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
