Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, followed by n plus the first integer in the list, val is an empty list, cons is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and cons is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    if c == 1:
        sx += 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the value of `c`, `cons` has been printed. If the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` is 2, then `sx` is 1 and `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 1`. Otherwise, `sx` is 0 and `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the values of `c` and `c` which is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, `cons` has been printed, `i` is 2, `c` is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`. If `c` equals 1, then `sx` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 3, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is a list containing the values of `c` and `c` which is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, and `c` which is `l[3] - l[2] - 1`, `cons` has been printed, `i` is 3, `c` is `l[3] - l[2] - 1`. If `c` equals 1, `sx` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
