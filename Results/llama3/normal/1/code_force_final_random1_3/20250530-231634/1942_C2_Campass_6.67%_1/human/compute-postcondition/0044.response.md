Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, followed by `n` plus the first integer in the list, `val` is an empty list, `cons` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, `cons` is printed, `i` is 1, `c` is equal to `l[1] - l[0] - 1`**

In this output state, the value of `c` is calculated as the difference between the second element of the list `l` and the first element of the list `l`, minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
