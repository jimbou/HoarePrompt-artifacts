Postcondition: ***n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing n lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all n lines, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all n lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in all n lines, points is a list of two integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is either 0 or 10 or 11, i is n-1, line is the nth line of input, ind is len(line)-1, t must be greater than 1, time is 1, obj is the first string in comand, com is the second string in comand, stdin has no lines of input, pos is the value of elements[obj], nxt is a tuple containing the sum of pos[0] and mov[com][0], and the sum of pos[1] and mov[com][1]. If obj is '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt), then player is obj if obj is a player, otherwise player is the value at grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]], and this is printed: "1 [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, if com is 'T', then allPlayers[obj] is False and points is updated to [0, 11] if the goal is in the position pos. If com is not 'T', then elements[obj] is updated to nxt if obj is a player.***
