Postcondition: ***`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (`i`, `ind`) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all `n` lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all `n` lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (`i`, `ind`) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in all `n` lines, `points` is a list of two integers where the first integer is either 0 or 10 and the second integer is either 0 or 10, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is the nth line of input, `ind` is `len(line)-1`, `t` must be greater than 2, `time` is 2, `obj` is the first string in `comand`, `com` is the second string in `comand`, `comand` is a list of strings read from stdin, `stdin` has no lines of input, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of `pos[0]` and `mov[com][0]`, and the sum of `pos[1]` and `mov[com][1]. If `obj` is '.B' and is a player at position `nxt`, or if `obj` is a player and '.B' is at position `nxt`, then the player is eliminated and "2 [player] ELIMINATED" is printed. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then `obj` is no longer a player. If `com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, then `obj` moves to position `nxt`. If a goal is scored at position `pos`, then the points are updated and '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' is printed.***
