The code prints a string indicating the time and the team that scored a goal. The time is represented by the variable `time`, which is 1. The team is represented by the variable `team`, which is a boolean value indicating whether the goal is in the position `pos`. The string `GoalName[team]` will be either 'A' or 'B' depending on the value of `team`.

Output: **1 A GOAL (if team is True) or 1 B GOAL (if team is False)**
