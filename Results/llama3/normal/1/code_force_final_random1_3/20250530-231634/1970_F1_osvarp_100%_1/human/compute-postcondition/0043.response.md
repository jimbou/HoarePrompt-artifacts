Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, 0), and line[ind]: (1, 1) since line[ind] is the second character of the second line of input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for the current player and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 1, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the second line of input that must have at least 2 characters, `ind` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `i`, `stdin`, and `line` remain the same as in the initial state. The `elements` dictionary has been updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is the second character of the second line of input and the value is (1, 1).
