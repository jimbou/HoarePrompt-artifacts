Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing three lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all three lines and line[ind]: (1, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in the second and third lines of input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in the second and third lines of input and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all three lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in the second and third lines of input, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 2, stdin has no lines of input, `line` is the third line of input that must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0. The current value of `line[ind]` is not '..' and elements[line[ind]] is (2,0).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `elements` dictionary has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is the current value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(2, 0)`. This is because the code `elements[line[ind]] = i, ind` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) and `ind` (which is 0) to the key `line[ind]` in the `elements` dictionary.
