Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a single key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, goal is a list of two empty lists, points is a list of two zeros, i is 0, stdin has one less line of input.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (0, 0) if `line[ind]` is not '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `line[ind]`: False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element (i, ind). Otherwise, `goal` is a list of two empty lists if `line[ind]` is '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1), `line[ind]`: (0, 0) if `line[ind]` is not '..' and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `line[ind]`: False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element (i, ind). Otherwise, `goal` is a list of two empty lists if `line[ind]` is '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` must have at least 2 characters, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not, and `goal[tmp]` has an additional element (i, ind). If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1), `line[ind]`: (0, 0) if `line[ind]` is not '..' and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `line[ind]`: True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element (i, ind) if `line[ind]` is a player and two elements (i, ind) and (i, ind) otherwise. Otherwise, `goal` is a list of two empty lists if `line[ind]` is '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` must have at least 3 characters, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not, and `goal[tmp]` has an additional element (i, ind). If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
