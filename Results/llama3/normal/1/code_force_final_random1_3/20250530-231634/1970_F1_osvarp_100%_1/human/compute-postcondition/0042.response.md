The only variable in the loop head is variable  ind, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and `line`. If `ind` is less than the length of `line`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0, `line` has at least 1 character. For the loop to execute again `ind` must be 1.
State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, 0), `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for the current player and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 1, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the second line of input that must have at least 2 characters, `ind` is 1**
