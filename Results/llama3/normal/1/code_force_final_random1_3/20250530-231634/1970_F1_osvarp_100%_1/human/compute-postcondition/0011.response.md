Postcondition: ***`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element (i, ind). Otherwise, `goal` is a list of two empty lists.***
