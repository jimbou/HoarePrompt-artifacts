Postcondition: ***`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all `n` lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all `n` lines and `obj` is True, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in all `n` lines, `points` is a list of two integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is either 0 or 10, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is the `n`th line of input, `ind` is `len(line)-1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first string in `comand`, `com` is the second string in `comand`, and `comand` is a list of exactly 3 strings. If `el` is '.Q', then `obj` is True. If `el` is not '.Q', then `points` is a list of two integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is either 0 or 10, and if `el` is '.S', then `team` is 0 and "0 [GoalName[0]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH" is printed.***
