State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G'. Otherwise, `goal` is a list of two empty lists if all `line[ind]` are '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 1, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` must have at least `len(line)` characters, `ind` is `len(line)-1**
