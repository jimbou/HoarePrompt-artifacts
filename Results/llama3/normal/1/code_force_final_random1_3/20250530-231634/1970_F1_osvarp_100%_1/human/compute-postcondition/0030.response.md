Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines, points is a list of two zeros, i is 1, stdin has no lines of input, line is the second line of input, ind is len(line)-1.**

The code reads a second line of input from stdin and appends it to the grid list. This means that grid now contains two lines of input. The elements dictionary is updated to include key-value pairs for all non-'..' elements in both lines. The allPlayers dictionary is also updated to include key-value pairs for all player elements in both lines. The goal list is updated to include elements (i, ind) for all 'G' elements in both lines. The points list remains unchanged. The value of i remains 1. Stdin now has no lines of input. The value of line is updated to the second line of input, and the value of ind is updated to len(line)-1.
