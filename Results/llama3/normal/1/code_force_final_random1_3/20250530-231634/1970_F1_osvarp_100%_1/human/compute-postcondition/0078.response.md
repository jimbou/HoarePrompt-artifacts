The only variable in the loop head is variable  ind, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and `line`. If `ind` is less than `len(line)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1, `line` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `ind` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing three lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all three lines and line[ind]: (1, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in the second and third lines of input and line[ind]: (2, 1) for the third line, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in the second and third lines of input and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all three lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in the second and third lines of input, points is a list of two zeros, i is 2, stdin has no lines of input, line is the third line of input that must have at least 2 elements, ind is 2**
