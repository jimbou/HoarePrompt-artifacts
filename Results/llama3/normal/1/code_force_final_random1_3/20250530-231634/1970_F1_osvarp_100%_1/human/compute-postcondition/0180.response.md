Based on the precondition, the `points` list contains two integers where the first integer is either 0 or a multiple of 10 and the second integer is either 0 or a multiple of 10.

When the print statement is executed, it will print the string 'FINAL SCORE: ' followed by the two integers in the `points` list, separated by a space.

Since the exact values of the integers in the `points` list are not specified, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the final score in the format 'FINAL SCORE: x y', where x and y are the two integers in the `points` list.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] is the first integer in the points list and points[1] is the second integer in the points list)**
