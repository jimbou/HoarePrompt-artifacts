Postcondition: ***`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all `n` lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: False for all players in all `n` lines and True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all `n` lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in all `n` lines, `points` is a list of two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, otherwise `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is the nth line of input, `ind` is `len(line)-1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list of strings from the next line of input from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of `pos[0]` and `mov[com][0]` and the sum of `pos[1]` and `mov[com][1]`. If `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is False and `points` is updated accordingly. If `com` is not 'T', then either `obj` is not '.B' or it is '.B' but `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False. Also, either `obj` is not a player or it is a player but `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. If `obj` is a player, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.***
