Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all `n` lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: False for all players in all `n` lines and True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all `n` lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in all `n` lines, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is the `n`th line of input, `ind` is `len(line)-1`, `t` is an integer, and `stdin` has one less line of input.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all `n` lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all `n` lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in all `n` lines, `points` is a list of two integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is either 0 or 10, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is the `n`th line of input, `ind` is `len(line)-1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list of strings from the next line of input from stdin, and `stdin` has no lines of input. If `len(comand)` is 3, then `obj` is the first string in `comand`, `com` is the second string in `comand`, and `comand` is a list of exactly 3 strings. If `el` is '.Q', then `obj` is True. If `el` is not '.Q', then `points` is a list of two integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is either 0 or 10, and if `el` is '.S', then `team` is 0 and "0 [GoalName[0]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH" is printed. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of `pos[0]` and `mov[com][0]` and the sum of `pos[1]` and `mov[com][1]`. If `obj` is '.B', then if `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or `isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then `player` is either `obj` if `obj` is a player or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is not a player but `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, and this is printed: "0 [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is False and `points` is updated accordingly. If `com` is not 'T', then either `obj` is not '.B' or it is '.B' but `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False. Also, either `obj` is not a player or it is a player but `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. If `obj` is a player, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all `n` lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all `n` lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in all `n` lines, `points` is a list of two integers where the first integer is either 0 or 10 and the second integer is either 0 or 10, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is the `n`th line of input, `ind` is `len(line)-1`, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, `obj` is the first string in `comand`, `com` is the second string in `comand`, `stdin` has no lines of input. If `comand` has 3 elements, then if the third element is '.Q', `allPlayers` is updated to set `obj` to True. If the third element is '.S', then `points` is updated to [10, points[1]], `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' otherwise 0, and "1 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH" is printed. If `comand` has less than 3 elements, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` if `obj` is a player. Otherwise, `elements[obj]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all `n` lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all `n` lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in all `n` lines, `points` is a list of two integers where the first integer is either 0 or 10 and the second integer is either 0 or 10, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is the `n`th line of input, `ind` is `len(line)-1`, `t` must be greater than 2, `time` is 2, `obj` is the first string in `comand`, `com` is the second string in `comand`, `comand` is a list of strings read from stdin, `stdin` has no lines of input. If `len(comand)` is 3, then `allPlayers[obj]` is True if `el` is '.Q', and if `el` is '.S', then `points` is updated to [10 or 20, 0 or 10], `team` is determined based on `obj[0]` and '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' is printed. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of `pos[0]` and `mov[com][0]`, and the sum of `pos[1]` and `mov[com][1]. If `obj` is '.B' then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
