Postcondition: ***n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing n lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all n lines, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in all n lines and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all n lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in all n lines, points is a list of two zeros, i is n-1, line is the nth line of input, ind is len(line)-1, t must be greater than 0, time is 0, comand is a list of strings from the next line of input from stdin, obj is the first element of comand, com is the second element of comand, pos is the value of elements[obj], and nxt is a tuple containing the sum of pos[0] and mov[com][0] and the sum of pos[1] and mov[com][1]. Either obj is not '.B' or it is '.B' but isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) is False. Also, either obj is not a player or it is a player but elements['.B'] is not equal to nxt.***
