Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, 0), and line[ind]: (1, 1) since line[ind] is the second character of the second line of input, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for the current player and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines and the second list contains an additional element (1, 1), points is a list of two zeros, i is 1, stdin has no lines of input, line is the second line of input that must have at least 2 characters, ind is 1**

The code block modifies the `goal` variable by appending a new element to the second list. The first line checks if the first character of the second line of input is 'B', and if so, sets `tmp` to 0, otherwise sets it to 1. The second line appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the `tmp`-th list in `goal`. Since `i` is 1 and `ind` is 1, and `line[ind][0]` is not 'B' (because `line[ind]` is the second character of the second line of input), `tmp` is set to 1. Therefore, the tuple `(1, 1)` is appended to the second list in `goal`.
