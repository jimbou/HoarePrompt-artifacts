Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (0, 0), `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `line[ind]`: False, `goal` is a list of two empty lists, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. The current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'. The current value of `line[ind]` is a player.**

In this output state, the only change is that `allPlayers` now has a new key-value pair where the key is the current value of `line[ind]` (which is a player) and the value is False. All other variables remain unchanged.
