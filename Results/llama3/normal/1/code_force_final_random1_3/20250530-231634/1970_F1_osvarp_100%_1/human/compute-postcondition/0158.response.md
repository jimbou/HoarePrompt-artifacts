The code prints a formatted string indicating the time and the team that catches the Golden Snitch. The time is 2, and the team is determined by the first character of the string `obj`. If the first character of `obj` is 'B', the team is 1; otherwise, it is 0.

Output: **2 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where GoalName[team] is either GoalName[0] or GoalName[1] depending on the value of team)**
