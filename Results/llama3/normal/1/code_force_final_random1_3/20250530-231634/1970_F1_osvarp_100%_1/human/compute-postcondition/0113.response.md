The code prints a string in the format '%d %s GOAL' where %d is replaced by the value of `time` and %s is replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]`. 

Since `time` is 0, the first part of the string will be '0'. 

The value of `team` is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)`. However, the exact implementation of this function is not provided. 

Assuming that `goalIn(pos)` returns a valid index for the `GoalName` list, the second part of the string will be the value of `GoalName[team]`. 

Since the exact value of `team` and the contents of the `GoalName` list are not provided, we can't determine the exact string that will be printed. 

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string in the format '0 [GoalName] GOAL' where [GoalName] is the name of the goal determined by the `goalIn(pos)` function.

Output: **0 [GoalName] GOAL (where [GoalName] is the name of the goal determined by the goalIn(pos) function)**
