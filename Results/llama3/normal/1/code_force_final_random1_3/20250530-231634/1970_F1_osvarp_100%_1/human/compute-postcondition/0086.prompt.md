Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and m are odd integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99, grid is an empty list, elements is a dictionary with a single key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, goal is a list of two empty lists, points is a list of two zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G'. Otherwise, `goal` is a list of two empty lists if all `line[ind]` are '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` must have at least `len(line)` characters, `ind` is `len(line)-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: 
`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in the second line of input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in the second line of input and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in the second line of input, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 1, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the second line of input, `ind` is len(line)-1.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates over the characters in the second line of input, and for each character, it updates the `elements` dictionary, the `allPlayers` dictionary, and the `goal` list. The `elements` dictionary now contains key-value pairs for all characters in the second line of input that are not '..', the `allPlayers` dictionary now marks all players in the second line of input as False, and the `goal` list now contains elements for all characters in the second line of input that are 'G'. The `i` variable remains 1, and the `ind` variable is now equal to the length of the second line of input minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing three lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all three lines and line[ind]: (1, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in the second and third lines of input and line[ind]: (2, ind) for the third line, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in the second and third lines of input and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all three lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in the second and third lines of input, points is a list of two zeros, i is 2, stdin has no lines of input, line is the third line of input, ind is len(line)-1. If line[ind] is not '..', then allPlayers[line[ind]] is False if line[ind] is a player, and the goal list contains (2, ind) if line[ind][1] is 'G'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
