Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with two key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (0, 0), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element (i, ind), points is a list of two zeros, i is 0, stdin has one less line of input, line must have at least 1 character, ind is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `points`, `i`, `stdin`, `line`, and `ind` remain unchanged. The only modification is in the `goal` list, where the second list now contains the tuple `(i, ind)` because the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G'.
