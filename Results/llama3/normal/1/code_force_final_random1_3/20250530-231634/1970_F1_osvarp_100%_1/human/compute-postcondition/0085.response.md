Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing three lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all three lines and line[ind]: (1, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in the second and third lines of input and line[ind]: (2, ind) for the third line, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in the second and third lines of input and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all three lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in the second and third lines of input, points is a list of two zeros, i is 2, stdin has no lines of input, line is the third line of input, ind is len(line)-1. If line[ind] is not '..', then allPlayers[line[ind]] is False if line[ind] is a player, and the goal list contains (2, ind) if line[ind][1] is 'G'.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the following changes:

- The `elements` dictionary now contains key-value pairs for all non-'..' elements in the third line of input, with the value being the index of the element in the line.
- The `allPlayers` dictionary now contains key-value pairs for all players in the second and third lines of input, with the value being False.
- The `goal` list now contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all non-'..' elements in the second and third lines of input that are 'G', with the value being the index of the element in the line.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
