Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing n lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all n lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all n lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in all n lines, `points` is a list of two integers where the first integer is either 0 or 10 and the second integer is either 0 or 10, `i` is n-1, `line` is the nth line of input, `ind` is len(line)-1, `t` must be greater than 2, `time` is 2, `obj` is the first string in comand, `com` is the second string in comand, `comand` is a list of strings read from stdin, `stdin` has no lines of input, `pos` is the value of elements[obj], `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of pos[0] and mov[com][0], and the sum of pos[1] and mov[com][1], `player` is obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is the element at position nxt in grid.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `player` which is assigned the value of `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise it is the element at position `nxt` in `grid`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
