Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing n lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all n lines, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in all n lines and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all n lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in all n lines, points is a list of two integers where the first integer is 0 and the second integer is 10, i is n-1, line is the nth line of input, ind is len(line)-1, t must be greater than 0, time is 0, obj is the first string in comand, com is the second string in comand, el is '.S', comand is a list of exactly 3 strings, and team is 0.**

The code assigns the value of 1 to `team` if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise, it assigns 0 to `team`. Since `el` is '.S', `obj` is not 'B', so `team` becomes 0. The second line increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Since `team` is 0, `points[0]` becomes 10. No other variables are affected.
