Functionality: **This function simulates a game where players move around a grid and score points by catching the golden snitch or scoring goals. The game state is initialized by reading input from stdin, which includes the grid size, grid layout, and player positions. The function then processes a series of commands, which can be either movement commands or special commands to catch the golden snitch or score goals. The function updates the game state accordingly and prints out messages to indicate player eliminations, goals, and golden snitch catches. Finally, the function prints out the final score.**
