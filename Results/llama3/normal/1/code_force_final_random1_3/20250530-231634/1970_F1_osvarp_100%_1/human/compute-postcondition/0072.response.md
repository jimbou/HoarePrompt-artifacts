Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing three lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all three lines and line[ind]: (1, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in the second and third lines of input and line[ind]: (2, 1) for the third line, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in the second and third lines of input and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all three lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in the second and third lines of input, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 2, stdin has no lines of input, `line` is the third line of input that must have at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False if `line[ind]` is a player, and the `goal` list contains (2,1) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G'.**

In this output state, the value of `elements[line[ind]]` has been updated to `(i, ind)`, which is `(2, 1)` since `i` is 2 and `ind` is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
