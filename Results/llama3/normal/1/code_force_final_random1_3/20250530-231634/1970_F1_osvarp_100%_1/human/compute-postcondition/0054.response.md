Postcondition: ***`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, 0), and line[ind]: (1, 1) if the second character of the second line of input is not '..', and line[ind]: (1, 2) for the current player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for the current player and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, except that if the second character of the second line of input is a player, it is now False, and the value of line[ind] is now False if it is a player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines, and if the second character of the second line of input is 'G', the second list of `goal` contains an additional element (1, 1), and if the second character of the second line of input is 'G' and line[ind] is 'G', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` contains an additional element (1, ind), `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 1, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the second line of input that must have at least 3 characters, `ind` is 2.***
