To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement based on the given initial state.

1. **time**: It is given that `time` is 1.

2. **GoalName[team]**: The value of `team` depends on the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0. However, the exact value of `obj[0]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `team`. But we can infer that `team` will be either 0 or 1.

   - **GoalName**: The definition or content of `GoalName` is not provided in the initial state. However, based on the context, it seems to be a list or array with at least two elements (since `team` can be 0 or 1), where each element is presumably a name or identifier for a goal or team.

Given these considerations, the print statement will output the current `time` (which is 1) followed by the string ' CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH', and in between, it will include the `GoalName` corresponding to the `team` value.

Since we cannot determine the exact value of `team` (and thus the exact `GoalName` element) without knowing `obj[0]`, the output will be described in terms of these variables.

Output: **1 [GoalName corresponding to team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where GoalName corresponding to team is either GoalName[0] or GoalName[1] depending on whether team is 0 or 1)**
