Output State: 
`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: False for all players in all lines and True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in all lines, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the last line of input, `ind` is `len(line)-1`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False if `line[ind]` is a player, and the `goal` list contains (`n-1`, `ind`) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G'.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the state of the variables has been updated accordingly. The grid now contains all n lines of input from stdin. The elements dictionary has been populated with key-value pairs for all characters in all lines that are not '..'. The allPlayers dictionary has been updated to mark all players in all lines as False. The goal list now contains elements for all characters in all lines that are 'G'. The points list remains unchanged, with two zeros. The variable i is now equal to n-1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The stdin has no more lines of input, and the line variable is now equal to the last line of input. The ind variable is equal to the length of the last line of input minus 1. If the last character in the last line of input is not '..', then the allPlayers dictionary marks it as False if it is a player, and the goal list contains its index if it is 'G'.
