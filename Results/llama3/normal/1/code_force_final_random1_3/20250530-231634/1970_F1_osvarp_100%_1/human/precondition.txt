stdin contains the following inputs: two integers N and M, N lines of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, and an integer T followed by T lines of actions. N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99. Each pair of characters is either "..", "R0" to "R9", "B0" to "B9", "RG", "BG", or ".Q". Each action is a pair of characters representing the entity that must perform the action, followed by a description of the action ("U", "D", "L", "R", "C", or "T"), and possibly a pair of characters representing the ball caught by the player.
