Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single line of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1), `line[ind]`: (0, 0) if `line[ind]` is not '..' and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) if `line[ind]` is not '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `line[ind]`: False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element (i, ind). Otherwise, `goal` is a list of two empty lists if `line[ind]` is '..'. `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` must have at least 3 characters, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not, and `goal[tmp]` has an additional element (i, ind). If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.**

In this output state, the value of `elements[line[ind]]` has been updated to `(i, ind)`, where `i` is 0 and `ind` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
