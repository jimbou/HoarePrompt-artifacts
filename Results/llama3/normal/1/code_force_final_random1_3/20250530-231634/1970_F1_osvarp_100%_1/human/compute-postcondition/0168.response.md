The code prints a string in the format '%d %s GOAL' where %d is replaced with the value of `time` and %s is replaced with the value of `GoalName[team]`.

Based on the precondition, `time` is 2.

`team` is the result of the function `goalIn` with the argument `pos`. Since the exact implementation of `goalIn` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `team`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `team` will be either 0 or 1, corresponding to the two possible goal names.

`GoalName` is a list or dictionary containing two goal names. The exact names are not provided, but based on the context, they are likely to be 'A' and 'B'.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string in the format '2 <goal_name> GOAL', where <goal_name> is either 'A' or 'B', depending on the value of `team`.

Output: **2 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where GoalName[team] is either 'A' or 'B', depending on the value of team)**
