Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing three lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all three lines and `line[ind]`: (1, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in the second and third lines of input and `line[ind]`: (2, 1) for the third line, and `line[ind]`: (2, 2) for the third line, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: False for all players in the second and third lines of input and True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all three lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in the second and third lines of input, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 2, stdin has no lines of input, `line` is the third line of input that must have at least 2 elements, `ind` is 2, and `elements[line[ind]]` is (2, 2).**

In this output state, the value of `elements[line[ind]]` has been updated to (2, 2), which is the value of `i` and `ind` respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
