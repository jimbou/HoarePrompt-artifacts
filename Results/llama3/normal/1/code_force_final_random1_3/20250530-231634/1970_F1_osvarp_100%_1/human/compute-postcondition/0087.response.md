Output State: 
`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and `line[ind]`: (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are not '..' in all `n` lines, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs `line[ind]`: False for all players in all `n` lines and True if `line[ind]` is a player and False otherwise in all `n` lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all `line[ind]` that are 'G' in all `n` lines, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the `n`th line of input, `ind` is `len(line)-1`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False if `line[ind]` is a player, and the `goal` list contains (`n-1`, `ind`) if `line[ind][1]` is 'G'.

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all `n` iterations. The `grid` list now contains all `n` lines of input from stdin, and the `elements` dictionary contains key-value pairs for all characters in all `n` lines that are not '..'. The `allPlayers` dictionary marks all players in all `n` lines as False, and the `goal` list contains elements for all characters in all `n` lines that are 'G'. The `i` variable is now `n-1`, and the `ind` variable is equal to the length of the `n`th line of input minus 1.
