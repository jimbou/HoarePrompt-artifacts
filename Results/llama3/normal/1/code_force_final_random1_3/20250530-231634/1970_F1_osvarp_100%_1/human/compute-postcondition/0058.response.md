The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in the second line of input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in the second line of input and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in the second line of input, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 2, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the second line of input, `ind` is len(line)-1.**
