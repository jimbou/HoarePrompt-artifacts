Postcondition: ***n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing three lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all three lines and line[ind]: (1, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in the second and third lines of input and line[ind]: (2, 1) for the third line, and line[ind]: (2, 2) for the third line, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in the second and third lines of input and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all three lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in the second and third lines of input and also contains (2, 2) if line[ind][0] is not 'B', points is a list of two zeros, i is 2, stdin has no lines of input, line is the third line of input that must have at least 2 elements, ind is 2, and elements[line[ind]] is (2, 2). If line[ind][1] is 'G', then (2, 2) is added to the goal list. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
