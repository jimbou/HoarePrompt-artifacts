Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, 0), and line[ind]: (1, 1) if the second character of the second line of input is not '..', and line[ind]: (1, 2) for the current player, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for the current player and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, except that if the second character of the second line of input is a player, it is now False, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines, and if the second character of the second line of input is 'G', the second list of goal contains an additional element (1, 1), points is a list of two zeros, i is 1, stdin has no lines of input, line is the second line of input that must have at least 3 characters, ind is 2, tmp is 1 if line[ind][0] is not 'B' and 0 otherwise, and goal[tmp] contains an additional element (1, ind).**

The code snippet modifies the `goal` list by appending a new element to either the first or second list, depending on the value of `tmp`. The value of `tmp` is determined by the first character of the string at index `ind` in the `line` variable. If the character is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, it is 1. The new element appended to `goal[tmp]` is a tuple containing the value of `i` (which is 1) and the value of `ind` (which is 2).
