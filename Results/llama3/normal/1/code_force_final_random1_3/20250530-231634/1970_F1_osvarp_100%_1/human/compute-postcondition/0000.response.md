Output State: **`el` is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B', 'R', or '.', and the second character is either a digit (0-9) or 'G' or 'Q', `res` is True if the first character of `el` is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', False otherwise.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is determined by the value of `el`. If the first character of `el` is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', then `res` is True. Otherwise, `res` is False. The value of `el` remains unchanged.
