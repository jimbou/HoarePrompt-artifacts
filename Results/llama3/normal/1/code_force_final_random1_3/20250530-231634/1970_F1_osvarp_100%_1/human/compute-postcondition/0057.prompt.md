Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines, points is a list of two zeros, i is 1, stdin has no lines of input, line is the second line of input, ind is len(line)-1.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, 0), `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for the current player and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines, `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 1, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the second line of input that must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. If the character at index `ind` in the second line is a player, then the player is marked as False in the `allPlayers` dictionary. If the character at index `ind` in the second line is not a player, then the character is marked as False in the `allPlayers` dictionary and if the character is 'G', it is added to the `goal` list. If the character at index `ind` in the second line is '..', then no changes are made to the `allPlayers` dictionary or the `goal` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, 0), and line[ind]: (1, 1) if the second character of the second line of input is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for the current player and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, except that if the second character of the second line of input is a player, it is now False, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines, and if the second character of the second line of input is 'G', the second list of `goal` contains an additional element (1, 1), `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 1, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the second line of input that must have at least 2 characters, `ind` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lines of input from stdin, `elements` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in both lines and line[ind]: (1, 0), and line[ind]: (1, 1) if the second character of the second line of input is not '..', and line[ind]: (1, 2) for the current player if line[ind] is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for the current player and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in both lines, except that if the second character of the second line of input is a player, it is now False, and the value of line[ind] is now False if it is a player and line[ind] is not '..', `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in both lines, and if the second character of the second line of input is 'G', the second list of `goal` contains an additional element (1, 1), and if the second character of the second line of input is 'G' and line[ind] is 'G' and line[ind] is not '..', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` contains an additional element (1, ind), `points` is a list of two zeros, `i` is 1, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` is the second line of input that must have at least 3 characters, `ind` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
