Output State: **n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is an odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing three lines of input from stdin, elements is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs '.B': (-1, -1) and line[ind]: (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in all three lines and line[ind]: (1, ind) for all line[ind] that are not '..' in the second and third lines of input, allPlayers is a dictionary with a number of key-value pairs line[ind]: False for all players in the second and third lines of input and True if line[ind] is a player and False otherwise in all three lines, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains a number of elements (i, ind) for all line[ind] that are 'G' in the second and third lines of input, points is a list of two zeros, i is 2, stdin has no lines of input, line is the third line of input, ind is len(line)-1.**

In this output state, the code has added a new line of input to the grid, updated the elements dictionary to include the new line, updated the allPlayers dictionary to include the new line, and updated the goal list to include the new line. The values of n, m, points, and i remain unchanged. The stdin has no lines of input, and the line and ind variables have been updated to reflect the new line of input.
