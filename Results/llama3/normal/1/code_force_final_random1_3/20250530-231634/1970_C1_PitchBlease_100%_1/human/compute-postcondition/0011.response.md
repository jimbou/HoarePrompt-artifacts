Output State: **The program either returns the distance value associated with the target node if it is found in the queue, or continues executing with the updated queue, visited set, and current node, if the target node is not found and queue must not be empty, where current is the node dequeued from the front of the queue and dist is the distance value associated with the dequeued node.**

In natural language, the code dequeues a node and its associated distance value from the front of the queue. If the dequeued node is the target node, the program returns the distance value. If the dequeued node is not the target node and the queue is not empty, the program continues executing with the updated queue, visited set, and current node.
