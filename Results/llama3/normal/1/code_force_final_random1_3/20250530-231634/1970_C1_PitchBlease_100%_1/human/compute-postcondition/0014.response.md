Output State: **queue is an empty deque, visited is a set containing all nodes in the tree, and either the function has returned the distance to the target node or the target node is not reachable from the start node.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the queue will be empty because all nodes in the tree will have been visited and processed. The visited set will contain all nodes in the tree, indicating that every node has been explored. If the target node is reachable from the start node, the function will have returned the distance to the target node. If the target node is not reachable from the start node, the function will not return any value, indicating that the target node cannot be reached from the start node.
