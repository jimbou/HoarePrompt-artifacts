Output State: **`current` is assigned the first tuple from the `queue`, `dist` is assigned the second value of the first tuple from the `queue`, `queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple less than before, `visited` is a set containing `start`, and `current` is not equal to `target`**

In this output state, the value of `current` is updated to the first tuple from the `queue`, and the value of `dist` is updated to the second value of the first tuple from the `queue`. The `queue` is now one tuple shorter than before. The `visited` set still contains `start`, and the condition that `current` is not equal to `target` remains valid.
