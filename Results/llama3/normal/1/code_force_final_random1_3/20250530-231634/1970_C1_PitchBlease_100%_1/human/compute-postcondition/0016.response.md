Functionality: **This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree, represented as a dictionary of neighboring nodes. It takes three parameters: the start node, the target node, and the tree structure. The function returns the distance to the target node if it is reachable from the start node, or -1 if the target node is not reachable. The function modifies the input tree by marking all visited nodes, and it returns the distance or -1 as the final state of the program.**
