Output State: **`current` is assigned the value `start`, `dist` is assigned the value 0, `queue` is a deque containing no tuples, `visited` is a set containing `start`**.

In this output state, the value of `current` is now `start`, and the value of `dist` is now 0. The `queue` is now empty since we have removed the only tuple it contained. The `visited` set still contains `start`.
