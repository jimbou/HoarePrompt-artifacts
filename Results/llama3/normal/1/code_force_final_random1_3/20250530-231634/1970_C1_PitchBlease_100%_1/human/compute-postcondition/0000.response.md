Output State: **queue is a deque containing a tuple of start and 0, visited is a set containing start**.

The code initializes a queue with a tuple containing the start node and the value 0, and a set containing the start node. The queue is used to keep track of nodes to be visited, and the set is used to keep track of nodes that have already been visited. The start node is added to both the queue and the set.
