#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is a list of pairs of integers, each pair representing an edge in the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node. The tree represented by edges has exactly two leaves and n nodes.
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is a list of pairs of integers, start is an integer representing the starting node, tree is a dictionary with all integers in edges as keys, tree[u] is a list containing all integers v such that (u, v) is in edges, tree[v] is a list containing all integers u such that (u, v) is in edges.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winner of a game based on the parity of the shortest distances from a starting node to the two leaves in a tree. The function takes an integer n, a list of edges, and a starting node as input, and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' depending on whether the distances are odd or even.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, and tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: queue is an empty deque, visited is a set containing all nodes in the tree, and either the function has returned the distance to the target node or the target node is not reachable from the start node.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree, represented as a dictionary of neighboring nodes. It takes three parameters: the start node, the target node, and the tree structure. The function returns the distance to the target node if it is reachable from the start node, or -1 if the target node is not reachable. The function modifies the input tree by marking all visited nodes, and it returns the distance or -1 as the final state of the program.
