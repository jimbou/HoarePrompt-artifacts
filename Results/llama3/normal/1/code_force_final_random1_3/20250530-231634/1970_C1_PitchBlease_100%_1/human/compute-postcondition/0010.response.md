The variable in the loop head is queue, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable queue.  If queue is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the program either returns the distance value associated with the target node if it is found in the queue, or continues executing with the updated queue, visited set, and current node, if the target node is not found. So for the loop to be executed one more time the queue must not be empty.
State: **The program either returns the distance value associated with the target node if it is found in the queue, or continues executing with the updated queue, visited set, and current node, if the target node is not found and queue must not be empty**
