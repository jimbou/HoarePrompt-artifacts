To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition that allows the loop to execute. The loop condition is `while queue:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `queue` is a deque containing a tuple of `start` and `0`.
- `visited` is a set containing `start`.

Since the loop's execution depends solely on the state of `queue`, we need to ensure that `queue` is not empty. The provided state already guarantees this because it specifies that `queue` contains a tuple of `start` and `0`, indicating it is not empty.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time, as the condition for the loop to proceed is already met by the given state.

State: **queue is a deque containing a tuple of start and 0, visited is a set containing start**
