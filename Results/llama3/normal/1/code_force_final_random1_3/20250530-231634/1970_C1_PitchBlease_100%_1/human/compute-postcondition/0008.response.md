Output State: **The program returns the second value of the first tuple from the queue, which is the distance value associated with the current node in the queue.**

In this output state, the returned value is the distance value (`dist`) that was assigned from the second element of the first tuple in the `queue`. This distance value is associated with the `current` node, which is the first tuple in the `queue`. The `queue` contains at least one tuple less than before, indicating that the first tuple has been removed and processed. The `visited` set contains the `start` node, and the `current` node is not equal to the `target` node.
