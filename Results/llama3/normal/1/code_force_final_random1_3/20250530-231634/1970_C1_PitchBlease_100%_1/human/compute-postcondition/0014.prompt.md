Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: queue is a deque containing a tuple of start and 0, visited is a set containing start
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`current` is assigned the value `start`, `dist` is assigned the value 0, `queue` is a deque containing no tuples, `visited` is a set containing `start`, and `current` is not equal to `target`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *The program either returns the distance value associated with the target node if it is found in the queue, or continues executing with the updated queue, visited set, and current node, if the target node is not found.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *The program either returns the distance value associated with the target node if it is found in the queue, or continues executing with the updated queue, visited set, and current node, if the target node is not found and queue must not be empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
