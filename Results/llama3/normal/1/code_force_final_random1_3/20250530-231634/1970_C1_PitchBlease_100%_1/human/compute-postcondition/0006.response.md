According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is a deque containing no tuples, which means it is empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `queue` must not be empty.
State: **`current` is assigned the value `start`, `dist` is assigned the value 0, `queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple, `visited` is a set containing `start`, and `current` is not equal to `target`**
