Output State: **The program returns the distance from the start to the target, which is 0.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `current` is assigned the value `start`, and `dist` is assigned the value 0. Additionally, `queue` is a deque containing no tuples, and `visited` is a set containing `start`. Since the current value of `current` is equal to `target`, it means that the target has been reached. The program returns the value of `dist`, which is 0, indicating that the distance from the start to the target is 0.
