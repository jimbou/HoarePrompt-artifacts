This function takes two lists as input, 'a' containing two integers and 'b' containing two strings. It then returns two values, each being the concatenation of an integer from 'a' and a string from 'b'. The first returned value is the concatenation of the first integer in 'a' and the first string in 'b', and the second returned value is the concatenation of the second integer in 'a' and the second string in 'b'.
