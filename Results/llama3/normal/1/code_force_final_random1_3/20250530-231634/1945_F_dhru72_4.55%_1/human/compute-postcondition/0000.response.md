Output State: **`T` is a type variable, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer (the number of mushrooms). The second line contains a list of integers (the magic powers of the mushrooms). The third line contains a permutation of integers from 1 to the number of mushrooms.**

In this output state, a type variable `T` has been defined, but it does not have any specific value. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines: the number of mushrooms, the magic powers of the mushrooms, and a permutation of integers from 1 to the number of mushrooms.
