Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where the first value is an integer, y is a list of n values where the first value is an integer, r is a list of n values where the first value is an integer, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains n-1 inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th disk, i is 1**

In this output state, the values of x, y, and r have been updated with the first set of coordinates and radius from the input. The value of i has been incremented to 1. The stdin now contains n-1 inputs, as one input has been consumed. The values of visited and coef remain unchanged.
