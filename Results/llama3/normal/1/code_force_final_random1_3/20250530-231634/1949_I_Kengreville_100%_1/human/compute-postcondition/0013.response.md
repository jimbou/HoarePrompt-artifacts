The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n values where the value at index i is True if i has been visited, otherwise False, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is 1, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is True if i has been visited, otherwise False**
