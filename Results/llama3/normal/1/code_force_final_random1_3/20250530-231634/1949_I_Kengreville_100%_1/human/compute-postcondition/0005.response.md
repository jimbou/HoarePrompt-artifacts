The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer and the third value is an integer, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer and the third value is an integer, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer and the third value is an integer, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, `stdin` contains `n-4` inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the `i`-th disk, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**
