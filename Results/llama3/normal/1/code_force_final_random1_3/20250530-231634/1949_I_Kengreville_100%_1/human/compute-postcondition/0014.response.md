Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n values where the value at index i is True if i has been visited, otherwise False, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is 1, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is True if i has been visited and bipartite is True and tot is not 0, otherwise False**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` also remain unchanged, each containing `n` integer values. The `visited` list still tracks whether each index `i` has been visited, with `True` indicating a visit and `False` otherwise. The `coef` list now has a value of 1 at index `i`, indicating that `i` has been visited.

The `stdin` input remains empty, containing 0 inputs. The value of `i` is still 1. The `tot` variable is reset to 0. The `bipartite` variable is set to `True`.

The `ok` variable is updated based on the values of `bipartite` and `tot`. If `i` has been visited (i.e., `visited[i]` is `True`) and `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, then `ok` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `ok` is set to `False`.
