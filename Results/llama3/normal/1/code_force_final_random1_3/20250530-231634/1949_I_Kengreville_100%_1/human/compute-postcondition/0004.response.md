Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer and the third value is an integer, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer and the third value is an integer, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer and the third value is an integer, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, `stdin` contains `n-3` inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the `i`-th disk, `i` is 3**.

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, and `r` at index `i` (which is 2) have been updated to the three integers from the input, representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the 2nd disk. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n-3` inputs, as one input has been consumed. The value of `i` has been incremented to 3.
