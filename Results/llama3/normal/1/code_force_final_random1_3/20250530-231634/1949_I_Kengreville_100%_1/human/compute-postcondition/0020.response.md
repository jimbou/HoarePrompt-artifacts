Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n, tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is True because any i has been visited and bipartite is True and tot is not 0.**
