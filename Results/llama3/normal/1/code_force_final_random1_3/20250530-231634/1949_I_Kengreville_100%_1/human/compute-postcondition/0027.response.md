Functionality: **Determines whether a set of disks can be colored with two colors such that no two overlapping disks have the same color. The function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of disks (n), and each subsequent line contains three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of a disk. The function then checks if it is possible to color the disks with two colors and prints 'YES' if it is possible, and 'NO' otherwise.**
