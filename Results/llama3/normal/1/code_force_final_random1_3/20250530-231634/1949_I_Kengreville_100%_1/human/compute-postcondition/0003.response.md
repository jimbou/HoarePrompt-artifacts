To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, `stdin` contains `n-2` inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the `i`-th disk, `i` is 2**
