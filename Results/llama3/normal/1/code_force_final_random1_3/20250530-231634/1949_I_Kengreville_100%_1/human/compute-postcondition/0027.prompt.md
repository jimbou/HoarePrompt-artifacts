You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: the first input is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and the next n inputs are three integers each, representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th disk. The coordinates are integers between -10^9 and 10^9, and the radius is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9.
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is True if any i has been visited and bipartite is True and tot is not 0, otherwise False.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n, tot is 0, bipartite is True. If any i has been visited and bipartite is True and tot is not 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n, tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is True because any i has been visited and bipartite is True and tot is not 0, and 'YES' is being printed

Case_2: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is False, and 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
