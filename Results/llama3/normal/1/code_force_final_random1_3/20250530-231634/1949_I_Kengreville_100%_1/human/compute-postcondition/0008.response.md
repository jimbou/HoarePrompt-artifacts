Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is False**

The code initializes three new variables: `tot` is set to 0, `bipartite` is set to True, and `ok` is set to False. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
