Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n None values, y is a list of n None values, r is a list of n None values, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains n inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th disk.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where the first value is an integer, y is a list of n values where the first value is an integer, r is a list of n values where the first value is an integer, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains n-1 inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th disk, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer and the third value is an integer, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer and the third value is an integer, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer and the third value is an integer, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, `stdin` contains `n-3` inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the `i`-th disk, `i` is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer, the third value is an integer, and the fifth value is an integer, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer, the third value is an integer, and the fifth value is an integer, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer, the third value is an integer, and the fifth value is an integer, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, `stdin` contains `n-5` inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the `i`-th disk, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
