Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n None values, y is a list of n None values, r is a list of n None values, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains n inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th disk.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned from the first input in stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. The lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` have been initialized with `n` None values each. The stdin now contains `n` inputs, each consisting of three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th disk.
