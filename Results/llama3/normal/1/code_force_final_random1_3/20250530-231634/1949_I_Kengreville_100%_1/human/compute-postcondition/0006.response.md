Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer, the third value is an integer, and the fifth value is an integer, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer, the third value is an integer, and the fifth value is an integer, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first value is an integer, the third value is an integer, and the fifth value is an integer, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, `stdin` contains `n-5` inputs: each input is three integers representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the `i`-th disk, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, and `r` at index `i` (which is 4) have been updated to the integers from the input, and the number of inputs in `stdin` has decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
