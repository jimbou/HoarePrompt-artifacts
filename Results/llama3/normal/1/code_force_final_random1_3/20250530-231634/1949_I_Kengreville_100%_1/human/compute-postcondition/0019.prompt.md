Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n values where the value at index i is True if i has been visited, otherwise False, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is 0, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is True if i has been visited, otherwise False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n values where the value at index i is True if i has been visited, otherwise False, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is 1, tot is 0, bipartite is True, if i has not been visited, ok is True if i has been visited and bipartite is True and tot is not 0, otherwise False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, x is a list of n values where all values are integers, y is a list of n values where all values are integers, r is a list of n values where all values are integers, visited is a list of n values where the value at index i is True if i has been visited, otherwise False, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1 if i has been visited, otherwise None, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is 2, tot is 0, bipartite is True, if i has not been visited, ok is True if i has been visited and bipartite is True and tot is not 0, otherwise False




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
