To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `l`, `r`, and `ops`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `ops` is a collection of pairs `(l, r)`, so for the loop to execute, `ops` must have at least one pair.
2. Since `ops` is the number of operations required to make all elements in `a` equal to `m`, it implies that `ops` is a non-empty collection of pairs.
3. `l` and `r` are indices or values that will be used in the loop body. For the loop to execute, `l` and `r` must be initialized with some values.

Considering the states before the loop starts, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `ops` must have at least one pair `(l, r)`.
* `l` and `r` are initialized with some values, which are the first pair in `ops`.

The other states, such as `n`, `a`, `s`, `m`, `stdin`, and the printed values, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer less or equal than 18, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a non-empty collection of pairs `(l, r)`, `l` and `r` are initialized with the first pair in `ops`, `stdin` is empty, and the sum of the elements in `a` which is `s` and the maximum element in `a` which is `m` are printed**
