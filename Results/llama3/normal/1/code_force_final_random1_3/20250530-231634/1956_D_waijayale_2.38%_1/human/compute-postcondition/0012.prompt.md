Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer less or equal than 18, a is a list of n non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, s is the sum of the elements in a, m is the maximum element in a, ops is the number of operations required to make all elements in a equal to m, stdin is empty, and this is printed: the sum of the elements in a which is s and the maximum element in a which is m
Code of the loop:
for l, r in ops:
    print(l + 1, r + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer less or equal than 18, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a non-empty collection of pairs `(l, r)`, `l` and `r` are initialized with the first pair in `ops`, `stdin` is empty, the sum of the elements in `a` which is `s` and the maximum element in `a` which is `m` are printed, and the value of `l + 1` and `r + 1` are printed, where `l` and `r` are the first pair in `ops`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer less or equal than 18, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a non-empty collection of pairs `(l, r)` that has at least 2 pairs, `l` and `r` are the second pair in `ops`, `stdin` is empty, the sum of the elements in `a` which is `s` and the maximum element in `a` which is `m` are printed, and the value of `l + 1` and `r + 1` are printed, where `l` and `r` are the second pair in `ops`, and the value of `l + 1` and `r + 1` are printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer less or equal than 18, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a non-empty collection of pairs `(l, r)` that has at least 1 pair, `l` and `r` are the third pair in `ops`, `stdin` is empty, and this is printed: the third pair of `ops` with both elements incremented by 1, which are `l + 1` and `r + 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
