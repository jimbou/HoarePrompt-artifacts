The only objects in the loop head are variables  `l`, `r` and collection `ops`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the collection `ops`.  If the collection `ops` has at least 2 pairs the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` has at least 1 pair, `l` and `r` are the first pair in `ops`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the collection `ops` must have at least 2 pairs and the `l` and `r` are the second pair in `ops`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer less or equal than 18, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a non-empty collection of pairs `(l, r)` that has at least 2 pairs, `l` and `r` are the second pair in `ops`, `stdin` is empty, the sum of the elements in `a` which is `s` and the maximum element in `a` which is `m` are printed, and the value of `l + 1` and `r + 1` are printed, where `l` and `r` are the second pair in `ops`**
