Output: **`n` is a positive integer less or equal than 18, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a non-empty collection of pairs `(l, r)` that has at least 1 pair, `l` and `r` are the third pair in `ops`, `stdin` is empty, and this is printed: the third pair of `ops` with both elements incremented by 1, which are `l + 1` and `r + 1`**
