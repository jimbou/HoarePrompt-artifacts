The code prints the sum of the elements in the list `a` and the maximum element in the list `a`. The sum of the elements in the list `a` is represented by the variable `s`, and the maximum element in the list `a` is represented by the variable `m`.

Since the exact values of the elements in the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `s` and `m`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the elements in the list `a` and the maximum element in the list `a`.

Output: **s (which is the sum of the elements in the list a), m (which is the maximum element in the list a)**
