Output State: **l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the integers in a from index l to r (inclusive), mx is the maximum value in a from index l to r (inclusive), and pos is the index of mx in a. The function recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r) has been called and its return value has been returned.**

In this output state, the values of l, r, a, s, mx, and pos remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the function recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r) has been called, and its return value has been returned. This means that the function has been executed with the arguments pos + 1 and r, and the result of this execution has been returned to the caller.
