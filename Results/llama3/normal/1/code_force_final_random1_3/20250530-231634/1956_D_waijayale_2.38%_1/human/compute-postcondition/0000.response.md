Output State: **n is a positive integer less or equal than 18, a is a list of n non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, s is the sum of the elements in a, m is the maximum element in a, ops is the number of operations required to make all elements in a equal to m, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was assigned the value of the first input from stdin. The list `a` now contains `n` non-negative integers, each less or equal than 10^7, which were read from the second input in stdin. The variable `s` holds the sum of all elements in `a`, `m` holds the maximum element in `a`, and `ops` holds the number of operations required to make all elements in `a` equal to `m`. Stdin is now empty as both inputs have been read.
