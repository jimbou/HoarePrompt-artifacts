Output: **`n` is a positive integer less or equal than 18, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a non-empty collection of pairs `(l, r)`, `l` and `r` are initialized with the first pair in `ops`, `stdin` is empty, the sum of the elements in `a` which is `s` and the maximum element in `a` which is `m` are printed, and the value of `l + 1` and `r + 1` are printed, where `l` and `r` are the first pair in `ops`**
