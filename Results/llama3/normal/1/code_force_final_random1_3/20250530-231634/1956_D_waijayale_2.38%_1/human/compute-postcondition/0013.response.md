Functionality: **This function reads two inputs from stdin: a positive integer n (less than or equal to 18) and a space-separated list of n non-negative integers (each less than or equal to 10^7). It then calculates the sum and maximum value of the integers in the list, and prints these values. Additionally, it prints pairs of values (l+1, r+1) for each pair (l, r) in an empty collection of pairs, although since the collection is empty, no such pairs are actually printed. The function does not modify the input list or perform any other actions beyond reading input and printing output.**
