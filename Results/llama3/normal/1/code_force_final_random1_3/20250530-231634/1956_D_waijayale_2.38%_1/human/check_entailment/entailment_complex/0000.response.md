Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer not in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and setting all elements in the range `l` to `r` to `x`.

The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`. 

`func_1` is a recursive function that modifies the list `a` and the list of operations `ops` based on the range defined by `l` and `r`. If `l` equals `r`, it checks if the element at index `l` in `a` is not zero, and if so, it appends an operation `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets the element at index `l` in `a` to zero. If `l` is less than `r`, it recursively calls itself with the range `l + 1` to `r`. If the element at index `l` in `a` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it appends an operation `(l, r)` to `ops`, sets all elements in the range `l` to `r` in `a` to `r - l + 1`, and then recursively calls itself again with the same range.

`func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers as input, calculates the sum of all integers in the list, and returns the sum along with an empty list and its length (which is 0). However, this function does not modify the input list.

`func_3` maximizes the sum of a subarray within a given list of non-negative integers. It takes two parameters, `l` and `r`, representing the start and end indices of the subarray, and modifies the original list in-place. If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the number of elements in the subarray, it sets all elements in the subarray to the length of the subarray and appends the indices to an operations list. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on the left and right halves of the subarray, centered around the maximum value in the subarray.

`func_4` reads two inputs from stdin: a positive integer `n` (less than or equal to 18) and a space-separated list of `n` non-negative integers (each less than or equal to 10^7). It then calculates the sum and maximum value of the integers in the list, and prints these values. Additionally, it prints pairs of values `(l+1, r+1)` for each pair `(l, r)` in an empty collection of pairs, although since the collection is empty, no such pairs are actually printed.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_2` does not actually perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array. It simply returns the sum of the array and an empty list of operations. This means that the program does not actually achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
