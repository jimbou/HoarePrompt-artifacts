To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for (l, r) in ops:`

The objects in the loop head are `l`, `r`, and `ops`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` collection. If `ops` has at least one more pair, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ops` has at least 2 pairs, and `l` and `r` are the second pair in `ops`.

For the loop to execute again, `ops` must have at least one more pair, and `l` and `r` must be the next pair in `ops`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer less or equal than 18, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a non-empty collection of pairs `(l, r)` that has at least 1 pair, `l` and `r` are the third pair in `ops`, `stdin` is empty**
