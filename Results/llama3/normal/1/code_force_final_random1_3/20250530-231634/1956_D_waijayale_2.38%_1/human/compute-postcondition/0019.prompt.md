You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), and a is a list of non-negative integers.
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l < r + 1 < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers where all elements from index l to r (inclusive) are r - l + 1, s is the sum of the integers in a from index l to r (inclusive) minus the original sum of the integers in a from index l to r (inclusive) plus (r - l + 1)^2, s is less than or equal to the square of the number of elements in the subarray from l to r (inclusive), ops is a list containing a tuple (l, r), i is r.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the integers in a from index l to r (inclusive), mx is the maximum value in a from index l to r (inclusive), and pos is the index of mx in a. If pos is not equal to l, the function recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1) has been called and its return value has been returned. Otherwise, no further action has been taken.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: *l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the integers in a from index l to r (inclusive), mx is the maximum value in a from index l to r (inclusive), and pos is the index of mx in a. If pos is not equal to r, the function recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r) has been called and its return value has been returned. Otherwise, no further action has been taken.
    #State: *`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, and `s` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If `s` is less than or equal to the square of the number of elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` (inclusive), all elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) are set to `r - l + 1`, `s` is updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) minus the original sum of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) plus `(r - l + 1)^2`, and `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(l, r)`. Otherwise, if the maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is not at index `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called and its return value has been returned. Otherwise, no further action has been taken.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
