Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, and `s` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If `s` is less than or equal to the square of the number of elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` (inclusive), all elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) are set to `r - l + 1`, `s` is updated to be the sum of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) minus the original sum of the integers in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) plus `(r - l + 1)^2`, and `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(l, r)`. Otherwise, if the maximum value in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is not at index `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called and its return value has been returned. Otherwise, no further action has been taken.***
