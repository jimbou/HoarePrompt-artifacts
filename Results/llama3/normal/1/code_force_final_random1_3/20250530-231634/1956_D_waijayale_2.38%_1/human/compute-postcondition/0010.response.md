The code prints the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are the third pair in the `ops` collection.

Since `l` and `r` are part of a pair in `ops`, they are integers representing the left and right indices of a range.

The `+ 1` operation is applied to both `l` and `r`, which increments their values by 1.

Therefore, the output will be the incremented values of `l` and `r`, separated by a space.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are the third pair in the ops collection, incremented by 1)**
