You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a space-separated list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer and less or equal than 18. The integers in the list are non-negative integers and less or equal than 10^7.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    #This is printed: s (which is the sum of the elements in the list a), m (which is the maximum element in the list a)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer less or equal than 18, a is a list of n non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, s is the sum of the elements in a, m is the maximum element in a, ops is an empty collection of pairs (l, r), stdin is empty, the sum of the elements in a which is s and the maximum element in a which is m are printed, and the value of l + 1 and r + 1 are printed for each pair (l, r) in ops.

```

Return Postconditions: n is a positive integer less or equal than 18, a is a list of n non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, s is the sum of the elements in a, m is the maximum element in a, ops is an empty collection of pairs (l, r), stdin is empty, the sum of the elements in a which is s and the maximum element in a which is m are printed, and the value of l + 1 and r + 1 are printed for each pair (l, r) in ops.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
