The code prints the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are the second pair in the `ops` collection.

Since `l` and `r` are the second pair in `ops`, they are non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, which is a positive integer less than or equal to 18.

Therefore, `l + 1` and `r + 1` are also non-negative integers less than or equal to 19.

Output: **[l + 1] and [r + 1] (where l and r are the second pair in the ops collection)**
