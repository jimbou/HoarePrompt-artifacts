The code prints the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are the first pair of elements in the `ops` collection.

Since `l` and `r` are initialized with the first pair in `ops`, their values are the first two elements of the first pair in `ops`.

Output: **[l+1] [r+1] (where l and r are the first pair of elements in the ops collection)**
