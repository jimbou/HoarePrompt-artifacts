This function modifies a list of non-negative integers `a` and a list of operations `ops` based on the range defined by non-negative integers `l` and `r`. If `l` equals `r`, it checks if the element at index `l` in `a` is not zero, and if so, it appends an operation `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets the element at index `l` in `a` to zero. If `l` is less than `r`, it recursively calls itself with the range `l + 1` to `r`. If the element at index `l` in `a` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it appends an operation `(l, r)` to `ops`, sets all elements in the range `l` to `r` in `a` to `r - l + 1`, and then recursively calls itself again with the same range. The function does not return any value.
