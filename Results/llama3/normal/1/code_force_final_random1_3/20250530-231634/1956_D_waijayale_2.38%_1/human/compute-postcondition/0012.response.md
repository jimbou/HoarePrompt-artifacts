Output State: **n is a positive integer less or equal than 18, a is a list of n non-negative integers less or equal than 10^7, s is the sum of the elements in a, m is the maximum element in a, ops is an empty collection of pairs (l, r), stdin is empty, the sum of the elements in a which is s and the maximum element in a which is m are printed, and the value of l + 1 and r + 1 are printed for each pair (l, r) in ops.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged. The `ops` collection is now empty, indicating that all pairs have been processed. The sum of the elements in `a` and the maximum element in `a` have been printed, and the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1` have been printed for each pair in `ops`. The `stdin` remains empty, indicating that no further input is expected.
