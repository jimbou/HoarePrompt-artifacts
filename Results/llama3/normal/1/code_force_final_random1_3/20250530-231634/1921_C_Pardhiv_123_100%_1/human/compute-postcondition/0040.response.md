Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `f` is the integer value from the first input line minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i`th and `(i-1)`th elements of `ls` and `b` minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i`th and `(i-1)`th elements of `ls` and `b`, `a` is the integer value from the first input line, `b` is the integer value from the first input line, `ls` is a list of integers from the second input line, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least `t` - 2 test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the 2nd and 1st elements of `ls` and `b` from its original value. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least `t` - 2 test cases.
