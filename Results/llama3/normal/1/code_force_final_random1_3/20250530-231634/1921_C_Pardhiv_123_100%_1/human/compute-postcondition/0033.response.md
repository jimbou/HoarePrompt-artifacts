Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is at least n, f is the integer value from the first input line minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of ls and b for all i from 1 to n, a is the integer value from the first input line, b is the integer value from the first input line, ls is a list of integers from the second input line, i is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
