The code `t = int(input(''))` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. Since the code only reads one integer from the input, the first test case is partially read. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. The first test case is partially read, and the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.**
