The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is at least 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is at least 3, `f` is the integer value from the first input line minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `ls` and `b` minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `ls` and `b`, `a` is the integer value from the first input line, `b` is the integer value from the first input line, `ls` is a list of integers from the second input line, `i` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases**
