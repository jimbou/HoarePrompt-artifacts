#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0, n is the integer value from the first input line, a is the integer value from the first input line, b is the integer value from the first input line, ls is a list of integers from the second input line, i is n, stdin is empty. If f is greater than 0, where f is the integer value from the first input line minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of ls and b for i from 1 to n, then 'YES' is printed for each test case. Otherwise, if f is less than or equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n integers in ascending order. The function calculates the value of f after subtracting the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive integers in the second line and b, for each pair of consecutive integers. If the final value of f is greater than 0, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
