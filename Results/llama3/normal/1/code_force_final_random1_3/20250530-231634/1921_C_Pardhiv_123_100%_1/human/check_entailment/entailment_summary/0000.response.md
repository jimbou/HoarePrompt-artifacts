Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the parameters for each test case (n, f, a, b), and the list of message sending moments (ls).

2. It initializes the list `ls` with a 0 at the beginning to simplify the calculation of the time differences between consecutive messages.

3. The program then iterates over the list of messages, calculating the minimum cost of sending each message. The cost is either the time difference between the current and previous message multiplied by the per-unit-time cost `a`, or the fixed cost `b` of turning the phone on and off. This is in line with the problem statement.

4. After calculating the cost for all messages, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. The program repeats this process for all test cases.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
