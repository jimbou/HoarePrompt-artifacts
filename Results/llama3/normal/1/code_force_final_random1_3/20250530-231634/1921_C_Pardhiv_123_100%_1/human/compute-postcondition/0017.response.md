Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a` * (`ls[i]` - `ls[i - 1]`) and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one line. The line contains `n` space-separated integers. If the final value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
