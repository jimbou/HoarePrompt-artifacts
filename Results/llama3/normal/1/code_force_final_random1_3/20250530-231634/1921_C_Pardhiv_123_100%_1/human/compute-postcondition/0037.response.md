According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is the integer value from the first input line, `a` is the integer value from the first input line, `b` is the integer value from the first input line, `ls` is a list of integers from the second input line, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least `t` - 2 test cases**
