The code `f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` updates the value of `f` by subtracting the minimum of two values: `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`.

Since `i` is 1, `ls[i]` is the second element of the list `ls`, and `ls[i - 1]` is the first element of the list `ls`. The value of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` is the product of `a` and the difference between the second and first elements of `ls`.

The value of `b` is an integer.

The minimum of these two values is subtracted from `f`, which is an integer.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[1] - ls[0])` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one line. The line contains `n` space-separated integers.**
