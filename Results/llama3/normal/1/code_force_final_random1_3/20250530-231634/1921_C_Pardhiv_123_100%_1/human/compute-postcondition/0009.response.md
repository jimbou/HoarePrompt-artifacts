Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer, i is n, f is an integer decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is an integer, b is an integer, ls is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one line. The line contains n space-separated integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains a positive integer, `n` remains an integer, `i` becomes equal to `n`, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `a` and `b` remain integers, `ls` remains a list of integers, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases, each with one line containing `n` space-separated integers.
