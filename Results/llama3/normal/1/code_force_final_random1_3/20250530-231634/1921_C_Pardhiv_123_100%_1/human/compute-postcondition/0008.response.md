Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 3, and the list `ls` is still a list of integers. The input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases.
