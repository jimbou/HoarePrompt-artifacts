Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone. The program iterates through each message and calculates the minimum charge consumption between turning off and on the phone and keeping it on. It subtracts this minimum charge from the initial charge and checks if the remaining charge is greater than 0 after all messages have been sent.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where the initial charge is 0 or the charge consumption per unit of time is 0. The program also correctly handles the case where the charge consumption when turned off and on sequentially is 0.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
