Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. The program iterates over each pair of consecutive messages, calculates the minimum energy consumption (either by keeping the phone on or by turning it off and on), and subtracts this value from the initial phone charge. If the final charge is greater than 0, it prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all the messages. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program handles all test cases correctly and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
