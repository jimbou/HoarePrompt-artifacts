Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is the integer value from the first input line, a is the integer value from the first input line, b is the integer value from the first input line, ls is a list of integers from the second input line, i is n, stdin contains at least t - 3 test cases. If f is greater than 0, where f is the integer value from the first input line minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of ls and b for i from 1 to n, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if f is less than or equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now a positive integer greater than 0. The values of n, a, b, ls, and i remain the same as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains at least t - 3 test cases. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' remains the same, depending on the value of f.
