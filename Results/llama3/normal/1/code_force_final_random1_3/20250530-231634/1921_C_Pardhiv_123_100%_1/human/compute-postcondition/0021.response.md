Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is at least 1, `f` is the integer value from the first input line minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `ls` and `b`, `a` is the integer value from the first input line, `b` is the integer value from the first input line, `ls` is a list of integers from the second input line, `i` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `ls` and `b` from its original value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases.
