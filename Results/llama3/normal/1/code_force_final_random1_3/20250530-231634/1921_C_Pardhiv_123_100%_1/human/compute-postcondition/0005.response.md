To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `t` is a positive integer (no change needed)
* `n` must be greater than 0 (no change needed)
* `i` is 1 (needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration)
* `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[1] - ls[0])` and `b` (no change needed, as it's not part of the loop head)
* `a` is an integer (no change needed)
* `b` is an integer (no change needed)
* `ls` is a list of integers (no change needed)
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases (no change needed)

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[1] - ls[0])` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases**
