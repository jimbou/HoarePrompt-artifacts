Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is at least 2, `f` is the integer value from the first input line minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `ls` and `b` minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `ls` and `b`, `a` is the integer value from the first input line, `b` is the integer value from the first input line, `ls` is a list of integers from the second input line, `i` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` is updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `ls` and `b` from its previous value. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same.
