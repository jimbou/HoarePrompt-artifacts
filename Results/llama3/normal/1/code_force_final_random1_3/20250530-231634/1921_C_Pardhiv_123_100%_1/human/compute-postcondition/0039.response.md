To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The objects involved are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i`, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The other variables (`t`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `f` is the integer value from the first input line minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i`th and `(i-1)`th elements of `ls` and `b`, `a` is the integer value from the first input line, `b` is the integer value from the first input line, `ls` is a list of integers from the second input line, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least `t` - 2 test cases**
