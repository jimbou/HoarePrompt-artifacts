Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is the integer value from the first input line, a is the integer value from the first input line, b is the integer value from the first input line, ls is a list of integers from the second input line, i is n, stdin contains at least t - 2 test cases. The current value of f is greater than 0, where f is the integer value from the first input line minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of ls and b for i from 1 to n.**
