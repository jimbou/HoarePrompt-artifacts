The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `f` is the integer value from the first input line minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i`th and `(i-1)`th elements of `ls` and `b` minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i`th and `(i-1)`th elements of `ls` and `b`, `a` is the integer value from the first input line, `b` is the integer value from the first input line, `ls` is a list of integers from the second input line, `i` is 3, stdin contains at least `t` - 2 test cases**
