To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `n` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 1 as well.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is at least 1, `f` is the integer value from the first input line, `a` is the integer value from the first input line, `b` is the integer value from the first input line, `ls` is a list of integers from the second input line, `i` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases**
