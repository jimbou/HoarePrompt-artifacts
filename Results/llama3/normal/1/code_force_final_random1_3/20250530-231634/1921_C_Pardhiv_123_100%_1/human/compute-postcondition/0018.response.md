The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer decreased by 1, so for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a` * (`ls[i]` - `ls[i - 1]`) and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one line. The line contains `n` space-separated integers. If the final value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
