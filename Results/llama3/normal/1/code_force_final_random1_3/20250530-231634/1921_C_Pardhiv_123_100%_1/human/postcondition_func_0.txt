This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n integers in ascending order. The function calculates the value of f after subtracting the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive integers in the second line and b, for each pair of consecutive integers. If the final value of f is greater than 0, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
