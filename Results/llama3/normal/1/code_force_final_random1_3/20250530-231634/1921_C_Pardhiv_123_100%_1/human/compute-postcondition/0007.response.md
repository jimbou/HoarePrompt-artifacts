To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, it must also be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, `t`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `ls`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases**
