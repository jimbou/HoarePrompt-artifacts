Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, ls is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one line. The line contains n space-separated integers.**

The code reads the remaining test cases from stdin, one test case at a time. For each test case, it reads the first line, which contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b, and assigns them to the variables n, f, a, and b, respectively. Then, it reads the second line, which contains n space-separated integers, and assigns them to the list ls, prepending a 0 to the list. The variable t remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
