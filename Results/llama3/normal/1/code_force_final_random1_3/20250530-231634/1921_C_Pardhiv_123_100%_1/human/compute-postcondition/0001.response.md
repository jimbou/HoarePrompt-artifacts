The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, t is a positive integer, which means t is already greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. The first test case is partially read, and the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.**
