Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. The first test case is partially read, and the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
    ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
    if f > 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a` * (`ls[i]` - `ls[i - 1]`) and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one line. The line contains `n` space-separated integers. If the final value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is at least n, f is the integer value from the first input line minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of ls and b for all i from 1 to n, a is the integer value from the first input line, b is the integer value from the first input line, ls is a list of integers from the second input line, i is n, stdin contains t - 2 test cases. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is the integer value from the first input line, a is the integer value from the first input line, b is the integer value from the first input line, ls is a list of integers from the second input line, i is n, stdin contains at least t - 3 test cases. If f is greater than 0, where f is the integer value from the first input line minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of ls and b for i from 1 to n, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if f is less than or equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
