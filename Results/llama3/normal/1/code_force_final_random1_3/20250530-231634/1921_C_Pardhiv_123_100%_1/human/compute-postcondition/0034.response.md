Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is at least n, f is the integer value from the first input line minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of ls and b for all i from 1 to n, a is the integer value from the first input line, b is the integer value from the first input line, ls is a list of integers from the second input line, i is n, stdin contains t - 2 test cases. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t has decreased by 1, and the number of test cases in stdin has also decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' still depends on the value of f.
