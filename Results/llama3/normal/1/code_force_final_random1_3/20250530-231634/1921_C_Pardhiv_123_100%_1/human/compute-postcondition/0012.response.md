Output: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer, i is n, f is an integer decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is an integer, b is an integer, ls is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one line. The line contains n space-separated integers. The current value of f is greater than 0, and 'YES' is printed**
