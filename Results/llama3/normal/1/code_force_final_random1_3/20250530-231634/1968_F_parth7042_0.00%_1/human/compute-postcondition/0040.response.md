To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(q):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `q`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. If `q` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `q` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `q` needs to remain greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false, `idx` is n + 8, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `q` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, `pf` is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, `i` is n, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `l` is the integer value of data[n+6], `r` is the integer value of data[n+7], `x` is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], `v1` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, `v2` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, `it1` is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.**
