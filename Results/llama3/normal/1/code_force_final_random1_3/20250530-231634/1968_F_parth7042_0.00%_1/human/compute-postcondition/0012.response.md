Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 6, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4], a[2] is the integer value of data[5], and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4], pf[2] is the integer value of data[4] XOR the integer value of data[5], and the rest are zeros, i is 2, if pf[2] is not in mp, then mp is updated to have key pf[2] mapped to an empty list, and key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
