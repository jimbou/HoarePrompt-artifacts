Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `n + 2q + 4`, `a` is a list of `n+1` values where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+2]` and `a[3]` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+3]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` values where `pf[1]` is the XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]` and `pf[3]` is the XOR of `pf[2]` and `a[3]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one or two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0 and `i`, and if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, the key is `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing `i`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `q + 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` is true or false repeated `q` times, and `results` has an additional empty string at the end, `_` is `q + 1`, `l` is the integer value of `data[n+2q]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+1]`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one.**

The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list of values associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list. Otherwise, `mp` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected.
