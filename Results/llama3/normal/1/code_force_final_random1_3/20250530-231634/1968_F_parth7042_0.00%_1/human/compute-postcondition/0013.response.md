Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 6, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4], a[2] is the integer value of data[5], and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4], pf[2] is the integer value of data[4] XOR the integer value of data[5], and the rest are zeros, i is 2, mp[pf[2]] is updated to include 2, and mp[pf[1]] is a list containing 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one, the results list is still empty, the values of `idx`, `_`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n+1` values with `a[1]` and `a[2]` being the integer values of `data[4]` and `data[5]` respectively, and the rest being zeros. The list `pf` also remains unchanged with `pf[1]` and `pf[2]` being the integer values of `data[4]` and `data[4] XOR data[5]` respectively, and the rest being zeros. The value of `i` is still 2. The dictionary `mp` is updated such that the key `pf[2]` now maps to a list containing 2, and the key `pf[1]` still maps to a list containing 1.
