stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer t, then two integers n and q, and then a list of n integers, and then q pairs of integers. t is a positive integer, n and q are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The list of n integers contains non-negative integers less than 2^30. Each pair of integers contains two positive integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
