Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 6, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4], a[2] is the integer value of data[5], and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4], pf[2] is the integer value of data[4] XOR the integer value of data[5], and the rest are zeros, i is 2, mp is updated to have key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1.**

In this final state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `a[2]` and `pf[2]` have been updated based on the values of `data[idx]` and `pf[1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
