Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 5, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and key pf[1] mapped to an empty list, i is 1.**

In this output state, the dictionary mp has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is the current value of pf[i] (which is pf[1]) and the value is an empty list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
