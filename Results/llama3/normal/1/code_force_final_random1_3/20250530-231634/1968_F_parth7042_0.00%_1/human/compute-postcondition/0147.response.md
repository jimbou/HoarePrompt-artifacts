The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will print the contents of the `results` list, with each element separated by a newline character.

The `results` list contains 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, repeated `q` times. Additionally, it contains either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the conditions `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l` are true or false, repeated `q` times. Finally, it contains an empty string at the end, repeated `t` times.

Since the exact values of `pf[r]`, `pf[l - 1]`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `r`, and `l` are not provided, we can't determine the exact contents of the `results` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the contents of the `results` list, with each element separated by a newline character.

Output: **A sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, followed by a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, and finally a sequence of empty strings, all separated by newline characters, where the number of 'YES' or 'NO' strings and empty strings is determined by the values of q and t, respectively**
