Output State: **n is the integer value of data[idx], q is the integer value of data[idx + 1] and must be greater than 1, idx is incremented by n+7, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[idx+i-1], pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of pf[i-1] and a[i], mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is pf[i] and the value is a list containing i, i is n+1, idx is n + 2q + n + 2q + n + 8, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q-1 times, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0 and it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true, otherwise results has an additional 'NO' at the end, _ is 2, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and data has been consumed by 2q+n+7 integers, and n must be greater than or equal to 0. The current value of x is either 0 or not 0, if x is 0, then the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true. Otherwise, the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is not 0, and results has an additional 'NO' at the end. Additionally, it1 is either less than len(v1) and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than or equal to r and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results has an additional 'NO' at the end.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The initial state remains mostly unchanged, with the exception of the following modifications:

*   `idx` is incremented by 2, resulting in a new value of `n + 2q + n + 2q + n + 8`.
*   `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[n+2q]`.
*   `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[n+2q+1]`.
*   `x` is assigned the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
*   The value of `x` determines the last element of the `results` list. If `x` is 0, the last element is 'YES' if the conditions `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` are true, otherwise it is 'NO'. If `x` is not 0, the last element is 'NO' if the conditions `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` are true, otherwise it is 'YES'.
*   The `data` has been consumed by `2q+n+7` integers.
