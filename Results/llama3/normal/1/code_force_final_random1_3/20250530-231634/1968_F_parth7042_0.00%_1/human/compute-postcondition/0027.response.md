Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, results is a list, idx is n + 6, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, l is the integer value of data[n+4], r is the integer value of data[n+5], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one. The current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and the current value of v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l.**
