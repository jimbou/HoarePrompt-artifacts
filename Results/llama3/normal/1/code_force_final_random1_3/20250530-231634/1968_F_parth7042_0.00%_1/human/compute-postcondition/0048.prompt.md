Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is n + 4, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, and mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
* The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
* The results list remains empty.
* The idx variable has been incremented to `n + 4`, where `n` is the number of iterations.
* The `_` variable remains unchanged as 0.
* The `n` variable remains unchanged as an integer.
* The `q` variable remains unchanged as an integer.
* The `a` list now contains the integer values of `data` from index 4 to `n + 3`, with `a[0]` remaining as 0.
* The `pf` list now contains the prefix XOR values of the `data` list from index 4 to `n + 3`, with `pf[0]` remaining as 0.
* The `i` variable has been incremented to `n`, indicating the number of iterations.
* The `mp` dictionary now contains all the prefix XOR values as keys, with their corresponding values being lists of indices where those prefix XOR values occur.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, results is a list, idx is n + 6, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, l is the integer value of data[n+4], r is the integer value of data[n+5], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one. If it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, then results is a list containing 'YES'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false, idx is n + 8, _ is 1, n is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, l is the integer value of data[n+6], r is the integer value of data[n+7], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false and 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise no change and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the condition it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l), idx is n + 10, _ is 2, n is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, l is the integer value of data[n+6], r is the integer value of data[n+7], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
