Output State: **t is a positive integer, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false and 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise no change, idx is n + 10, _ is 2, n is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, l is the integer value of data[n+6], r is the integer value of data[n+7], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.**

The code retrieves the list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs and assigns it to v1, and the list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs and assigns it to v2. Then, it calculates the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order and assigns it to it1, and the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one and assigns it to it2. The values of t, results, idx, _, n, q, a, pf, i, mp, l, r, and x remain unchanged.
