To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(q):`. The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop variable, and `q`, which is the range.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `q`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 (since it's the first iteration), and `q` is greater than 0.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `_` by 1, so `_` becomes 1. The value of `q` remains the same.

State: **n is greater than or equal to n, i is n + 1, q is greater than 0, idx is n + 2q + n + 3, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[n+2q+2], a[2] is the integer value of data[n+2q+3], ..., a[n] is the integer value of data[idx - 3], pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the XOR of pf[0] and a[1], pf[2] is the XOR of pf[1] and a[2], ..., pf[n] is the XOR of pf[n - 1] and a[n], mp is a dictionary with either one or two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0 and i, and the key is pf[i] and the value is a list containing i, t is a positive integer greater than q + 1, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results has an additional empty string at the end, _ is 1, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and data has been consumed by two integers. If it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, then results has an additional 'YES' appended to it. Otherwise, results has an additional 'NO' appended to it.**
