Output State: **n is the integer value of data[idx], q is the integer value of data[idx + 1] and must be greater than 0, idx is incremented by n+5, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[idx+i-1], pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of pf[i-1] and a[i], mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is pf[i] and the value is a list containing i, i is n+1, idx is n + 2q + n + 2q + n + 6, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q-1 times, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results has an additional empty string at the end, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true, otherwise results has an additional 'NO' at the end, _ is 1, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and data has been consumed by 2q+n+5 integers, and results has an additional empty string at the end, and n must be greater than or equal to 0. The current value of x is either 0 or not 0, if x is 0, then the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end. Otherwise, the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is not 0, and results has an additional empty string at the end. Additionally, it1 is either less than len(v1) and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than or equal to r and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end, or it1 is not less than len(v1) or it2 is less than 0 or v1[it1] is greater than r or v2[it2] is less than l, and results has an additional 'NO' at the end, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end.**

The code block consists of two lines: `results.append('YES')` and `continue`. The first line appends the string 'YES' to the end of the `results` list. The second line, `continue`, skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration.

The initial state describes a complex scenario with multiple variables and data structures. The code block modifies the `results` list by appending 'YES' to it. The rest of the variables and data structures remain unchanged.

In the final state, all the variables and data structures retain their initial values, except for the `results` list, which has an additional 'YES' at the end. The value of `x` is either 0 or not 0, and the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is either 0 or not 0, depending on the value of `x`. The value of `it1` is either less than `len(v1)` or not, and the value of `it2` is either greater than or equal to 0 or not, affecting the additional 'YES' or 'NO' at the end of the `results` list.
