Output State: **n is the integer value of data[idx], q is the integer value of data[idx + 1], idx is incremented by 2, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0, i is n + 1, idx is n + 2q + n + 2q + 3, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results has an additional empty string at the end, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true, otherwise results has an additional 'NO' at the end, _ is q + 1, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and data has been consumed by 2q+2 integers, and results has an additional empty string at the end.**

Note that the values of `n`, `q`, `idx`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` have been updated according to the code. The values of `i`, `idx`, `results`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `data` has been consumed by 2q+2 integers.
