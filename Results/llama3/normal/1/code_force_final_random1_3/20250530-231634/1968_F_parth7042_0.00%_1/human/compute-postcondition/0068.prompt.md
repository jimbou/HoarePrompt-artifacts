Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is the integer value of data[idx], q is the integer value of data[idx + 1], idx is n + 2q + 2, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0, t is a positive integer greater than q + 1, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, and results has an additional empty string at the end, idx is n + 2q, _ is q + 1, i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `idx` is `n + 2q + 3`, `a` is a list of `n+1` values where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+2]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` values where `pf[1]` is the XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one or two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0, and if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, the key is `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing `i`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `q + 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` is true or false repeated `q` times, and `results` has an additional empty string at the end, `_` is `q + 1`, `l` is the integer value of `data[n+2q]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+1]`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
