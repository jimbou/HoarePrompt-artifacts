The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 5, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, i is 2, mp is updated to have key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1.**
