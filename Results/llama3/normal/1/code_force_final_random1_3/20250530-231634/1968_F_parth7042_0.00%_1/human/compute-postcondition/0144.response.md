Output State: **n is the integer value of data[idx], q is the integer value of data[idx + 1] and must be greater than or equal to 0, idx is incremented by n+2q+1, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[idx+i-1], pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of pf[i-1] and a[i], mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is pf[i] and the value is a list containing i, i is n+1, idx is n + 2q + n + 2q + n + 2q + 2, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated 0 times, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0 and it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true, otherwise results has an additional 'NO' at the end, _ is q, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and data has been consumed by 2q+n+2q+1 integers, and n must be greater than or equal to 0.**

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has iterated q times, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `_` is now q, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` have been updated based on the last iteration of the loop. The `results` list now contains the final results of the program, which include the 'YES' or 'NO' values based on the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` and the conditions `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)`. The `data` has been consumed by `2q+n+2q+1` integers, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
