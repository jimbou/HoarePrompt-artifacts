The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the values of variables `a`, `idx`, and `pf`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `a[i]`. Since `idx` is 4 and `i` is 1, `a[1]` becomes the integer value of `data[4]`.
*   The second line increments `idx` by 1, making `idx` equal to 5.
*   The third line assigns the value of `pf[i - 1]` XOR `a[i]` to `pf[i]`. Since `pf[0]` is 0 (from the initial state) and `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `pf[1]` becomes the XOR of 0 and the integer value of `data[4]`, which is simply the integer value of `data[4]`.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
