Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the XOR of its elements. The program calculates the prefix XOR of the array and stores the indices of each XOR value in a dictionary. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the prefix XOR values at the given indices is 0, or if there exists an index in the dictionary that satisfies certain conditions. If either condition is true, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

The program also handles the edge case where the XOR of the prefix XOR values is 0, in which case the subarray is always interesting.

The use of binary search (bisect_left) to find the indices in the dictionary is also correct and efficient.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its execution summary accurately reflects its behavior.

Correctness: **True**
