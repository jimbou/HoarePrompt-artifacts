Output State: **n is the integer value of data[idx], q is the integer value of data[idx + 1] and must be greater than 0, idx is incremented by n+5, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[idx+i-1], pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of pf[i-1] and a[i], mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is pf[i] and the value is a list containing i, i is n+1, idx is n + 2q + n + 2q + n + 6, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q-1 times, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results has an additional empty string at the end, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true, otherwise results has an additional 'NO' at the end, _ is 1, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and data has been consumed by 2q+n+5 integers, and results has an additional empty string at the end, and n must be greater than or equal to 0. The current value of x is either 0 or not 0, if x is 0, then the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end. Otherwise, the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is not 0, and results has an additional empty string at the end. Additionally, it1 is either less than len(v1) and it2 is greater than or equal to 0 and v1[it1] is less than or equal to r and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end, or it1 is not less than len(v1) or it2 is less than 0 or v1[it1] is greater than r or v2[it2] is less than l, and results has an additional 'NO' at the end.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `l`, `r`, `idx`, and `x`. The value of `l` is set to the integer value of `data[idx]`, and the value of `r` is set to the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`. The value of `idx` is incremented by 2. The value of `x` is set to the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
