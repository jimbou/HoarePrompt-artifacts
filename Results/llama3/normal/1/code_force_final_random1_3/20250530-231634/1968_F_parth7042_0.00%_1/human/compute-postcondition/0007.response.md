Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 5, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, i is 1. If pf[i] is not in mp, then mp is updated to have key pf[1] mapped to an empty list. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
