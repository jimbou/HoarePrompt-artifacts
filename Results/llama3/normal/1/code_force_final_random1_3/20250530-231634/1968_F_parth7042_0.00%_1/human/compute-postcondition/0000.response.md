Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 2**

The code reads the first test case from stdin and extracts the value of t. The value of idx is incremented twice to point to the next input. The variable results is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected.
