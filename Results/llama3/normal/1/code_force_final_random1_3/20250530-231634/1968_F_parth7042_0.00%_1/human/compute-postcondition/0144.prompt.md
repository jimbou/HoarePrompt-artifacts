Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer value of data[idx], `q` is the integer value of data[idx + 1], `idx` is incremented by `n+1`, `a` is a list of `n+1` values where `a[i]` is the integer value of data[idx+i-1], `pf` is a list of `n+1` values where `pf[i]` is the XOR of `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with `n+1` key-value pairs where the key is `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing `i`, `i` is `n+1`, `idx` is `n + 2q + n + 2q + n + 2`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` is true or false repeated `q` times, and `results` has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise `results` has an additional empty string at the end, and `results` has an additional 'YES' at the end if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `results` has an additional 'NO' at the end, `_` is `q + 1`, `l` is the integer value of data[n+2q], `r` is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one, and `data` has been consumed by `2q+n+1` integers, and `results` has an additional empty string at the end, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is the integer value of data[idx], `q` is the integer value of data[idx + 1] and must be greater than 0, `idx` is incremented by `n+3`, `a` is a list of `n+1` values where `a[i]` is the integer value of data[idx+i-1], `pf` is a list of `n+1` values where `pf[i]` is the XOR of `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with `n+1` key-value pairs where the key is `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing `i`, `i` is `n+1`, `idx` is `n + 2q + n + 2q + n + 4`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` is true or false repeated `q` times, and `results` has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise `results` has an additional empty string at the end, and `results` has an additional 'YES' at the end if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `results` has an additional 'NO' at the end, `_` is 0, `l` is the integer value of data[n+2q], `r` is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one, and `data` has been consumed by `2q+n+3` integers, and `results` has an additional empty string at the end, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `x` is either 0 or not 0, if `x` is 0, then the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, and `results` has an additional 'YES' at the end. Otherwise, the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is not 0, and `results` has an additional empty string at the end. Additionally, `it1` is either less than `len(v1)` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r` and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, and `results` has an additional 'YES' at the end, or `it1` is not less than `len(v1)` or `it2` is less than 0 or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r` or `v2[it2]` is less than `l`, and `results` has an additional 'NO' at the end.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
