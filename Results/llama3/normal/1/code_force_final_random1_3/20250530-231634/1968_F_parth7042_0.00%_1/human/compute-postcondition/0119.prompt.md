You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: n is the integer value of data[idx], q is the integer value of data[idx + 1] and must be greater than 0, idx is incremented by n+3, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[idx+i-1], pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of pf[i-1] and a[i], mp is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs where the key is pf[i] and the value is a list containing i, i is n+1, idx is n + 2q + n + 2q + n + 4, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results has an additional empty string at the end, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true, otherwise results has an additional 'NO' at the end, _ is 0, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and data has been consumed by 2q+n+3 integers, and results has an additional empty string at the end, and n must be greater than or equal to 0.
if condition:
```
if (x == 0):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
In your response strictly use the format: Postcondition: **the postcondition you calculate.**, and describe this postcondition in Natural language easily understandable by humans
