Postcondition: ***n is the integer value of data[idx], q is the integer value of data[idx + 1], idx is incremented by 5, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[idx], a[2] is the integer value of data[idx+1], a[4] is the integer value of data[idx+4], pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the XOR of pf[0] and a[1], pf[2] is the XOR of pf[1] and a[2], pf[4] is the XOR of pf[3] and a[4], mp is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0, the key is pf[i] and the value is a list containing i, and the key is pf[4] and the value is a list containing 4, i is 5, idx is n + 2q + n + 2q + 6, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results has an additional empty string at the end, and results has an additional 'YES' at the end if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true, otherwise results has an additional 'NO' at the end, _ is q + 1, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, and data has been consumed by 2q+5 integers, and results has an additional empty string at the end, and n must be greater than 4. If pf[i] is not in mp, then mp is a dictionary with four key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0, the key is pf[i] and the value is an empty list, the key is pf[4] and the value is a list containing 4, and the key is pf[i] and the value is an empty list.***
