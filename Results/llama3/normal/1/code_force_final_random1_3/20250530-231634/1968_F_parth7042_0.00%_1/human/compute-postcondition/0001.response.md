The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, the variable `_` is not initialized, so it needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `results` is an empty list, `idx` is 2, `_` is 0**
