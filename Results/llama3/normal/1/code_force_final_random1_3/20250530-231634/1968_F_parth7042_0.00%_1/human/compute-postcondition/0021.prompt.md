You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is n + 4, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, and mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
* The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
* The results list remains empty.
* The idx variable has been incremented to `n + 4`, where `n` is the number of iterations.
* The `_` variable remains unchanged as 0.
* The `n` variable remains unchanged as an integer.
* The `q` variable remains unchanged as an integer.
* The `a` list now contains the integer values of `data` from index 4 to `n + 3`, with `a[0]` remaining as 0.
* The `pf` list now contains the prefix XOR values of the `data` list from index 4 to `n + 3`, with `pf[0]` remaining as 0.
* The `i` variable has been incremented to `n`, indicating the number of iterations.
* The `mp` dictionary now contains all the prefix XOR values as keys, with their corresponding values being lists of indices where those prefix XOR values occur.
```
for _ in range(q):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
