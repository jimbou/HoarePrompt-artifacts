Output: **idx is incremented by t*(n+2q+1), results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, and results has an additional empty string at the end repeated t times, and data has been consumed by t*(n+2q+1) integers, and the following is printed: a string containing all the elements of the results list separated by a newline character**
