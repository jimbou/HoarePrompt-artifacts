Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the subarray has only two elements and they are equal. In this case, the program should return "YES" because the subarray can be divided into two parts with equal XOR values (each part containing one element), but the program returns "NO".

For example, consider the input:

5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4

The program should return "YES" for the query (1, 3) because the subarray [1, 1] can be divided into two parts [1] and [1] with equal XOR values. However, the program returns "NO".

This is because the program checks if the XOR value of the subarray is equal to 0, and if it is not, it checks if there are two indices in the prefix sum array that have the same value as the XOR value of the subarray. However, this check is not sufficient to cover all cases, and the program misses the case where the subarray has only two elements and they are equal.
