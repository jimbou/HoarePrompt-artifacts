Output State: **n is the integer value of data[idx], q is the integer value of data[idx + 1], idx is n + 2q + 2, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0, t is a positive integer greater than q + 1, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, and results has an additional empty string at the end, idx is n + 2q, _ is q + 1, i is n, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.**

The code executes as follows: The first line assigns the integer value of data[idx] to n. The second line assigns the integer value of data[idx + 1] to q. The third line increments idx by 2. The fourth line initializes a list a with n+1 zeros. The fifth line initializes a list pf with n+1 zeros. The sixth line initializes a dictionary mp with a single key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0. The values of t, results, idx, _, i, l, r, x, v1, v2, it1, and it2 remain unchanged.
