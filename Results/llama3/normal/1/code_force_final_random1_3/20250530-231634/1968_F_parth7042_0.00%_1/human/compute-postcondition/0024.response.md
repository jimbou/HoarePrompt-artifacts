Output State: **t is a positive integer, results is a list containing 'YES', idx is n + 6, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, l is the integer value of data[n+4], r is the integer value of data[n+5], and x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] and equals 0.**

The code snippet appends the string 'YES' to the results list and then skips to the next iteration of the loop using the continue statement. This means that the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped, and the loop moves on to the next iteration. As a result, the values of all variables except results remain unchanged.
