To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

The states of other variables (`q`, `idx`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `t`, `results`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2`) do not need to be adjusted, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `idx` is `n + 2q + 3`, `a` is a list of `n+1` values where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+2]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` values where `pf[1]` is the XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one or two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0, and if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, the key is `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing `i`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `q + 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` is true or false repeated `q` times, and `results` has an additional empty string at the end, `_` is `q + 1`, `l` is the integer value of `data[n+2q]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+1]`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one.**
