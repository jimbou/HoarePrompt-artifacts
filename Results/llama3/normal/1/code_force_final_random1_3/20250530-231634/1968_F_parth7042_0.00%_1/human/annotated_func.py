#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer t, then two integers n and q, and then a list of n integers, and then q pairs of integers. t is a positive integer, n and q are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The list of n integers contains non-negative integers less than 2^30. Each pair of integers contains two positive integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = {(0): [0]}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: idx is incremented by t*(n+2q+1), results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, and results has an additional empty string at the end repeated t times, and data has been consumed by t*(n+2q+1) integers.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: A sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, followed by a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, and finally a sequence of empty strings, all separated by newline characters, where the number of 'YES' or 'NO' strings and empty strings is determined by the values of q and t, respectively

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer t, followed by two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers. It then processes each test case by calculating the prefix XOR of the list of integers and storing the indices of each XOR value in a dictionary. For each pair of integers, it checks if the XOR of the prefix XOR values at the given indices is 0, or if there exists an index in the dictionary that satisfies certain conditions. Based on these checks, it appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list. Finally, it prints the results list, which contains 'YES' or 'NO' strings for each pair of integers in each test case, followed by an empty string for each test case.
