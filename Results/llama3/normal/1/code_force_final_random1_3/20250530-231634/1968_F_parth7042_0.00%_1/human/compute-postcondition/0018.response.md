Output State: **t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, idx is 7, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 3, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4], a[2] is the integer value of data[5], a[3] is the integer value of data[6], and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4], pf[2] is the integer value of data[4] XOR the integer value of data[5], pf[3] is the integer value of data[4] XOR the integer value of data[5] XOR the integer value of data[6], and the rest are zeros, i is 3, mp[pf[2]] is a list containing 2 and 3, mp[pf[1]] is a list containing 1, and mp[pf[3]] is a list containing 3.**

The code appends the value of i to the list mp[pf[i]]. Since i is 3 and pf[3] is the integer value of data[4] XOR the integer value of data[5] XOR the integer value of data[6], mp[pf[3]] now contains 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
