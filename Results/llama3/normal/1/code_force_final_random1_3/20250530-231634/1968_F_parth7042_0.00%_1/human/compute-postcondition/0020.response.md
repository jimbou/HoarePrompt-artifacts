Output State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is n + 4, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, and mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
* The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
* The results list remains empty.
* The idx variable has been incremented to `n + 4`, where `n` is the number of iterations.
* The `_` variable remains unchanged as 0.
* The `n` variable remains unchanged as an integer.
* The `q` variable remains unchanged as an integer.
* The `a` list now contains the integer values of `data` from index 4 to `n + 3`, with `a[0]` remaining as 0.
* The `pf` list now contains the prefix XOR values of the `data` list from index 4 to `n + 3`, with `pf[0]` remaining as 0.
* The `i` variable has been incremented to `n`, indicating the number of iterations.
* The `mp` dictionary now contains all the prefix XOR values as keys, with their corresponding values being lists of indices where those prefix XOR values occur.
