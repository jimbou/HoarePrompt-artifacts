Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `q` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2q + n + 5`, `a` is a list of `n+1` values where `a[1]` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+2]`, `a[2]` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+3]`, ..., `a[n]` is the integer value of `data[idx - 5]`, `pf` is a list of `n+1` values where `pf[1]` is the XOR of `pf[0]` and `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is the XOR of `pf[1]` and `a[2]`, ..., `pf[n]` is the XOR of `pf[n - 1]` and `a[n]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one or two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing 0 and `i`, and the key is `pf[i]` and the value is a list containing `i`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `q + 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` is true or false repeated `q` times, and `results` has an additional 'YES' at the end if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise `results` has an additional empty string at the end, `_` is 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[n+2q]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[n+2q+1]`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[r]` occurs, `v2` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[l - 1]` occurs, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order, and `it2` is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one, and `data` has been consumed by four integers. If the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, `results` has an additional 'YES' at the end. Otherwise, `results` has an additional empty string at the end, and `results` has an additional 'NO' at the end.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `results` has an additional 'NO' at the end.
