Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is interesting or not based on the XOR of its elements.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, the number of queries, the array elements, and the query ranges.

2. It initializes the necessary data structures, including the prefix XOR array `pf` and the hashmap `mp` to store the indices of elements with the same XOR value.

3. For each query, it correctly calculates the XOR of the subarray elements using the prefix XOR array `pf`.

4. If the XOR is 0, it immediately returns 'YES' because the subarray is interesting.

5. If the XOR is not 0, it uses the hashmap `mp` to find the indices of elements with the same XOR value. It then uses binary search to find the indices `it1` and `it2` that satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

6. If the conditions are met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

7. Finally, it prints the results for all queries, separated by newline characters, with an additional empty string at the end of each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
