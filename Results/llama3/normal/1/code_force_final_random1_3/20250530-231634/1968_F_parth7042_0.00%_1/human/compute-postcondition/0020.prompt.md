Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 4, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 5, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, i is 1, mp is updated to have key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 6, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4], a[2] is the integer value of data[5], and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4], pf[2] is the integer value of data[4] XOR the integer value of data[5], and the rest are zeros, i is 2, mp[pf[2]] is updated to include 2, and mp[pf[1]] is a list containing 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, idx is 7, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 3, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4], a[2] is the integer value of data[5], a[3] is the integer value of data[6], and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4], pf[2] is the integer value of data[4] XOR the integer value of data[5], pf[3] is the integer value of data[4] XOR the integer value of data[5] XOR the integer value of data[6], and the rest are zeros, i is 3, mp[pf[2]] is a list containing 2 and 3, mp[pf[1]] is a list containing 1, and mp[pf[3]] is a list containing 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
