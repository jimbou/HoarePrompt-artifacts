Output State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is n + 4, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[4 + i - 1] for i in range(1, n + 1) and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4 + j - 1] for j in range(1, i + 1) for i in range(1, n + 1) and pf[0] is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value pf[i] for i in range(1, n + 1) and the corresponding value is a list of indices i where pf[i] is equal to the key.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The variable `t` remains a positive integer, indicating the number of test cases.
* The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one.
* The list `results` remains empty.
* The index `idx` has moved `n` positions forward, pointing to the next input value after the current test case.
* The variable `_` remains 0, indicating no change.
* The integer `n` remains the same, representing the size of the input array.
* The integer `q` remains the same, representing the number of queries.
* The list `a` now contains the integer values of the input data, where `a[i]` is the integer value of `data[4 + i - 1]` for `i` in range(1, `n` + 1), and `a[0]` is 0.
* The list `pf` now contains the prefix XOR values, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the integer values of `data[4 + j - 1]` for `j` in range(1, `i` + 1) for `i` in range(1, `n` + 1), and `pf[0]` is 0.
* The variable `i` has reached the value `n`, indicating the end of the loop.
* The dictionary `mp` now contains the prefix XOR values as keys, and the corresponding values are lists of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is equal to the key.
