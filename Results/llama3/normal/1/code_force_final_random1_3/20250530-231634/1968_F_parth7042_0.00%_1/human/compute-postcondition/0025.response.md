Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, results is a list, idx is n + 6, _ is 0, n is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, l is the integer value of data[n+4], r is the integer value of data[n+5], and x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1]. If x equals 0, results is a list containing 'YES'.***
