Output State: **t is a positive integer, results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, idx is n + 2q, _ is q, n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[i] is the integer value of data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and a[0] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[i] is the XOR of the integer values of data[4] to data[i+3] for i from 1 to n and pf[0] is 0, i is n, mp is a dictionary where each key is a prefix XOR value and its corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, l is the integer value of data[n+2q], r is the integer value of data[n+2q+1], x is the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1], v1 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[r] occurs, v2 is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value pf[l - 1] occurs, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, and it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
* The `results` list contains 'YES' if the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` is 0, otherwise it contains 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)` is true or false, repeated `q` times.
* The `idx` variable has been incremented to `n + 2q`.
* The `_` variable has been incremented to `q`.
* The `n` variable remains unchanged as an integer.
* The `q` variable remains unchanged as an integer.
* The `a` list remains unchanged, containing the integer values of `data` from index 4 to `n + 3`, with `a[0]` remaining as 0.
* The `pf` list remains unchanged, containing the prefix XOR values of the `data` list from index 4 to `n + 3`, with `pf[0]` remaining as 0.
* The `i` variable remains unchanged as `n`.
* The `mp` dictionary remains unchanged, containing all the prefix XOR values as keys, with their corresponding values being lists of indices where those prefix XOR values occur.
* The `l` variable is the integer value of `data[n+2q]`.
* The `r` variable is the integer value of `data[n+2q+1]`.
* The `x` variable is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
* The `v1` variable is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[r]` occurs.
* The `v2` variable is a list of indices where the prefix XOR value `pf[l - 1]` occurs.
* The `it1` variable is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order.
* The `it2` variable is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one.
