Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer t, followed by two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers. It then processes each test case by calculating the prefix XOR of the list of integers and storing the indices of each XOR value in a dictionary. For each pair of integers, it checks if the XOR of the prefix XOR values at the given indices is 0, or if there exists an index in the dictionary that satisfies certain conditions. Based on these checks, it appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list. Finally, it prints the results list, which contains 'YES' or 'NO' strings for each pair of integers in each test case, followed by an empty string for each test case.**
