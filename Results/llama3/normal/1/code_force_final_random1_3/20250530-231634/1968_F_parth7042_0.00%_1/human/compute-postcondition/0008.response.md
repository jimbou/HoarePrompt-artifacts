Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, results is an empty list, idx is 5, _ is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 1, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 values where a[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, pf is a list of n+1 values where pf[1] is the integer value of data[4] and the rest are zeros, i is 1, mp is updated to have key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by one, the `results` list remains empty, the value of `idx` remains 5, the value of `_` remains 0, the value of `n` remains at least 1, the value of `q` remains unchanged, the list `a` remains unchanged with `a[1]` being the integer value of `data[4]` and the rest being zeros, the list `pf` remains unchanged with `pf[1]` being the integer value of `data[4]` and the rest being zeros, the value of `i` remains 1, and the dictionary `mp` is updated to have a key-value pair where the key is `pf[1]` and the value is a list containing the integer 1.
