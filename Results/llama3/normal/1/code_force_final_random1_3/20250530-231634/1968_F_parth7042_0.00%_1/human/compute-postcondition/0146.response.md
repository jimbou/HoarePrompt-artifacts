Output State: **idx is incremented by t*(n+2q+1), results is a list containing 'YES' if the XOR of pf[r] and pf[l - 1] is 0, otherwise 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l) is true or false repeated q times, and results has an additional empty string at the end repeated t times, and data has been consumed by t*(n+2q+1) integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the index `idx` has been incremented by the total number of integers consumed from the input data, which is `t*(n+2q+1)`. The `results` list contains the results of the queries, where each query result is either 'YES' if the XOR of the prefix sums is 0, or 'NO' followed by either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether there is a subarray with the desired XOR value. The `results` list has an additional empty string at the end for each test case. Finally, the input data has been consumed by `t*(n+2q+1)` integers.
