Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `num` is a list containing the integer `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-7` lines if `t` is 3, otherwise it contains `n-6` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 2 or 3, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3. If `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, otherwise `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9. `end` is set to the minimum of its original value and `v` if `t` is 2.***
