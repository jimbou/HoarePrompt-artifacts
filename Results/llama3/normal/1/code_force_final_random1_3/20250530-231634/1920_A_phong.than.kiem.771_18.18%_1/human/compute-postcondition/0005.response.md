Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and is greater than -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is 1, the current value of `t` is 1, and `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to the current value of `v`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and is greater than -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n-2` lines, as one line has been read to update the value of `start`. The current value of `t` is still 1, and `v` is still an integer between 1 and 10^9.
