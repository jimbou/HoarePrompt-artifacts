Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integers `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n-1`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

*   `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100.
*   `start` will be either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, depending on whether any `t` equals 1 and `v` is greater than the initial value of `start`.
*   `end` will be a float between 1 and 10^9, which is the minimum of its original value and all `v` values when `t` equals 2.
*   `num` will be a list containing all `v` values when `t` equals 3. If no `t` equals 3, `num` will be an empty list.
*   `stdin` will be empty because all lines have been read.
*   `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates `n` times.
*   `v` will be an integer between 1 and 10^9, which is the value of `v` in the last iteration.
*   `t` will be an integer between 1 and 3, which is the value of `t` in the last iteration.
