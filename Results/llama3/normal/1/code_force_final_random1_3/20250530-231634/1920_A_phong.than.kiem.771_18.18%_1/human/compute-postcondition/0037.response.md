Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integers `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n-1`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3, `count_num` is 0**

The code introduces a new variable `count_num` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
