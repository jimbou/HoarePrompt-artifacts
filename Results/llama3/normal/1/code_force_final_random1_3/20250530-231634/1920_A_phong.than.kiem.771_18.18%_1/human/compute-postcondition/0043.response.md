Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least one integer `v`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3. If the first element `i` in `num` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop and `count_num` remains 0. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented to 1.***
