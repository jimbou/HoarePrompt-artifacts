Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least one integer `v`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is 1. The first element `i` in `num` is larger or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
