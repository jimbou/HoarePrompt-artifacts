Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integer `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-4` lines if `t` is 3, otherwise it contains `n-3` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 1 or 2, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3, and if `t` is 2, then `end` is set to the minimum of its original value and `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to be equal to `v`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `start` is no longer either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, but is now specifically an integer between 1 and 10^9, equal to `v`.
