Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integers `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the last element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end`. The current value of `start` is higher than the current value of `end`.**
