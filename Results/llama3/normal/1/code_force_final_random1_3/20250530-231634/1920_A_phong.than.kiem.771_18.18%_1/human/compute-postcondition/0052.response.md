Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integers `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the last element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

- The initial state variables `n`, `start`, `end`, `v`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The list `num` contains the integers `v` if `t` is 3; otherwise, it is an empty list.
- The variable `stdin` remains empty.
- The variable `i` points to the last element in the list `num`.
- The variable `count_num` is incremented by 1 for each element in `num` that falls within the range of `start` and `end`.
