You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) and then n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integers `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n-1`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integers `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the last element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end`.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the integer 0
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integers `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the last element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end`. Additionally, `start` is less than or equal to `end`
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the range of `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end`, where `num` is a list containing integers `v` if `t` is 3 (which is the case here), and `t` is 3.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between the range of `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end`, where `num` is a list containing integers `v` if `t` is 3 (which is the case here), and `t` is 3.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
