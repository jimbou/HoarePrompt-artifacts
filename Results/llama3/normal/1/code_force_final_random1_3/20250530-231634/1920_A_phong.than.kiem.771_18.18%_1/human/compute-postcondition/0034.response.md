Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `num` is a list containing the integer `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is a list containing the integer `v`, `stdin` contains `n-8` lines if `t` is 3, otherwise it contains `n-7` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 2 or 3, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3. If `t` is 1, then `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, otherwise if `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, otherwise `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to the minimum of its original value and `v`.**

In this output state, the list `num` now contains the integer `v` regardless of the value of `t`, and the number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
