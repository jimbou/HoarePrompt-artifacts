Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least one integer `v`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is 0. The current value of `i` is either less than the current value of `start` or greater than the current value of `end` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, and the only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
