Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integers `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n-1`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3, `count_num` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least one integer `v`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3. If the first element `i` in `num` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop and `count_num` remains 0. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least two integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the second element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop skips to the next iteration and `count_num` remains 1. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least three integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the third element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3. If `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
