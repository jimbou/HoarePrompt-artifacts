Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. The program uses a series of functions to read input, process the constraints, and calculate the final answer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) using Function 1 (func_1).
2. For each test case, the program reads the number of constraints (n) using Function 1 (func_1).
3. The program then reads each constraint using Function 2 (func_2), which splits the input line into two integers: the type of constraint (a) and the value (x).
4. The program uses a series of if-else statements to process each constraint:
	* If the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), the program updates the start value if it is less than the current start value.
	* If the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), the program updates the end value if it is greater than the current end value.
	* If the constraint is of type 3 (k must be not equal to x), the program adds the value to a list of numbers to exclude.
5. After processing all constraints, the program calculates the final answer by subtracting the count of excluded numbers from the range of possible values (end - start + 1). If the result is negative, the program returns 0.
6. The program repeats steps 2-5 for each test case and prints the final answer for each case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues with the code:

* The program uses a lot of global variables, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It would be better to encapsulate the variables and functions within a class or a single function.
* The program uses a series of if-else statements to process each constraint, which can be replaced with a more concise and efficient approach using a dictionary or a switch statement.
* The program uses a list to store the excluded numbers, which can be replaced with a set for faster lookup times.

Despite these minor issues, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
