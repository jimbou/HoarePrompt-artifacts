Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least two integers, `i` is the second element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and the only effect of the `continue` statement is that it skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop.
