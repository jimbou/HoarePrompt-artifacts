To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. The loop will execute if `num` has at least one element. Since `num` is a list containing the integers `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure `num` has at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least one integer `v`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is 0**
