Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least three integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the third element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement only skips the current iteration and moves to the next one, without changing any variable values.
