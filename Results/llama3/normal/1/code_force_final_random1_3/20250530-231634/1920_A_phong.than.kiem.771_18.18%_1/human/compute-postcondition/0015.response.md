Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integer `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines if `t` is 3, otherwise it contains `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 0 or 1, and `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to the minimum of its original value and `v`.***
