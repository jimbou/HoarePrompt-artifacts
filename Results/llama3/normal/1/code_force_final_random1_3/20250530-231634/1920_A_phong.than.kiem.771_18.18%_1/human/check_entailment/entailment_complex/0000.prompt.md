Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer value that is provided as input by the user, regardless of the initial value of the boolean variable `isOne`.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the number 1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function returns an integer value based on the input boolean variable `isOne`. If `isOne` is False, it prompts the user for an integer input and returns that value. If `isOne` is True, it returns the number 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value indicating whether the input should be split into items based on spaces, to_int is a boolean value indicating whether the items should be converted to integers.
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: *`space` is a boolean value, `to_int` is a boolean value, `line` is a string containing the input from stdin, `items` is a list. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of strings split from `line` based on spaces. Otherwise, `items` is a list of characters from the input string.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers. If `space` is True, the list contains integers converted from the strings split from the input string `line` based on spaces. Otherwise, the list contains integers converted from the characters in the input string `line`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of strings or characters from the input string, depending on the value of the boolean variable `space`. If `space` is True, the list contains strings split from the input string based on spaces. Otherwise, the list contains individual characters from the input string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a boolean value `space` and another boolean value `to_int` as input, reads a line of input from stdin, and processes it based on the values of `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, it splits the input line into strings based on spaces; otherwise, it treats the input line as individual characters. If `to_int` is True, it converts the processed items into integers; otherwise, it leaves them as strings or characters. The function then returns the resulting list of integers, strings, or characters.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values that can be converted to strings and sym is a string.
    string = ''

    #State: `arr` is a list of values that can be converted to strings, `sym` is a string, `string` is a string that is the concatenation of the string representation of all values in `arr` and `sym` in the order they appear in `arr`, and `i` is the last value in the list `arr`.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of the string representation of all values in the list `arr` and the string `sym` in the order they appear in `arr`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of values and a string as input, converts each value in the list to a string, and concatenates them with the given string in between each value, returning the resulting concatenated string.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings, and substring is a substring of string.
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:

    #State: string is a string, substring is a substring of string, indices is a list containing all the starting positions of substring within string, index is -1.
    return indices
    #The program returns a list of all the starting positions of substring within string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string and a substring as input and returns a list of all the starting positions of the substring within the string. If the substring is not found, an empty list is returned. The function does not modify the input string or substring.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and element is a value of any type that may or may not be present in arr.
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices of the element in the list 'arr'. The list contains the position of 'element' in 'arr' if it exists, otherwise it returns an empty list. The indices are 0-based, meaning the first element in 'arr' is at index 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:Returns a list of 0-based indices of the specified element in the input list, including all occurrences. If the element is not found, an empty list is returned.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, index is a non-negative integer less than the length of the inner lists, and value is any type of value that can be compared to the elements of the inner lists.
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: The loop will return the first sub-list in `arr` where the element at `index` is equal to `value`, or `None` if no such sub-list is found.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no sub-list in `arr` has an element at `index` equal to `value`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function searches for the first sub-list in a given list of lists (`arr`) where the element at a specified index (`index`) matches a given value (`value`). It returns the entire sub-list if a match is found, otherwise it returns `None`.

#Function 7:

Additionally, `start` is less than or equal to `end`
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the range of `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end`, where `num` is a list containing integers `v` if `t` is 3 (which is the case here), and `t` is 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of integers. The function takes no parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9). The function uses the values of t and v to determine the range and the list of integers. If t is 1, it sets the start of the range to v. If t is 2, it sets the end of the range to v. If t is 3, it adds v to the list of integers. The function then counts the number of integers in the list that are within the specified range and returns the difference between the range and the count, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. If the start of the range is greater than the end, the function returns 0.
