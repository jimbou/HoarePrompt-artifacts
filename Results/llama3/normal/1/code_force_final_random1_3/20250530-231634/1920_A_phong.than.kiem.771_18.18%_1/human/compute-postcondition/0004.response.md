Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is 0, the current value of `t` is 1, and `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the current value of `v` is greater than `start`.**
