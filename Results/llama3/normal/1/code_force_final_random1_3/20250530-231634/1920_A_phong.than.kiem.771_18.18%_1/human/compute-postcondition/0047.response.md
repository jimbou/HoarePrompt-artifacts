Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least two integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the second element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop skips to the next iteration and `count_num` remains 1. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented to 2.***
