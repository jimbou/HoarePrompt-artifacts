Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `num` is a list containing the integer `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-7` lines if `t` is 3, otherwise it contains `n-6` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 2 or 3, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3, `start` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is set to the minimum of its original value and `v` if `t` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to be equal to `v`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same number of lines, and the values of `n`, `num`, `i`, `v`, `t`, and `end` are still within their respective ranges.
