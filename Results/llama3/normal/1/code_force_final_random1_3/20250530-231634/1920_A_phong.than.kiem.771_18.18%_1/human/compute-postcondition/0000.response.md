Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, num is an empty list, stdin contains n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9).**

The code first reads an integer n from stdin, which is between 2 and 100. The value of n is assigned to the variable n. The second line initializes the variable start to -1, and the third line initializes the variable end to 1000000000.0. The fourth line creates an empty list num. The remaining lines in stdin contain n lines, each with two integers t and v, where t is between 1 and 3, and v is between 1 and 10^9.
