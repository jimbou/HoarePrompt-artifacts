Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integer `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-4` lines if `t` is 3, otherwise it contains `n-3` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 1 or 2, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3, and if `t` is 2, then `end` is set to the minimum of its original value and `v`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `start`, `num`, `i`, and `v` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 3, and the value of `end` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `v` if `t` is 2. The number of lines in `stdin` is reduced by 1, and the remaining lines still contain two integers `t` and `v` with the same constraints.
