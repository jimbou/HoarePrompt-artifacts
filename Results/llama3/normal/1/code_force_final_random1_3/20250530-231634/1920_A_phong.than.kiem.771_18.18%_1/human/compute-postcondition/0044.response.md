The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `num`.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num` has at least one integer `v`, `i` is the first element in `num`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least two integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the second element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is 1**
