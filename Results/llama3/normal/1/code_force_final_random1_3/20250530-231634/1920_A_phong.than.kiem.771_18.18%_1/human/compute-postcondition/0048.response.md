The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list  num, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, num has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing at least three integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the third element in `num`, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is 3, `count_num` is 2**
