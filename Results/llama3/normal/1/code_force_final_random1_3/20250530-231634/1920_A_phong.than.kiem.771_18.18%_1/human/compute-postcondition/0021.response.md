Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `num` is a list containing the integer `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-4` lines if `t` is 3, otherwise it contains `n-3` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 1 or 2, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3, `end` is set to `v`, and if `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. Otherwise, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `t` is not 1, then `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `end` is updated to be equal to `v`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `num` still contains the integer `v` if `t` is 3, and is empty otherwise. The number of lines in `stdin` remains the same, with each line containing two integers `t` and `v`. The values of `n`, `i`, `v`, and `t` are unchanged. The value of `start` is still dependent on the value of `t` and `v`.
