Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where Alex has n constraints on what the integer k can be. There are three types of constraints: k must be greater than or equal to some integer x, k must be less than or equal to some integer x, and k must be not equal to some integer x. The program needs to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints.

Function 1 (func_1) reads the number of test cases from the input and returns this value. Function 2 (func_2) is not used in the given code snippet, but it appears to be a utility function for reading input lines and processing them based on certain conditions. Function 3 (func_3) is also not used in the given code snippet, but it seems to be a utility function for concatenating strings. Function 4 (func_4) is not used in the given code snippet, but it appears to be a utility function for finding the indices of a substring within a string. Function 5 (func_5) is not used in the given code snippet, but it seems to be a utility function for finding the indices of a specified element in a list. Function 6 (func_6) is not used in the given code snippet, but it appears to be a utility function for finding a sub-list in a list of lists based on a specified index and value. Function 7 (func_7) is the main function that solves the problem.

Function 7 (func_7) reads the number of constraints (n) and then reads each constraint. It maintains the start and end of the range based on constraints of type 1 and 2, and it maintains a list of integers that k must not be equal to based on constraints of type 3. After reading all constraints, it counts the number of integers in the list that are within the specified range and returns the difference between the range and the count, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. If the start of the range is greater than the end, the function returns 0.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given Python program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
