Output State: **The program returns the difference between the range of `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the number of elements in `num` that are within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` is a float between 1 and 10^9, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end`, where `num` is a list containing integers `v` if `t` is 3 (which is the case here), and `t` is 3.**
