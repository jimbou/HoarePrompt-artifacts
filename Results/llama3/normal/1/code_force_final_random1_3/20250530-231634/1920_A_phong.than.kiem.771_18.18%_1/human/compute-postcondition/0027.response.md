Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `num` is a list containing the integer `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-7` lines if `t` is 3, otherwise it contains `n-6` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 2 or 3, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is set to the minimum of its original value and `v` if `t` is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `v`, and `t` are updated based on the input from `stdin`. The list `num` is also updated if `t` is 3. The number of lines in `stdin` is decreased by 1. The values of `start` and `end` are updated based on the value of `t`.
