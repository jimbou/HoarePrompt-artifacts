Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `num` is a list containing the integer `v`, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 0 or 1, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `t` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to include the integer `v`, which was previously not part of the list. The number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1, as one line has been processed. The values of `n`, `start`, `i`, `v`, and `t` remain unchanged.
