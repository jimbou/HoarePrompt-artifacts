This function takes a boolean value `space` and another boolean value `to_int` as input, reads a line of input from stdin, and processes it based on the values of `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, it splits the input line into strings based on spaces; otherwise, it treats the input line as individual characters. If `to_int` is True, it converts the processed items into integers; otherwise, it leaves them as strings or characters. The function then returns the resulting list of integers, strings, or characters.
