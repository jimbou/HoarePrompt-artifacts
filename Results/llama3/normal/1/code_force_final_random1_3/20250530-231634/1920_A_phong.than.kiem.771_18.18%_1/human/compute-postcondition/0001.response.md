According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that it will start from 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is 0**
