Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 3, `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains `n-1` lines because one line has been read and processed. The variables `t` and `v` have been assigned the values of the two integers from the first line of the input, which are between 1 and 3, and between 1 and 10^9, respectively.
