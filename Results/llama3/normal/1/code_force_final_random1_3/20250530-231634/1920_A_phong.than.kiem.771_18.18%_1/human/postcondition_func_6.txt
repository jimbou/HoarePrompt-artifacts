This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of integers. The function takes no parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9). The function uses the values of t and v to determine the range and the list of integers. If t is 1, it sets the start of the range to v. If t is 2, it sets the end of the range to v. If t is 3, it adds v to the list of integers. The function then counts the number of integers in the list that are within the specified range and returns the difference between the range and the count, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. If the start of the range is greater than the end, the function returns 0.
