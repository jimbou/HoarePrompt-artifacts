Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is either -1 or an integer between 1 and 10^9, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `n-1` or `n-2` lines, each containing two integers `t` and `v` (1 <= `t` <= 3, 1 <= `v` <= 10^9), `i` is either 0 or 1, and `v` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The current value of `t` is 2. Additionally, the value of `end` is greater than the value of `v`.***
