Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is `k` + 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is 2. If `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1 or `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` - 1. If `i` is not in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is equal to `newk` + 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is equal to `newk` + 1. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is more than `newk`, then `aOnes` is equal to `aOnes` + 1, and `bOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and the current value of `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, and 'yes' is printed**
