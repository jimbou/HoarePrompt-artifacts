Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, the current value of `i` is 1, the current value of `t` is 3, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`.***
