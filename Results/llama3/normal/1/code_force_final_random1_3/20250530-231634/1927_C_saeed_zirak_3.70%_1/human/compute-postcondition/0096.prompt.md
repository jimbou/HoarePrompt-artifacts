Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is 1, stdin is empty, t is 2
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `t` is 2. If `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1 or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` + 1. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is more than `newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `t` are integers and lists as described in the precondition. If `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1 or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1 or 2. If `i` is not in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either `aOnes` + 1 or more than `newk` + 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is more than `newk`, then `aOnes` is either `aOnes` + 1 or `aOnes` is more than `newk` + 1, and `bOnes` is either 1 or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `t` are integers and lists as described in the precondition. If `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is 1 or 2 and `bOnes` is greater than 1 or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1 or 2 or 3. If `i` is not in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either `aOnes` + 1 or more than `newk` + 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1 or 2 or 3. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is more than `newk`, then `aOnes` is either `aOnes` + 1 or `aOnes` is more than `newk` + 1, and `bOnes` is either 1 or 2 or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than or equal to `i` + 1. Either `aOnes` or `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in both `a` and `b`, otherwise, if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
