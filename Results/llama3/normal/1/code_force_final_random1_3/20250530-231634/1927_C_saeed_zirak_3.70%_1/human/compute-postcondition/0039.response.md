Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` + 2. If `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` + 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then either `i` is not in `b` or if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` + 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
