Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, aOnes is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or greater than 3, bOnes is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or greater than 3, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is k + 1, stdin is empty. If both aOnes and bOnes are equal to newk, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is k + 1, stdin is empty, t is 2. If i is in both list a and list b, then either aOnes is equal to bOnes or aOnes is equal to bOnes + 1 or aOnes is equal to bOnes - 1. If i is not in both list a and list b, then either i is not in a or i is not in b. If i is in a and aOnes is less than or equal to newk, then aOnes is equal to newk + 1. If i is in b and bOnes is less than or equal to newk, then bOnes is equal to newk + 1. Otherwise, either i is not in b or bOnes is more than newk, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If i is in a and aOnes is more than newk, then aOnes is equal to aOnes + 1, and bOnes is equal to bOnes + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Either aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk and 'yes' is printed, or aOnes is not equal to newk or bOnes is not equal to newk and 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `k` plus 1, `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, then `aOnes` equals the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `bOnes` equals the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then either `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, or `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes`. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`, and 'no' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
