Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is greater than 0, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is 2. The current value of `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`. The current value of `aOnes` is less than the current value of `bOnes`.***
