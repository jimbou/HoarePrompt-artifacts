The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t, so it needs to be adjusted to t is greater than 0 and t is now 1.
State: **stdin contains an integer t that is greater than 0, t is 1**
