You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is k + 1, stdin is empty, t is 2. If i is in both list a and list b, then either aOnes is equal to bOnes or aOnes is equal to bOnes + 1 or aOnes is equal to bOnes - 1. If i is not in both list a and list b, then either i is not in a or i is not in b. If i is in a and aOnes is less than or equal to newk, then aOnes is equal to newk + 1. If i is in b and bOnes is less than or equal to newk, then bOnes is equal to newk + 1. Otherwise, either i is not in b or bOnes is more than newk, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If i is in a and aOnes is more than newk, then aOnes is equal to aOnes + 1, and bOnes is equal to bOnes + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Either aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk and 'yes' is printed, or aOnes is not equal to newk or bOnes is not equal to newk and 'no' is printed.
```
for t in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
