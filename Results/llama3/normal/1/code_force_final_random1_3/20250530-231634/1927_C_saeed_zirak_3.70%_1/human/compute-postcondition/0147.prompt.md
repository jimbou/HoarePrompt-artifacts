Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is 1, t is 3, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 3, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is larger than 0 and less than or equal to `newk`. If `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `t` are integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `stdin` is empty. If `i+1` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i+1` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is larger than 0 and less than or equal to `newk`. If `i+1` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i+1` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i+1` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i+1` is not in `a` or `i+1` is not in `b`. `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `t` are integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `stdin` is empty. If `i+1` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either 1, 2 or 3. If `i+1` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is larger than 0 and less than or equal to `newk`. If `i+1` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i+1` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i+1` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i+1` is not in `a` or `i+1` is not in `b`. `i` is increased by 1 and k must be greater than or equal to the current value of i. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either 2 or 3. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i+1` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i+1` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is larger than 0 and less than or equal to `newk`. If `i+1` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, or `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i+1` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i+1` is not in `a` or `i+1` is not in `b`. `i` is increased by 1 and k must be greater than or equal to the current value of i.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
