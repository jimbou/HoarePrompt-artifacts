#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        aOnes = 0
        
        bOnes = 0
        
        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                if aOnes < bOnes:
                    aOnes += 1
                else:
                    bOnes += 1
            elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        
        if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: t is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is k + 1, stdin is empty, aOnes is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or greater than 3, bOnes is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or greater than 3. If both aOnes and bOnes are equal to newk, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on certain conditions. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer t, followed by t test cases, each consisting of three integers n, m, and k, and two lists of integers a and b. It then checks if it's possible to make aOnes and bOnes equal to newk (k divided by 2) by incrementing aOnes or bOnes based on the presence of certain numbers in lists a and b. If both aOnes and bOnes can be made equal to newk, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving stdin empty.
