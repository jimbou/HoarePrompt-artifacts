The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is 2. For the loop to execute again, t must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is k + 1, stdin is empty, t is 3**
