Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `t` are integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either 2 or 3. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i+1` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i+1` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is larger than 0 and less than or equal to `newk`. If `i+1` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, or `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i+1` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i+1` is not in `a` or `i+1` is not in `b`. `i` is increased by 1 and k must be greater than or equal to the current value of i.**
