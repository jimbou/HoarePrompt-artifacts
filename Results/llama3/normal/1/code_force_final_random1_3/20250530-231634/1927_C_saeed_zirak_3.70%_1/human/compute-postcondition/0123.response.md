Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 3, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is larger than 0 and less than or equal to `newk`. If `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
