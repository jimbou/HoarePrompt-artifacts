Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 2. If `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1 or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 2. If `i` is not in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` + 1. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is more than `newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 2. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
