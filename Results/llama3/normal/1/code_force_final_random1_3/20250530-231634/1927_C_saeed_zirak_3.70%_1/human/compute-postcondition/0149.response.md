Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `k` plus 1, `aOnes` is equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is equal to `newk`. The current value of `aOnes` equals the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `bOnes` equals the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then either `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, or `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes`. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`.***
