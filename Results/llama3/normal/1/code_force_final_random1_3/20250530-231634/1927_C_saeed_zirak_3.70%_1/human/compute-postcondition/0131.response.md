Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will exit the current loop or if statement and continue with the next line of code.
