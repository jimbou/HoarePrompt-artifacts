Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is 2. The current value of `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1.**
