Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `t` are integers and lists as described in the precondition. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is either `aOnes` + 1 or more than `newk` + 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is either 2 or more than `newk` + 1. If `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1 or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1 or 2. If `i` is not in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` + 1. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is more than `newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
