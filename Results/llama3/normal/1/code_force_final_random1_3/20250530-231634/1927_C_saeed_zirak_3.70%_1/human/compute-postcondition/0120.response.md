Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 3, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is larger than `newk`. Either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
