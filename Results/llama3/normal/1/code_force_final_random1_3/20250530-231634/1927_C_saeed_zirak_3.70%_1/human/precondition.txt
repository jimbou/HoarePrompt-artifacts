The input contains a series of test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) — the length of array a, the length of array b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) — the elements of array a. The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, …, b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6) — the elements of array b.
