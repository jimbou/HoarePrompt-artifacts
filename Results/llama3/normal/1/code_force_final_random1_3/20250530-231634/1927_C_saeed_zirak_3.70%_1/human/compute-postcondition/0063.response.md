The value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. Therefore, the new value of `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` + 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` + 1, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is 2. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. The current value of `i` is in `a`.**
