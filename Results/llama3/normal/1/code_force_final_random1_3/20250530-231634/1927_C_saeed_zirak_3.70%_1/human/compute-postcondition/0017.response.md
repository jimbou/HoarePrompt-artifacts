Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
