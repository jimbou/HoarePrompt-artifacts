Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `b`, `newk`, `t` are integers and lists as described in the precondition. If `i` is in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is 2 and `bOnes` is greater than 1 or `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 1 or 2. If `i` is not in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either `aOnes` + 1 or more than `newk` + 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is more than `newk`, then `aOnes` is either `aOnes` + 1 or `aOnes` is more than `newk` + 1, and `bOnes` is either 1 or `bOnes` is more than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than or equal to `i` + 1, `aOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables keep their initial values except for `aOnes` which is increased by 1. The conditions related to `i`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, and `k` are still valid.
