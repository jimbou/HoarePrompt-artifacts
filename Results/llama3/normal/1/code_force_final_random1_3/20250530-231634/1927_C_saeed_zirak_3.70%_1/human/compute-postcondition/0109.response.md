Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, the current value of `i` is 1, the current value of `t` is 3, `aOnes` is less than or equal to the current value of `bOnes`, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`.**

The value of `aOnes` has been incremented by 1, but its previous value was less than the current value of `bOnes`, so now `aOnes` is either less than or equal to `bOnes`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
