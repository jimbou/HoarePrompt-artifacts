Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is 2. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is more than `newk`. Either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`***
