Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `i`, `t` are integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is larger than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` plus 1. If `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In either case, if `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`.***
