Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 3, `stdin` is empty. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is larger than 0 and less than or equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
