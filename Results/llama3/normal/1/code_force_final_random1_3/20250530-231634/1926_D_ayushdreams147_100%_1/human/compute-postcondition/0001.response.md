The only variable in the loop head is variable num and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 number the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31, res is 0, count is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 number and the num is the first number in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31 that must have at least 1 number, res is 0, count is an empty dictionary, num is the first number in the list**
