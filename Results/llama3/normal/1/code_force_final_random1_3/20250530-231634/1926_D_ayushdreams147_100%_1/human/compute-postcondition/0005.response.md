Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31 that must have at least 1 number, `res` is 0, `count` is a dictionary where the value of the key `num` is decreased by 1 and `num` is the first number in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the key `num` in the dictionary `count` is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` non-negative integers less than 2^31, and `num` is still the first number in the list. The variable `res` is still 0.
