Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, u2vs is a list of lists of length n, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have an additional element, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `u2vs` is modified by appending `v` to the list at index `u` and `u` to the list at index `v`. The `stdin` remains empty as no input is provided.
