Output State: **`n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of lists of length previous[path_ba[-1]], where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have additional elements, `d` is a dictionary, `a` is an integer, `previous` is a dictionary, `b` is an integer, `path_ba` is a list containing the integers b, n, n, n, ..., n, where n is the value of previous[path_ba[-1]] and is repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and path_ba must have at least 1 element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (c, i), (c, i), and (c, i), `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of path_ba and is at least 1, `c` is an integer equal to the middle element of path_ba, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(c, i)`, where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
