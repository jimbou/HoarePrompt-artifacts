Output: **`n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of lists of length previous[path_ba[-1]], where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have additional elements, `d` is a dictionary, `a` is an integer, `previous` is a dictionary, `b` is an integer, `path_ba` is a list containing the integers b, n, n, n, ..., n, where n is the value of previous[path_ba[-1]] and is repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (c, i) repeated ci + 1 times, where `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba`, `c` is an integer equal to the middle element of `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`. Otherwise, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (c1, i) and (c2, i) for all i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2), where `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and the following is printed: a series of lines, each containing a string in the format '{c + 1} {i}', where c and i are the elements of the tuples in the ops list, and the length of ops (where length of ops is the length of the ops list)**
