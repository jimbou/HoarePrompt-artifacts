Output State: **`n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of lists of length previous[path_ba[-1]], where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have additional elements, `d` is a dictionary, `a` is an integer, `previous` is a dictionary, `b` is an integer, `path_ba` is a list containing the integers b, n, n, n, ..., n, where n is the value of previous[path_ba[-1]] and is repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `ops` is an empty list.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `ops` is introduced, which is an empty list. The other variables retain their original values and properties as described in the initial state.
