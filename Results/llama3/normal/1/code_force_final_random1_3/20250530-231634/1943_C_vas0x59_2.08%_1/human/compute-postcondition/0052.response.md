Functionality: **This function reads a tree with n vertices from standard input, where n is a positive integer, and each edge is represented by two vertices u and v. It then performs a series of operations on the tree, including breadth-first searches and path constructions. The function ultimately prints the length of a list of operations and the operations themselves, where each operation is a tuple of two integers. The function returns None.**
