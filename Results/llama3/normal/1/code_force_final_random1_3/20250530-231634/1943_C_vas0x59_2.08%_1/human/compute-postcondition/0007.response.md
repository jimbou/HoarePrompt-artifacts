Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, u2vs is a list of lists of length n, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have additional elements, stdin contains no input**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be the same as the initial value, but it can be any integer greater than or equal to 0. The list `u2vs` will have the same length as `n`, and each index `u` and `v` will contain the corresponding values, with additional elements appended to both lists. The stdin will be empty, indicating that all input has been consumed by the loop.
