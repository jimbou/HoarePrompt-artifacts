Output State: **`n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of lists of length previous[path_ba[-1]], where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have additional elements, `d` is a dictionary, `a` is an integer, `previous` is a dictionary, `b` is an integer, `path_ba` is a list containing the integers b, n, n, n, ..., n, where n is the value of previous[path_ba[-1]] and is repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and path_ba must have at least 1 element, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, i), `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of path_ba and is at least 0, `c` is an integer equal to the middle element of path_ba, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `ops` now contains the tuple `(c, i)`, where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
