Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is -1, u2vs is a list of lists of length previous[path_ba[-1]], where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have additional elements, d is a dictionary, a is an integer, previous is a dictionary, b is an integer, path_ba is a list containing the integers b, n, n, n, ..., n, where n is the value of previous[path_ba[-1]] and is repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, ops is an empty list, ci is an integer equal to half the length of path_ba, c is an integer equal to the middle element of path_ba.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of lists of length previous[path_ba[-1]], where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have additional elements, `d` is a dictionary, `a` is an integer, `previous` is a dictionary, `b` is an integer, `path_ba` is a list containing the integers b, n, n, n, ..., n, where n is the value of previous[path_ba[-1]] and is repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and path_ba must have at least 1 element, `ops` is a list containing the tuple (c, i), `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of path_ba and is at least 0, `c` is an integer equal to the middle element of path_ba, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of lists of length previous[path_ba[-1]], where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have additional elements, `d` is a dictionary, `a` is an integer, `previous` is a dictionary, `b` is an integer, `path_ba` is a list containing the integers b, n, n, n, ..., n, where n is the value of previous[path_ba[-1]] and is repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and path_ba must have at least 1 element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (c, i) and (c, i), `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of path_ba and is at least 1, `c` is an integer equal to the middle element of path_ba, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of lists of length previous[path_ba[-1]], where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, and both lists have additional elements, `d` is a dictionary, `a` is an integer, `previous` is a dictionary, `b` is an integer, `path_ba` is a list containing the integers b, n, n, n, ..., n, where n is the value of previous[path_ba[-1]] and is repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and path_ba must have at least 1 element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (c, i), (c, i), and (c, i), `ci` is an integer equal to half the length of path_ba and is at least 1, `c` is an integer equal to the middle element of path_ba, `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
