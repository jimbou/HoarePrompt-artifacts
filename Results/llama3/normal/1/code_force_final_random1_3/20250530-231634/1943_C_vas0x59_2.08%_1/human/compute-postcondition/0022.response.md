Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of lists of length `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, where the list at index `u` contains `v` and the list at index `v` contains `u`, and both lists have additional elements, `d` is a dictionary, `a` is an integer, `previous` is a dictionary, `b` is an integer, `path_ba` is a list containing the integers `b`, `n`, and `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, and `path_ba` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
