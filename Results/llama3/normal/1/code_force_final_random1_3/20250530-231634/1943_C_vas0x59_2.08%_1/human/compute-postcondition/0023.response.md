Postcondition: ***`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of lists of length `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, where the list at index `u` contains `v` and the list at index `v` contains `u`, and both lists have additional elements, `d` is a dictionary, `a` is an integer, `previous` is a dictionary, `b` is an integer, `path_ba` is a list containing the integers `b`, `n`, and `n`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
