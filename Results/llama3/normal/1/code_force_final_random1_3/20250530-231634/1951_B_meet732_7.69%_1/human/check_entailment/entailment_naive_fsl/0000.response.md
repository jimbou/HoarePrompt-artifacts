Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case when the cow's rating is not the highest in the list. It also does not correctly calculate the maximum number of wins when the cow's rating is swapped with another cow's rating.

For example, if the input is `n = 5, k = 3, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `3`. This is because the cow with rating `3` can win against the cow with rating `2` and then against the cow with rating `4`, and finally against the cow with rating `5`.

The program also does not correctly handle the case when the cow's rating is the highest in the list. In this case, the cow can win against all other cows, but the program will output `n - 1` instead of `n`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
