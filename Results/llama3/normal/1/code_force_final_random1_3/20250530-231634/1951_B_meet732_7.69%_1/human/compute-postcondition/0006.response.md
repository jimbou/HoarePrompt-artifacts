Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The current value of `x` is the `k`th element of the first list of integers in `a`. The current value of `c` is 2. The current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `ind` is a list containing the value of `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `x`, `c`, `i`, and `ind` remain unchanged.
