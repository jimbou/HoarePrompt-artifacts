Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. If the current value of x is less than the ith element of the first list of integers in a, then ind is a list containing the value of i, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, and c is 3. If a[i] > x, then ind is a list containing the value of i, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, c is 4, i is increased by 1, and n is greater than i. In all cases, i is increased by 1 and n is greater than i. If c is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.**
