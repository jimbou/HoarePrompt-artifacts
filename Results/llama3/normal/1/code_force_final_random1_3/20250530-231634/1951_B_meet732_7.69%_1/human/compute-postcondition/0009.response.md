Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. ind is a list containing the value of i. x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a. c is 3. i is increased by 1 and n is greater than i.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ind` is updated to include the current value of `i`. The value of `x` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `c` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is still greater than `i`.
