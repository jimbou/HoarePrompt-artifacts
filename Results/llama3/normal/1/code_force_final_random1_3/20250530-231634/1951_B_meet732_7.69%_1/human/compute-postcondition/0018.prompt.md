Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, ind is an empty list, c is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The current value of `x` is the `k`th element of the first list of integers in `a`. If `c` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues execution with the current values of `a`, `x`, `c`, `i`, and `ind`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. If the current value of x is less than the ith element of the first list of integers in a, then ind is a list containing the value of i, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, and c is 3. In all cases, i is increased by 1 and n is greater than i. If c is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. If the current value of x is less than the ith element of the first list of integers in a, then ind is a list containing the value of i, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, and c is 3. If a[i] > x, then ind is a list containing the value of i, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, c is 4, i is increased by 1, and n is greater than i. In all cases, i is increased by 1 and n is greater than i. If c is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
