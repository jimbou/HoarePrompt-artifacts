Functionality: **This function determines the minimum number of cows that need to be removed from a list of Cowdeforces ratings to make the kth cow the highest rated. The function takes a list of integers as input, where the first element represents the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function returns the minimum number of cows that need to be removed, which can be either the number of cows with higher ratings than the kth cow, or the number of cows between the kth cow and the next highest rated cow. If there are no cows with higher ratings than the kth cow, the function returns the total number of cows minus 1.**
