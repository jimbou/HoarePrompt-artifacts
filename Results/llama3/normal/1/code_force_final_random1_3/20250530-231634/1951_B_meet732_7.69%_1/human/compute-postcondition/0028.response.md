Output State: **The program returns k - 1, where k is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), and n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the program returns the value of k minus 1. We know that k is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), where n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive). This means that the returned value will be an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive).
