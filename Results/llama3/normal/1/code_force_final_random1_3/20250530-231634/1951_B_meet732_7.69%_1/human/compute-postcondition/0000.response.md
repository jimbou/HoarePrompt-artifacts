Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, ind is an empty list, c is 0.**

The code snippet assigns the kth element of the first list of integers in `a` to `x`, creates an empty list `ind`, and initializes `c` to 0. The value of `a` remains unchanged, as it is only used to access its elements. The variables `ind` and `c` are newly introduced and have no previous values.
