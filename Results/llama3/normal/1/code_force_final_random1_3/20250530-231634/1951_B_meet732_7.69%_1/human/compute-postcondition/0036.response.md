Postcondition: ***a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The current value of x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a. If c is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues execution with the current values of a, x, c, i, and ind. Additionally, if k is equal to 14, the value of ind is printed. ind is not an empty list, has more than one element, and the first element of ind is not equal to 0. k is less than or equal to ind[1].***
