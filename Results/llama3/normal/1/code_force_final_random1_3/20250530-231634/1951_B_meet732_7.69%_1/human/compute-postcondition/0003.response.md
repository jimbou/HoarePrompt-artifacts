Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, ind is a list containing the value of i, c is 1, i is 0, and the current value of a[i] is greater than x.**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `ind` and `c`. The `ind` list now contains the value of `i`, which is 0. The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `a` is still a list of integers, where the first element is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers containing two integers `n` and `k` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The value of `x` is still the kth element of the first list of integers in `a`. The value of `i` is still 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is still greater than `x`.
