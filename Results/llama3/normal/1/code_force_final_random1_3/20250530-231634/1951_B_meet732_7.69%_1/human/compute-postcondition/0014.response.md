Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, ind is a list containing the value of i, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, c is 4, i is increased by 1, and n is greater than i.**

In this output state, the list `a` remains unchanged, still containing the test cases and their respective integers. The list `ind` now contains the value of `i`, which was appended to it. The value of `x` is still the kth element of the first list of integers in `a`. The variable `c` has been incremented by 1, making it 4. The variable `i` has been increased by 1, and `n` is still greater than `i`.
