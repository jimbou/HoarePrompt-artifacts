Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between the second element of the list 'ind' minus 1 and the value of 'k' minus 1. The value of 'k' is between 1 and n (1 ≤ k ≤ n), where n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The list 'ind' has more than one element and its first element is 0. If 'k' is equal to 14, the value of 'ind' is printed.**
