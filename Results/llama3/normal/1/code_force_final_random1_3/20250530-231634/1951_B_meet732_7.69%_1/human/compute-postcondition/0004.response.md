Postcondition: **a is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are lists of integers, where each list contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, x is the kth element of the first list of integers in a, if the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing the value of i, c is 1, and i is 0. Otherwise, ind remains an empty list, c remains 0, and i remains 0.**
