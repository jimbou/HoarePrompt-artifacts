Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

Here's why:

* The program first calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and adds `m` to it. This gives the maximum time at which a firework can be visible in the sky.
* If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and both `a` and `b` are not equal to 1, it means that both installations will launch fireworks at the same time, and the maximum number of fireworks visible will be the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation plus 1 (because the first firework launched by each installation will be visible for `m+1` minutes).
* Otherwise, the maximum number of fireworks visible will be the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where `a` or `b` is 1, and where `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`.

Correctness: **True**
