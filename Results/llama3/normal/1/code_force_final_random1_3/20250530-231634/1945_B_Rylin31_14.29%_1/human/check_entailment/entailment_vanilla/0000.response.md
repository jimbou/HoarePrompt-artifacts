Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program takes three inputs: a, b, and m, which represent the frequency of launching for the first installation, the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky, respectively.

The program first calculates the minimum of a and b and adds m to it, which represents the time when the first firework from both installations will be visible in the sky. Then, it checks if m is divisible by both a and b, and if a and b are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it means that the fireworks from both installations will be visible in the sky at the same time, and the program prints the sum of the number of fireworks from both installations that will be visible in the sky, plus 1.

If the condition is not true, it means that the fireworks from both installations will not be visible in the sky at the same time, and the program prints the sum of the number of fireworks from both installations that will be visible in the sky.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
