Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, m is an integer, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. If m is divisible by both a and b, and both a and b are not equal to 1, then the expression mn // a + mn // b + 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of mn by a and the integer division of mn by b is printed.***
