The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of three integers from stdin to `a`, `b`, and `m`, respectively. The second line assigns the value of the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m` to `mn`. 

Since `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned new values from stdin, their initial values are overwritten. The value of `mn` is updated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, m is an integer, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m**
