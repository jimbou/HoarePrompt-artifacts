Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic is as follows:

- The program first calculates the minimum time interval between two consecutive fireworks from the same installation, which is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. This is because the fireworks are visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch, so the next firework from the same installation can be launched after `m` minutes.

- If `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by dividing the minimum time interval by `a` and `b` and adding 1. This is because in this case, the fireworks from both installations will be visible for one minute at the same time.

- Otherwise, the program simply calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by dividing the minimum time interval by `a` and `b`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where `a` or `b` is 1, and where `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`. Therefore, the program is correct.
