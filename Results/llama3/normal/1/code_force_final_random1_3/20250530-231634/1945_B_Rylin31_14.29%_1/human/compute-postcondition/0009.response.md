Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, m is an integer, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. If m is divisible by both a and b, and both a and b are not equal to 1, then the expression mn // a + mn // b + 1 is printed, where mn // a and mn // b are the integer divisions of mn by a and b respectively, and 1 is added to the sum of these two divisions. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of mn by a and the integer division of mn by b is printed.**
