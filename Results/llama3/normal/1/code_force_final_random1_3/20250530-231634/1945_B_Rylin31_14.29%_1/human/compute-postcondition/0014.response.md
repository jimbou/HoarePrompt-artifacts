The code prints the sum of the integer division of `mn` by `a` and the integer division of `mn` by `b`. Here, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, where `a` and `b` are integers and `m` is also an integer.

Output: **the sum of the integer division of (the minimum of a and b plus m) by a and the integer division of (the minimum of a and b plus m) by b**
