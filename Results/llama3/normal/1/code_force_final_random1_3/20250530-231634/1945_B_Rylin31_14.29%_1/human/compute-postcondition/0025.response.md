Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It calculates the minimum of a and b plus m, and then prints the sum of the integer divisions of this minimum value by a and b. If m is divisible by both a and b, and both a and b are not equal to 1, it adds 1 to the result before printing. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.**
