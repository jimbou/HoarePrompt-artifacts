The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer accepted from the input, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t sets of three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). The value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input. Since stdin now contains t sets of three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), the output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t sets of three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18).
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t sets of three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
