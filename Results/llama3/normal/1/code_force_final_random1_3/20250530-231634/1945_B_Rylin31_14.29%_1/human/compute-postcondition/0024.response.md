Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, i is t, a is an integer, b is an integer, m is an integer, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. If m is divisible by both a and b, and both a and b are not equal to 1, then the expression mn // a + mn // b + 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of mn by a and the integer division of mn by b is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be between 0 and 10^4 inclusive (since it started between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and the loop decrements it), `i` will be equal to `t` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `t`), and `a`, `b`, and `m` will still be integers. The value of `mn` will be the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. The loop will print either the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `b` plus 1 (if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1), or just the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `b`.
