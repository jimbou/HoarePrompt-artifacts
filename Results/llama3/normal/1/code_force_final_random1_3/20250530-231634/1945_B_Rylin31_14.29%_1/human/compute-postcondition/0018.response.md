Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, i is 2, a is an integer, b is an integer, m is an integer, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `t` and `i`, so they remain unchanged. The `map` function is used to assign the integer values of the input to `a`, `b`, and `m`. The `mn` variable is assigned the value of the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. The code does not contain any conditional statements or loops that would affect the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `m`. Therefore, the final state of the program includes the original values of `t` and `i`, and the updated values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn`.
