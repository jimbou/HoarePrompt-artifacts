Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

The program first calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, which represents the time when the first firework from the first installation and the first firework from the second installation will be visible in the sky.

Then, it calculates the sum of the integer divisions of this minimum value by `a` and `b`, which represents the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

The program also handles the special case where `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and both `a` and `b` are not equal to 1. In this case, it adds 1 to the result before printing, because in this case, one firework from the first installation and one firework from the second installation will be visible in the sky at the same time.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the example inputs and outputs are consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
