Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` sorts the monsters by their distance from the character and then iterates over them, firing bullets at the closest monsters first. If a monster is killed, it is removed from the list. The function returns `False` if a monster reaches the character before it can be killed, and `True` otherwise.

The main function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

I have analyzed the code and couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when a monster is already at the character's position, or when there are multiple monsters at the same distance.

The use of the `sorted` function with a custom key function to sort the monsters by their distance is a good approach, and the iteration over the sorted list is efficient. The use of the `min` function to calculate the number of bullets to fire at each monster is also correct.

Overall, the program is well-structured, efficient, and accurate, and I couldn't find any case where it does not work as expected.
