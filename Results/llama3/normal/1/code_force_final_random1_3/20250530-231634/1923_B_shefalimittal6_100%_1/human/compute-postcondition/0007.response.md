To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, we need to understand the function `func_1(a, x, k)` and its return value based on the given precondition.

The precondition states that `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `stdin` is empty, and `t` is greater than 1. However, the value of `t` is not relevant to the print statement as it is not used in the function call.

The function `func_1(a, x, k)` is not defined in the given code snippet, so we can't directly determine its return value. However, based on the structure of the print statement, we can infer that `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a boolean value (True or False).

If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns True, the print statement will output 'YES'. If it returns False, the print statement will output 'NO'.

Since we don't have the definition of `func_1(a, x, k)`, we can't provide an exact output. However, we can describe the output based on the return value of the function.

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, 'NO' if func_1(a, x, k) returns False**
