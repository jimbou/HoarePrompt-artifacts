The code prints 'YES' if the function `func_1(a, x, k)` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function `func_1(a, x, k)` is not defined in the given code snippet, so we can't determine its exact behavior. However, based on the precondition, we know that `a` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is a list of `n` integers, and `k` is an integer.

Output: **YES if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, otherwise NO**
