This function takes as input a list of positive integers `a`, a list of non-zero integers `x`, and a positive integer `k`, where the lengths of `a` and `x` are equal. It modifies the list `a` by iteratively reducing the values of its elements based on the sorted absolute values of the elements in `x` and the value of `k`. The function returns `True` if it successfully iterates through all elements in `a` without encountering an element in `x` with an absolute value equal to the current distance, and `False` otherwise. The function also returns `True` if it successfully iterates through all elements in `a` without encountering an element in `x` with an absolute value equal to the current distance, and `False` otherwise.
