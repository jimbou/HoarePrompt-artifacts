The code prints 'YES' if the function `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Since the exact implementation of `func_1(a, x, k)` is not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`.

Output: **YES or NO (depending on the return value of func_1(a, x, k))**
