The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state is not affected by this code, except that the input is consumed. The input is not specified in the initial state, so we assume it is empty after the code is executed.

Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `x` is a list of non-zero integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer, and `len(a) = len(x) = n`.**
