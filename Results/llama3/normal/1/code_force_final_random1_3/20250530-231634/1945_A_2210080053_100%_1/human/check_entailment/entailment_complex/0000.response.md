Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains three integers a, b, and c.

2. For each test case, the program calculates the sum of b and c, which represents the total number of extroverts and universals.

3. The program then checks if the number of universals (c) is less than the remainder of the sum (b + c) divided by 3. If this condition is true, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents with extroverts, and the program prints -1.

4. If the condition is false, the program calculates the minimum number of tents needed by subtracting the integer division of the negative sum (b + c) by 3 from the number of introverts (a). This is because each tent can accommodate up to 3 people, and the program is trying to fill the tents with extroverts and universals first.

5. The program processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.

Correctness: **True**
