#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
        
        b += c
        
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
        
    #State: a is an integer equal to the first integer in the last line of the file object open(0), b is an integer equal to the sum of the second and third integers in the last line of the file object open(0), c is an integer equal to the third integer in the last line of the file object open(0), stdin contains multiple lines of input, open(0) is a file object that must have at least t+1 lines where t is the integer in the first line of the file object open(0), s is the last line of the file object open(0), and this is printed: either (a - -b // 3) or -1 depending on whether c is less than b % 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains three integers a, b, and c. For each test case, it calculates the sum of b and c, and then prints either the result of a minus the integer division of the negative sum by 3, or -1, depending on whether c is less than the remainder of the sum divided by 3. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
