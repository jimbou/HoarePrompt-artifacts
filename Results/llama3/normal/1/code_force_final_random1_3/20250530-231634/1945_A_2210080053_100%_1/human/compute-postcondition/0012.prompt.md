Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
    b += c
    print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a, b, and c are integers equal to the first, second, and third space-separated integers of the second line of the file object open(0), respectively, b is equal to its original value plus c, stdin contains multiple lines of input, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 2 lines, s is the second line of the file object open(0), and this is printed: a tuple containing either (a - -b // 3, -1) or (-1,) depending on whether c is less than b % 3

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is an integer equal to the first integer in the third line of the file object open(0), b is an integer equal to the second integer in the third line of the file object open(0) plus the third integer in the third line of the file object open(0), c is an integer equal to the third integer in the third line of the file object open(0), stdin contains multiple lines of input, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 3 lines, s is the third line of the file object open(0), and this is printed: either (a - -b // 3) or -1 depending on whether c is less than b % 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is an integer equal to the first integer in the fourth line of the file object open(0), b is an integer equal to the sum of the second and third integers in the fourth line of the file object open(0) plus the third integer in the fourth line of the file object open(0), c is an integer equal to the third integer in the fourth line of the file object open(0), stdin contains multiple lines of input, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 4 lines, s is the fourth line of the file object open(0), and this is printed: a minus negative b divided by 3, if c is less than b modulo 3, otherwise -1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
