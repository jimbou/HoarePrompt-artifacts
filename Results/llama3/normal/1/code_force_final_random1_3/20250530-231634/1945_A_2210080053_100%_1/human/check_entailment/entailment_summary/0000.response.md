Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly parses the three integers a, b, and c from the input line.
3. The program then calculates the total number of extroverts and universals by adding b and c. This is correct because universals can be treated as extroverts when calculating the number of tents needed.
4. The program then checks if the number of universals (c) is less than the remainder of the total number of extroverts and universals (b + c) divided by 3. If this condition is true, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, and the program correctly prints -1.
5. If the condition is false, the program calculates the minimum number of tents needed by subtracting the integer division of the negative total number of extroverts and universals by 3 from the number of introverts (a). This is correct because each introvert needs a separate tent, and the remaining tents can be filled with extroverts and universals.
6. The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its execution summary matches the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
