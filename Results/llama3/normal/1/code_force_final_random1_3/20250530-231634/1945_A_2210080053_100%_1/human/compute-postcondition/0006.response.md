To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the third line of the file object `open(0)`.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the sum of the second and third integers in the third line of the file object `open(0)`.
   - `c` is an integer equal to the third integer in the third line of the file object `open(0)`.
   - `s` is the third line of the file object `open(0)`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The expression `-b // 3` calculates the integer division of `-b` by `3`. This will give a negative integer value because `-b` is negative.
   - `a - -b // 3` subtracts the result of `-b // 3` from `a`. Given that `-b // 3` is negative, this operation effectively adds a positive value to `a`.
   - `b % 3` calculates the remainder of `b` divided by `3`.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` checks if `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by `3`.
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)` is a tuple containing two values. The first value is the result of `a - -b // 3`, and the second value is `-1`.
   - The syntax `[(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]]` uses the condition `c < b % 3` to select an element from the tuple. If `c < b % 3` is `True`, it selects the first element (`a - -b // 3`); if `False`, it selects the second element (`-1`).

3. **Output**:
   - The output will be either `a - -b // 3` or `-1`, depending on the condition `c < b % 3`.
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `a - -b // 3` or determine the outcome of the condition `c < b % 3`.
   - However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the calculated value of `a - -b // 3` or `-1`, depending on the relationship between `c` and the remainder of `b` divided by `3`.

Output: **Either (a - -b // 3) or -1, where a is the first integer in the third line of the file object open(0), b is the sum of the second and third integers in the third line, and c is the third integer in the third line, depending on whether c is less than the remainder of b divided by 3.**
