The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the third line of the file object `open(0)`, which is stored in the variable `s`. The second line increments the value of `b` by the value of `c`.

Output State: **a is an integer equal to the first integer in the third line of the file object open(0), b is an integer equal to the second integer in the third line of the file object open(0) plus the third integer in the third line of the file object open(0), c is an integer equal to the third integer in the third line of the file object open(0), stdin contains multiple lines of input, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 3 lines, s is the third line of the file object open(0)**
