Output: **a is an integer equal to the first integer in the fourth line of the file object open(0), b is an integer equal to the sum of the second and third integers in the fourth line of the file object open(0) plus the third integer in the fourth line of the file object open(0), c is an integer equal to the third integer in the fourth line of the file object open(0), stdin contains multiple lines of input, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 4 lines, s is the fourth line of the file object open(0), and this is printed: a minus negative b divided by 3, if c is less than b modulo 3, otherwise -1**
