Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains three integers a, b, and c. For each test case, it calculates the sum of b and c, and then prints either the result of a minus the integer division of the negative sum by 3, or -1, depending on whether c is less than the remainder of the sum divided by 3. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
