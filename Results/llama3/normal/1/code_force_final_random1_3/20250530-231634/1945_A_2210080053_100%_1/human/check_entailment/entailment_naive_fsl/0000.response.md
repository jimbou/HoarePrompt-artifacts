Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It first reads the input and splits it into three integers: `a` (introverts), `b` (extroverts), and `c` (universals).
2. It then adds the number of universals to the number of extroverts, effectively treating universals as extroverts. This is because universals can accommodate any option, including living with two others.
3. The program then calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts (including universals) by dividing the total number of extroverts by 3 and rounding up to the nearest integer. This is done using the expression `-b // 3`, which is equivalent to `math.ceil(b / 3)`.
4. The program then checks if the number of universals is less than the remainder of the division of the total number of extroverts by 3. If this is the case, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, and the program outputs -1.
5. Otherwise, the program outputs the minimum number of tents needed, which is the sum of the number of introverts and the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts (including universals).

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When there are no extroverts or universals, the program outputs the number of introverts.
* When there are no introverts, the program outputs the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts (including universals).
* When there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents, the program outputs -1.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
