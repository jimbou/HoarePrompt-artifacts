Output State: **a is an integer equal to the first integer in the last line of the file object open(0), b is an integer equal to the sum of the second and third integers in the last line of the file object open(0), c is an integer equal to the third integer in the last line of the file object open(0), stdin contains multiple lines of input, open(0) is a file object that must have at least t+1 lines where t is the integer in the first line of the file object open(0), s is the last line of the file object open(0), and this is printed: either (a - -b // 3) or -1 depending on whether c is less than b % 3.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the variables a, b, and c will have the values of the first, second, and third integers in the last line of the file object open(0), respectively. The value of b will be the sum of the second and third integers in the last line of the file object open(0). The variable s will be the last line of the file object open(0). The loop will print either (a - -b // 3) or -1 depending on whether c is less than b % 3. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
