Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p`, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `x` must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `a` converted to integers appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `b` converted to integers appended to it, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, `i` is 1, `y` is the first element in the list `b`. `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index max_p to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `y` has reached the value of `max_p`, and `custo` has accumulated the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`. The list `custos` contains the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p` to `max_p - 1`, plus the sum of `b_values` from index 1 to `max_p - 1` if the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p - 1` to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list.
