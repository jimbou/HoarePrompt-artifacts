Postcondition: ***`a` is a list, `x` is greater than 1, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 1, `b` is a list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `y` is `max_p` - 1. If `y` is 1, `a` is an empty list and `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p` to `max_p` - 1, plus the sum of `b_values` from index 1 to `max_p` - 1, plus `b_values[y]` plus `a_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p` to `max_p` - 1, plus the sum of `b_values` from index 1 to `max_p` - 1, plus `b_values[y]`.***
