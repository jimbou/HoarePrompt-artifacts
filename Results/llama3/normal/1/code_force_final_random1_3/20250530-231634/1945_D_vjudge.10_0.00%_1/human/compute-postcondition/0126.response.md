Output State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes all strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is the last string in `b`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the list `b` is empty, and the list `b_values` contains all the strings from `b` converted to integers. The variable `y` is the last string in `b`, and the list `custos` contains all the integers from `a_values` except the one at index `y`, where `y` is the smallest index such that the sum of the integer at index `y-1` in `a_values` and the integer at index `y` in `b_values` is greater than the integer at index `y` in `a_values`. The list `custos` also contains an additional element `custo`, which is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus the integer at index `y` in `a_values`.
