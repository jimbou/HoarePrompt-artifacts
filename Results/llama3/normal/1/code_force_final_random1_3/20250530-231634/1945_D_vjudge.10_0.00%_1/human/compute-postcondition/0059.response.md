Output State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element in the list `a`, `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers with the first element of `a` converted to an integer appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `a_values` now has an additional element, which is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
