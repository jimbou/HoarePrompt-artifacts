Output State: **`custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, plus the sum of `b_values` from index 1 to `max_p - 1` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p - 1` to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and `x` additional elements `custo` have been appended to the end of the list and must have at least `len(custos)` elements, `c` is the last element in the list, and the last element in the list which is `c` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `custos` has been fully traversed and all its elements have been printed. The list `custos` still contains the same elements as before, which are either the sum of minimum values between `a_values` and `b_values` plus the sum of `b_values` if a certain condition is met, or all integers in `a_values` except one, plus additional elements `custo`. The variable `c` now holds the last element of the list `custos`, which is being printed.
