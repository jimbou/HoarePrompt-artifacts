Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the first four integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers that must have at least 3 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the third integer in the list `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b_values` has been updated to include the third integer in the list `b`, which is `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before, since one test case has been processed.
