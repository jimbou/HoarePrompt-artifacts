To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`.

The only variables in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. If `y` is greater than `max_p - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, and `max_p` is an integer. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by 1 (since the step is -1), and `num_fila` and `max_p` remain the same.

State: **`a` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `x` must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `a` converted to integers appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `b` converted to integers appended to it, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, `i` is 1, `y` is the second last element in the list `b`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is `custo + b_values[y]`. `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 2 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list.**
