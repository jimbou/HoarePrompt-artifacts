To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `y` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to ensure it has at least one element.

The state of `y` is not explicitly defined before the loop, so we can assume it will take the value of the first element in `a` during the first iteration.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `y` is the first element in `a`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.**
