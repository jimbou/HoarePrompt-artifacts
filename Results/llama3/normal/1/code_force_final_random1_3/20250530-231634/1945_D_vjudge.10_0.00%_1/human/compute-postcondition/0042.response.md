The only variable in the loop head is variable  y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than 1. Since the loop iterates in reverse order (from `max_p - 1` to `0`), `y` must be 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is a list, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is 2**
