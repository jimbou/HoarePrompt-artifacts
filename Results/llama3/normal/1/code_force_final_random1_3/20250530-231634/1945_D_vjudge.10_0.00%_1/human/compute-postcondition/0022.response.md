Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is `b_values[y]`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is `num_fila - 1, and `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`**

The value of `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`, which is a specific value from the list `b_values`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `custo` is now equal to `b_values[y]`, which is a specific value from the list `b_values`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
