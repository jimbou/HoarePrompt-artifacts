The only variable in the loop head is variable `y` and list `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If the list `b` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in the list `b`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `b` must have at least 3 elements and `y` is the third element in the list `b`.
State: **`a` is an empty list, `y` is the third element in the list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `a` converted to integers appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers with the first element of `b` and the integer value of the second element of `b` appended to it, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements**
