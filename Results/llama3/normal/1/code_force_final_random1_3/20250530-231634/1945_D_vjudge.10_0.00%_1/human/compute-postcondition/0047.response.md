Postcondition: ***x is an integer greater than 0, custos is a list, i is 0, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to 1, max_p is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a_values is a list containing all integers in the list a, b_values is a list containing all integers in the list b, nf is a list containing two integers, a is a list of n space-separated integers, b is a list of n space-separated integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, y is 2. If a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y], then if y is 1, the first integer in a_values is added to custos. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], then custos has an additional value equal to the value of a_values at index y.***
