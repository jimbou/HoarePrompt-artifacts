To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `c` and `custos`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `custos` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `custos` has at least 1 element, and `c` is the first element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `custos` must have at least one more element, and `c` must be the next element in the list.

State: **`custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and x additional elements custo have been appended to the end of the list and must have at least 2 elements, c is the second element in the list**
