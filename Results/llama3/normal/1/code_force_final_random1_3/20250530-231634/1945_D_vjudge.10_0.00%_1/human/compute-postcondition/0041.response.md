Postcondition: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is a list, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is at least 1. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, plus `b_values[y]` if `y` is not 1, or plus `b_values[y]` and `a_values[0]` if `y` is 1. Otherwise, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, plus the element at index `y` in `a_values`.**
