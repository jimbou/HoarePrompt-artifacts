Output State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be at least 2, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes all strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is 2, `custo` is increased by `b_values[2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` still contains at least `len(a)` strings, `x` is still greater than 2, `max_p` is still an integer and at least 2, `num_fila` is still at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is still 2, `b` is still an empty list of strings, `nf` is still a list of strings, `a_values` still includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` still includes all strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is still 2, and `custo` has been increased by the value of `b_values` at index 2.
