Output State: **a is a list, x is greater than 1, max_p is an integer and must be greater than 2, num_fila is at least 2 greater than max_p, i is 1, b is a list of strings, nf is a list of strings, a_values is a list of integers, b_values is a list of integers, y is 1, custo is increased by the sum of a_values[0] and b_values[1].**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line increments the value of `custo` by `a_values[0]`, adding to the previous increase by `b_values[1]`. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

The initial state is preserved for all variables except `custo`, which is updated by adding `a_values[0]` to its previous value, which was already increased by `b_values[1]`.
