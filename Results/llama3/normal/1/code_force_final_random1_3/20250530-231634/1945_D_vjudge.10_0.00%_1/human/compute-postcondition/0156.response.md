Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be at least 2, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes all strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is 2. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[0] + b_values[2]` if `y` is 1, otherwise `custo` is increased by `b_values[2]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`.***
