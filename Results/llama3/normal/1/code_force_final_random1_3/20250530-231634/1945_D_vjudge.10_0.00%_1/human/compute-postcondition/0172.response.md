The only object in the loop head is variable  c and list  custos, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the custos.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, custos has at least 2 elements, c is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the c is the third element in the list.
State: **`custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and x additional elements custo have been appended to the end of the list and must have at least 3 elements, c is the third element in the list**
