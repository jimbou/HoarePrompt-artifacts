The only variable in the loop head is variable `y` and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `max_p`. If `max_p` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `y` is `max_p`. So for the loop to be executed  `max_p` must be at least 2 and `y` is `max_p - 1`.
State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be at least 2, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes all strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]` plus `a_values[y]` plus `a_values[y]` plus ... (num_fila - max_p - 1) times `a_values[y]`. If `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]` plus `b_values[y]` plus `b_values[y]` plus ... (num_fila - max_p - 1) times `b_values[y]`.**
