State: **`custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to `max_p` - 1, plus the sum of `b_values` from index 1 to `max_p` - 1 if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p` - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1**
