Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `y` is the last element in `a`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.
Code of the loop:
for y in b:
    b_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes the first string in `b` converted to an integer, `y` is the first string in `b`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes the first three strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is the second string in `b`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes the first five strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is the third string in `b`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
