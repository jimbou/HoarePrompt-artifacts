To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.


The loop head is `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`. The objects in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order.


The state of `num_fila` and `max_p` does not need to be adjusted, as they are not modified within the loop.


Therefore, the adjusted state is:


State: **`a` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `x` must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `a` converted to integers appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `b` converted to integers appended to it, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, `i` is 1, `y` is the third last element in the list `b`. `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 3 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`.**
