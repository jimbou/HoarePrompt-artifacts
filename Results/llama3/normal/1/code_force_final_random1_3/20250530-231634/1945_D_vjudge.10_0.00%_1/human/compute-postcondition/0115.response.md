To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `y` and the list `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, and `y` is the first element in `a`.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `y` must be the second element in `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes the first two elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `y` is the second element in `a`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.**
