Postcondition: ***`a` is a list, `x` is greater than 1, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 1, `b` is a list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `y` is 2. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p` to `max_p` - 1, plus the sum of `b_values` from index 1 to `max_p` - 1, plus `b_values[y]` plus `a_values[0]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, then `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list, where `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`, plus `b_values[y]`, and `custo` has been incremented by `a_values[0]`.***
