Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing the first integer in the list `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the first integer in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a_values` has been updated to include the first integer from the list `a`, which is also the value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged. The input from `stdin` has been reduced by one test case.
