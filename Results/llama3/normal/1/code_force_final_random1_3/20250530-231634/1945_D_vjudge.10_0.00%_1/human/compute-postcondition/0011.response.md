Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the first integer in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers that must have at least 1 integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the first integer in the list `b`.**

The code appends the first integer in the list `b` to the list `b_values`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before.
