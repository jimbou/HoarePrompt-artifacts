Output State: **`a` is a list, `x` is greater than 1, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 1, `b` is a list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by `b_values[1]`.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values, except for `custo`, which is incremented by the value of `b_values[1]`. The value of `custo` is now `custo + b_values[1]`.
