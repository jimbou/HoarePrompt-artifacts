To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `y` and `max_p`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `y` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 2.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to decrement `y` by 1, since the loop is iterating in reverse order.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`a` is a list, `x` is greater than 1, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 1, `b` is a list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `y` is 1**

Note that only the state of `y` has been adjusted, as it is the only object involved in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
