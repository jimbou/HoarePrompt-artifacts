The only variable in the loop head is variable  y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `y` is the third element in `a`.
State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes the first three elements in `a` as integers and the integer value of the second element in `a`, `b_values` is a list of integers, `y` is the third element in `a`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.**
