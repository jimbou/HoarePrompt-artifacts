Output State: **x is an integer greater than 0, custos is a list, i is 0, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to 1, max_p is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a_values is a list containing all integers in the list a, b_values is a list containing all integers in the list b, nf is a list containing two integers, a is a list of n space-separated integers, b is a list of n space-separated integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, y is at least 1 and equals 1, custo is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus b_values[y] plus a_values[0].**

The code adds the value of `a_values[0]` to `custo`, which is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, plus `b_values[y]`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
