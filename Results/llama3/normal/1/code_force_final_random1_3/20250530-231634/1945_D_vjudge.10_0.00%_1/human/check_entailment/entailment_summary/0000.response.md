Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the input data, calculates the minimum cost for each test case by comparing the corresponding elements in the two lines of integers, and sums the minimum values. The program also handles the condition where it needs to sum additional values. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading multiple test cases, calculating the minimum cost for each, and printing the results.


Correctness: **True**
