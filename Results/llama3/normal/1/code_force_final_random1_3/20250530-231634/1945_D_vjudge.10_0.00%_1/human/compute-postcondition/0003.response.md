According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, so we can adjust the state of `a` to have at least 1 integer and `y` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the first integer in the list `a`**
