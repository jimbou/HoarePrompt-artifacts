Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the last integer in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for y in b:
    b_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the first integer in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers that must have at least 1 integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the first integer in the list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the first three integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the second integer in the list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the first four integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers that must have at least 3 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the third integer in the list `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
