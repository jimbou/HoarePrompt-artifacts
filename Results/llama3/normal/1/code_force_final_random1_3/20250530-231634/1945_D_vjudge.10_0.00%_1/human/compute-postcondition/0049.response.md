The code `custo += b_values[y]` adds the value of `b_values[y]` to the list `custo`. Since `y` is 1, `b_values[y]` is the second element of the list `b_values`. The list `b_values` contains all integers in the list `b`, which is a list of n space-separated integers. Therefore, `b_values[y]` is the second integer in the list `b`.

The list `custo` is updated by adding the second integer in the list `b` to it.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custo` is a list containing the original elements plus the second integer in the list `b`, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is 1**
