The only objects in the loop head are variables  y, num_fila and max_p, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `y`, `num_fila` and `max_p`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `y` must be `num_fila - 3`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is `num_fila - 3**
