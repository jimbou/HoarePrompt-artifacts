This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two space-separated integers n and m, followed by two lines of n space-separated integers. It calculates the minimum cost for each test case by comparing corresponding elements in the two lines of integers and summing the minimum values. If a certain condition is met, it also sums additional values. The function then prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.
