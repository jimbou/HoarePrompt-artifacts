Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `x` must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `a` converted to integers appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `b` converted to integers appended to it, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, `i` is 1, `y` is the third last element in the list `b`. `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 3 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`. `custo` has been increased by `a_values[y]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `custo` has been increased by `a_values[y]`. This means that the list `custos` now contains an additional element, which is the sum of the previous value of `custo` and `a_values[y]`.
