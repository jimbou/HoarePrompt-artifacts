According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has at least 2 integers, `y` is the second integer in the list `b`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `b` must have at least 3 integers and `y` is the third integer in the list `b`. Also, `b_values` is a list containing the first three integers in the list `b`. 
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the first three integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers that must have at least 3 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the third integer in the list `b`.**
