Output State: **a is an empty list, y is max_p - 1, num_fila is at least 2 greater than max_p, max_p is an integer and must be greater than 1, x must be greater than 1, a_values is a list of integers with all elements of a converted to integers appended to it, b_values is a list of integers with all elements of b converted to integers appended to it, nf is a list of strings, b is a list of strings, i is 1, y is the first element in the list b, custos is a list containing all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list. custo is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p, plus a_values[y].**

The code adds the value of `a_values[y]` to `custo`, where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`. This means that `custo` now includes the value of `a_values[y]` in addition to the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to `max_p`. All other variables remain unchanged.
