Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: custos is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list, i is 1, x must be greater than 1, num_fila is an integer, max_p is an integer, a_values is a list of integers, b_values is a list of integers, custo is 0, nf is a list of strings, a is a list of strings, b is a list of strings.
Code of the loop:
for y in a:
    a_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element in the list `a`, `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers with the first element of `a` converted to an integer appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in the list `a`, `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers with the first element of `a` converted to an integer and the integer value of `y` appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element in the list `a`, `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of integers with the first element of `a` converted to an integer, the integer value of `y` appended to it and the integer value of `y` appended to it again, `b_values` is a list of integers, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
