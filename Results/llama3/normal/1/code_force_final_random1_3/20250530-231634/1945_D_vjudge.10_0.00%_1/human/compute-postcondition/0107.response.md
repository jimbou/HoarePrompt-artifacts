Output State: **a is a list, x is greater than 1, max_p is an integer and must be greater than 2, num_fila is at least 2 greater than max_p, i is 1, b is a list of strings, nf is a list of strings, a_values is a list of integers, b_values is a list of integers, y is 1, custo is an integer equal to its original value plus a_values[y].**

The code snippet increments the value of `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`, where `y` is 1. The value of `custo` is now its original value plus the second element of the list `a_values`. No other variables are affected by the code.
