To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `y` is greater than 0 and less than `max_p - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order (due to the `-1` step in the `range` function).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `y`, which should be decremented to 1.

The other variables in the state, such as `x`, `custos`, `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **x is an integer greater than 0, custos is a list, i is 0, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to 1, max_p is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a_values is a list containing all integers in the list a, b_values is a list containing all integers in the list b, nf is a list containing two integers, a is a list of n space-separated integers, b is a list of n space-separated integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, y is 1**
