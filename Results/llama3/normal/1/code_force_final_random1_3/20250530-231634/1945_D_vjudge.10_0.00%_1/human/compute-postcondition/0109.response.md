Output State: **`a` is a list, `x` is greater than 1, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 1, `b` is a list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `y` is 1. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p` to `max_p` - 1, plus the sum of `b_values` from index 1 to `max_p` - 1. If `y` is 1, then `custos` also includes `b_values[y]` plus `a_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custos` includes `b_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, then `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop will continue to execute until `y` is 1, at which point it will stop. The state of the variables not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
