Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is `max_p - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is a list, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is at least 1. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, plus `b_values[y]` if `y` is not 1, or plus `b_values[y]` and `a_values[0]` if `y` is 1. Otherwise, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, plus the element at index `y` in `a_values`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *x is an integer greater than 0, custos is a list, i is 0, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to 1, max_p is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a_values is a list containing all integers in the list a, b_values is a list containing all integers in the list b, nf is a list containing two integers, a is a list of n space-separated integers, b is a list of n space-separated integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, y is 2. If a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y], then if y is 1, the first integer in a_values is added to custos. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], then custos has an additional value equal to the value of a_values at index y.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *x is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is a list containing the original elements plus the second integer in the list `b` and the first integer in the list `a` if `y` is 1 and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, otherwise it contains all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y`. `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, y is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
