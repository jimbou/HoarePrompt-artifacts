Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is `num_fila - 3`. If `a_values` at index `y` is less than `b_values` at index `y`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values` at index `y`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y`.***
