Output State: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is the last integer in the list `b`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and all integers from list `b` have been appended to `b_values`. The value of `y` is now the last integer in list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
