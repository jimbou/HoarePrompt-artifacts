Output State: **x is an integer greater than 0, custos is an empty list, i is 0, custo is 0, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to 1, max_p is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a_values is an empty list, b_values is an empty list, nf is a list containing two integers, a is a list of n space-separated integers, b is a list of n space-separated integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `custos`, `i`, and `custo` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variables `num_fila` and `max_p` are assigned integer values from the first line of input, which are greater than or equal to 1. The lists `a_values` and `b_values` are empty, as they are not used in the code. The variables `nf`, `a`, and `b` are assigned values from the input, where `nf` contains two integers, and `a` and `b` contain lists of `n` space-separated integers. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been processed, leaving multiple test cases - 1.
