Output State: **a is an empty list, x is greater than 1, max_p is an integer and must be greater than 1, num_fila is at least 2 greater than max_p, i is 1, b is a list of strings, nf is a list of strings, a_values is a list of integers, b_values is a list of integers, custos is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index max_p to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1, plus b_values[y] plus a_values[0].**

The code block increments the value of `custos` by `a_values[0]`, adding this value to the existing sum of minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p` to `max_p - 1`, plus the sum of `b_values` from index 1 to `max_p - 1`, plus `b_values[y]`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code block.
