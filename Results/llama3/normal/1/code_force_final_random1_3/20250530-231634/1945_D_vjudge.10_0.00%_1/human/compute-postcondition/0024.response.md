To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

According to the loop statement, the loop will execute again if `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p`. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, which is greater than or equal to `max_p`.

To adjust the states, we need to decrease `y` by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order. Therefore, the new value of `y` is `num_fila - 2`.

The other variables in the loop head, `num_fila` and `max_p`, do not need to be adjusted, as their values do not change.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is `num_fila - 2`.**
