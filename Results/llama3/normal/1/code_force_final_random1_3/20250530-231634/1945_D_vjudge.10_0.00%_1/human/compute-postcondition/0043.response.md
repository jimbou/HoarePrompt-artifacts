Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is a list containing the sum of the integer at index 2 of `b_values` and its previous values, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `custos` has been updated to include the sum of the integer at index 2 of `b_values` (which is the third element of the list `b`) and its previous values. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
