Output State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be at least 2, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes all strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and two additional elements `custo` have been appended to the end of the list.**

In this output state, the list `custos` has been updated by appending an additional element `custo` to the end of the list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
