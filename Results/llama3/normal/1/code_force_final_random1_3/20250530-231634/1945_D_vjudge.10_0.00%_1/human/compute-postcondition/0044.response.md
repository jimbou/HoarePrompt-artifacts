Output State: **x is an integer greater than 0, custos is a list containing the sum of the integer at index 2 of b_values and its previous values plus the first integer in a_values, i is 0, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to 1, max_p is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a_values is a list containing all integers in the list a, b_values is a list containing all integers in the list b, nf is a list containing two integers, a is a list of n space-separated integers, b is a list of n space-separated integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, y is 2**

The code increments the value of `custos` by the first integer in `a_values`, but does not affect any other variables. The `break` statement does not have any impact on the variables.
