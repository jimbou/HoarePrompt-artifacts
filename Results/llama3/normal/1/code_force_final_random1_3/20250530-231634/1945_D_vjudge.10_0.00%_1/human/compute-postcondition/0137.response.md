To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`.

1. `y` is the loop variable, and its value will change in each iteration. Since the loop iterates in reverse order (due to the `-1` step), `y` will decrease by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `y - 1`.

2. `num_fila` and `max_p` are the bounds of the range, but they are not modified within the loop. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Based on this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes all strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]` plus `a_values[y]`. If `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]` plus `b_values[y]`.**
