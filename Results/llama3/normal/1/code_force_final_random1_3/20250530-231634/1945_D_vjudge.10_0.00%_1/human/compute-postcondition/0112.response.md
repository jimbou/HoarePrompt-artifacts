Output State: **a is a list of strings, x is greater than 2, max_p is an integer and must be greater than 1, num_fila is at least 2 greater than max_p, i is 2, b is a list of strings, nf is a list of strings, a_values is a list of integers, b_values is a list of integers, y is 1, custos is a list containing all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list. custo is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p, plus a_values[y].**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `x`, `max_p`, `num_fila`, `i`, `b`, `nf`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `y`, and `custos` have been updated according to the code. The value of `custo` has been calculated based on the values of `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. The list `custos` now contains all integers in `a_values` except the integer at index `y`, plus the additional element `custo`.
