To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `max_p`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `max_p`. If `max_p` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `y` is `max_p - 1`, so we need to adjust `y` to be at least 1 and `max_p` to be at least 2.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is at least 1**
