Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is a list containing the integer at index `num_fila - 2` in `b_values`, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is `num_fila - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `custos` has been updated to include the integer at index `num_fila - 2` in `b_values`. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
