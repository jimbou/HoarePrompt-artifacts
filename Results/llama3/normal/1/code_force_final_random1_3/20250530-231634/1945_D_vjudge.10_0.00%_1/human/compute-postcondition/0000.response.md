Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The second line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). x is an integer equal to the value of m from the first line of the first test case, custos is an empty list.**

The code reads the first line of the first test case from stdin, which contains two space-separated integers n and m, and assigns the value of m to the variable x. The variable custos is initialized as an empty list. The remaining lines of the first test case and all subsequent test cases remain in stdin.
