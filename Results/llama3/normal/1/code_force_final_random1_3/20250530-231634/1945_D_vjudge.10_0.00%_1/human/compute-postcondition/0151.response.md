The only variable in the loop head is variable  y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be at least 2, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes all strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is 2**
