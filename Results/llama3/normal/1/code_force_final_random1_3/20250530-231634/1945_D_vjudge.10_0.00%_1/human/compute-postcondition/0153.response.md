Output State: **a is a list of strings that must have at least len(a) elements, x is greater than 2, max_p is an integer and must be at least 2, num_fila is at least 2 greater than max_p, i is 2, b is an empty list of strings, nf is a list of strings, a_values is a list of integers that includes all elements in a as integers, b_values is a list of integers that includes all strings in b converted to integers, y is 2, custo is increased by a_values[0] + b_values[2].**

In this final state, the value of `custo` has been updated by adding the value of `a_values[0]` to its previous value, which was increased by `b_values[2]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the initial state.
