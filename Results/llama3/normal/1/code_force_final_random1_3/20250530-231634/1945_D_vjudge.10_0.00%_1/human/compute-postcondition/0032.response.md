Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integers in the list `b`, `nf` is a list containing two integers, `a` is a list of n space-separated integers, `b` is a list of n space-separated integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `y` is `max_p - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `custo` has been updated to be the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`. The value of `y` is now `max_p - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
