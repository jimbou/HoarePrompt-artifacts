Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p` - 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `a` converted to integers appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `b` converted to integers appended to it, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, `i` is 1, `y` is the first element in the list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index max_p to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1, plus b_values[y]. The current value of `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`.**

In this output state, the value of `custos` has been updated by adding `b_values[y]` to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]` is still valid.
