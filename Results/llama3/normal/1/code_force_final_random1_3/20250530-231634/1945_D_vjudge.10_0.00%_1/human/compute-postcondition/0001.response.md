The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9). The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n` (1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9). `x` is an integer equal to the value of `m` from the first line of the first test case, `custos` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed `x` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The second line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). x is an integer that must be greater than 0, custos is an empty list, i is 0**
