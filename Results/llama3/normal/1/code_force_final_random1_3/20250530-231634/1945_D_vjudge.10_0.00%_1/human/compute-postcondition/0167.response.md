The code prints the first element of the list `custos`.
Since the exact values of the elements in the list `custos` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of the first element. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first element of the list `custos`.
Output: **c (where c is the first element in the list custos)**
