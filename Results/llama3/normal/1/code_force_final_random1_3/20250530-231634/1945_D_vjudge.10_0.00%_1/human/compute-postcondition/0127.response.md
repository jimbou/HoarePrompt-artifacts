To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `num_fila - 1` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`. Since `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, we can conclude that `num_fila - 1` is at least 1 greater than `max_p - 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute.

To adjust the states, we need to set `y` to the initial value of the loop, which is `num_fila - 1`.

State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `x` is greater than 2, `max_p` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `i` is 2, `b` is an empty list of strings, `nf` is a list of strings, `a_values` is a list of integers that includes all elements in `a` as integers, `b_values` is a list of integers that includes all strings in `b` converted to integers, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `custos` is a list containing all integers in the list `a_values` except the integer at index `y` where `y` is the smallest index such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and an additional element `custo` has been appended to the end of the list. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p`, plus `a_values[y]`.**
