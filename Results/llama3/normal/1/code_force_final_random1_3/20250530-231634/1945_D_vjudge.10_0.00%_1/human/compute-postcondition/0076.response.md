Postcondition: ***`a` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `num_fila` is at least 2 greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `x` must be greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `a` converted to integers appended to it, `b_values` is a list of integers with all elements of `b` converted to integers appended to it, `custo` is 0, `nf` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, `custos` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus the sum of b_values from index 1 to max_p - 1 if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y] for all y from max_p - 1 to 1, otherwise it contains all integers in the list a_values except the integer at index y where y is the smallest index such that a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y], and an additional element custo has been appended to the end of the list, `i` is 1, `y` is the last element in the list `b`, and `a_values[y]` is not less than `b_values[y]`.***
