The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the string returned by `func_14()` to the standard output followed by a newline character. Since the string returned by `func_14()` is already printed to the standard output followed by a newline character in the initial state, this code does not change the output.

Output State: **`func_10()` returns at least 2, `func_14()` returns a string, and the string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character.**
