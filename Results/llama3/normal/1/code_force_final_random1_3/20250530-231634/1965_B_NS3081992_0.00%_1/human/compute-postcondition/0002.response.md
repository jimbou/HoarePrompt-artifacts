To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The only variable in the loop head is the implicit loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the state. However, we can infer that the loop variable is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value returned by `func_10()` is greater than the current loop iteration. Since the loop has already executed at least once, the value returned by `func_10()` must be at least 2.

State: **`func_10()` returns at least 2, `func_14()` returns a string, and the string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character.**
