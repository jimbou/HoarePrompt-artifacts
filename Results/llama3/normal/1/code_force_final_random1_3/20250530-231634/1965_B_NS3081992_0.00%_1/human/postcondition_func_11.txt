This function calculates the minimum rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd' based on the processing status of its associated values. If the key has only one associated value, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively checks the processing status of each associated value, updates the 'processing' list accordingly, and returns the minimum rank plus one. The function also updates the 'rank' list with the calculated minimum rank for the given key.
