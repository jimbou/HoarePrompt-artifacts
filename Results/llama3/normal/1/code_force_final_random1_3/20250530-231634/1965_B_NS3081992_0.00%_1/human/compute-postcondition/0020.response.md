Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and `l` is greater than `lk + 1`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk`, `i` is at least `lk + 2`, `ans` is a list containing 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk - 2), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, `2 * k + 2`, 2^(i - 1), 2^i**.

The code appends 2^i to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is at least `lk + 2`, so the new element added to `ans` is 2^i. The other variables remain unchanged.
