Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads the first line of input from the standard input (stdin) in binary mode, decodes it into a string using UTF-8 encoding, removes trailing bytes, and returns the resulting string.

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates the minimum rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd' based on the processing status of its associated values. If the key has only one associated value, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively checks the processing status of each associated value, updates the 'processing' list accordingly, and returns the minimum rank plus one. The function also updates the 'rank' list with the calculated minimum rank for the given key.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):

''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b).

    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function generates a sequence of integers based on the binary representation of two input integers, n and k. If k is 1 and n is not 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of integers containing powers of 2, k-1 minus the sum of previous powers of 2, k+1, 2k+1, and additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of n. The function then returns this list as a string of space-separated integers.

 Output hints for function15:  Prints a string to the standard output a specified number of times, with each print followed by a newline character. The string and the number of times it is printed are determined by external functions `func_14()` and `func_10()`, respectively.
