Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing 1, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and `lk` is at least 2, `i` is 0**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the value 1, which is the result of 2 raised to the power of `i` (which is 0). The other variables remain unchanged.
