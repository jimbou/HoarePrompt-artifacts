To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `lk`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `lk - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `lk` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `lk` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing 1, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and `lk` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
