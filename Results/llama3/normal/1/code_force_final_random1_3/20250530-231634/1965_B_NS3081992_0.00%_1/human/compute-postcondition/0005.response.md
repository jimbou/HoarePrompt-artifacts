Output State: **`func_10()` returns at least 3, `func_14()` returns a string, and the string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character, and the standard output now contains the string returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `func_14()` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character, which means that the standard output now contains this string followed by a newline character.
