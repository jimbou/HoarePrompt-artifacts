Output State: **`func_10()` returns a non-negative integer `n`, `func_14()` returns a string `s`, and the string `s` is printed to the standard output `n` times, each followed by a newline character.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the non-negative integer returned by `func_10()`. In each iteration, the string returned by `func_14()` will be printed to the standard output, followed by a newline character. After all iterations, the standard output will contain the string returned by `func_14()` repeated `n` times, each followed by a newline character.
