The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `lk` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `lk + 1`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is at least `lk + 2` and `l` must be greater than `lk + 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and `l` is greater than `lk + 1`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk`, `i` is at least `lk + 2`, `ans` is a list containing 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk - 2), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, `2 * k + 2`, 2^(i - 1)**
