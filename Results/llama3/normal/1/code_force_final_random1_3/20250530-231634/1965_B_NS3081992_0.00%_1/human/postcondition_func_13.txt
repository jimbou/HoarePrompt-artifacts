This function generates a sequence of integers based on the binary representation of two input integers, n and k. If k is 1 and n is not 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of integers containing powers of 2, k-1 minus the sum of previous powers of 2, k+1, 2k+1, and additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of n. The function then returns this list as a string of space-separated integers.
