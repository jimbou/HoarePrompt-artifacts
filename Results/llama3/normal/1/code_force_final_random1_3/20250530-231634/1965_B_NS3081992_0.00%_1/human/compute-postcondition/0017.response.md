To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(lk, l):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `lk` to `l-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least `lk`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The only object in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk`, `i` is at least `lk + 1`, `ans` is a list containing 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk - 2), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, `2 * k + 2`**

Note that the states of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`, and `ans` remain unchanged, as they are not involved in the loop head. Only the state of `i` is adjusted to reflect the increment by 1.
