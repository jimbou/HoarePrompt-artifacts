#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list of a specified length, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_7()'. The length of the list is determined by the input parameter 'rows', which is a positive integer. The function returns this list, without modifying the input parameter 'rows'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum rank of a given key 'da' in a dictionary 'd' based on the processing status of its associated values. If the key has only one associated value, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively checks the processing status of each associated value, updates the 'processing' list accordingly, and returns the minimum rank plus one. The function also updates the 'rank' list with the calculated minimum rank for the given key.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is zero, it returns x = 1, y = 0, and the original value of a. Otherwise, it recursively calls func_13 to compute the GCD and coefficients.
