Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk`, `i` is at least `lk`, `ans` is a list containing 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk - 2), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, `2 ** i`, `lk` is less than `l`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending `2 ** i` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still at least `lk`, and the relationship between `lk` and `l` remains the same.
