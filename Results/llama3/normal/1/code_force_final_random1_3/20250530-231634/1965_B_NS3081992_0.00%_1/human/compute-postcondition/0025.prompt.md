You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns a string '1\n2'
        #State: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. The current value of k is 1. n is not equal to 2.
    else :

        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))

    #State: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. If k is equal to 1, n is not equal to 2. If k is not equal to 1, l is greater than or equal to lk, bk is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, lk is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, i is equal to l - 1, ans is a list containing 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk - 2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 * k + 2, 2^(lk), 2^(lk + 1), ..., 2^(l - 1).
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. The current value of k is 1. n is not equal to 2.

Case_2: The program returns a string of space-separated integers, specifically the list 'ans', which contains the values 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk - 2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 * k + 2, 2^(lk), 2^(lk + 1), ..., 2^(l - 1), where lk is the number of digits in the binary representation of k, and l is the number of digits in the binary representation of n.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
