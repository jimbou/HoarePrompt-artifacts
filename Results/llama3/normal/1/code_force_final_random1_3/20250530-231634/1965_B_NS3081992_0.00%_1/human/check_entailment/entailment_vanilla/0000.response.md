Reasoning:  
The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where we need to find a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, but for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

The program defines several functions for reading input, but the main logic is in function func_14(). This function takes two integers n and k as input and constructs a sequence of numbers that meet the problem's conditions.

For k = 1, the function handles the special case where n = 2 separately and then constructs a sequence starting with 2 and 3, followed by powers of 2 up to 2^(l-1), where l is the number of bits in the binary representation of n.

For k > 1, the function constructs a sequence that includes powers of 2 up to 2^(lk-1), where lk is the number of bits in the binary representation of k. It then appends k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, and 2 * k + 1 to the sequence, followed by powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1).

The function func_15() is the main function that reads the number of test cases and calls func_14() for each test case.
