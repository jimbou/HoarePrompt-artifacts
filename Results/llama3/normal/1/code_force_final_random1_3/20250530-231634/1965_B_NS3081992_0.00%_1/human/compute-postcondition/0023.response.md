Postcondition: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. If k is equal to 1, n is not equal to 2. If k is not equal to 1, l is greater than or equal to lk, bk is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, lk is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, i is equal to l - 1, ans is a list containing 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk - 2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 * k + 2, 2^(lk), 2^(lk + 1), ..., 2^(l - 1).**
