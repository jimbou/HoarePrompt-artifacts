To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. This means the loop will execute as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used within the loop body, so we don't need to worry about its state.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `func_10()` returns at least 2.
- `func_14()` returns a string, and the string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we only need to consider the objects in the loop head, which are the result of `func_10()` and the throwaway variable `_`. However, since `_` is not used, we only need to focus on the result of `func_10()`.

For the loop to execute again, the value returned by `func_10()` must be greater than the current iteration count. Since `func_10()` returns at least 2 and we are at the end of the previous iteration, it means we have already executed the loop at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return at least 3.

State: **`func_10()` returns at least 3, `func_14()` returns a string, and the string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character.**
