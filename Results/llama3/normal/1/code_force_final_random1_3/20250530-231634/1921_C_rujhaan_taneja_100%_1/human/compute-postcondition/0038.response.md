Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The current value of `i` is 0. Additionally, the first element of `arr` is less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated to include the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `arr` is still less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`.
