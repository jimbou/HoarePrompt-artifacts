Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is 2, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the first element in `arr` and `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `array2` has been updated to include the product of the first element in `arr` and `a`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
