Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`, and `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.**

In this output state, the code has appended the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` to `array2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `array2` and `feat` is now always true, as the first element of `arr` is multiplied by `a` and appended to `array2`, and `feat` is updated with the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
