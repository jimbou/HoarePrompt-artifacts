Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == 0:
            if arr[0] < b / a:
                array2.append(arr[0] * a)
        elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a positive integer greater than 0, i is a positive integer equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order. If the first element of arr is less than b divided by a, then array2 is a list containing one element which is the first element of arr multiplied by a. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of arr is less than the ratio of b to a, then array2 is a list containing one or more elements which are the products of the differences between consecutive elements of arr and a. Otherwise, array2 remains an empty list. feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b. If the sum of array2 plus the product of n minus the length of array2 and b is less than f, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is `n`, `array2` is a list containing elements which are the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if the difference is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is equal to `n`, `array2` is a list containing the products of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` and `a` that are less than `b/a`, and the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
