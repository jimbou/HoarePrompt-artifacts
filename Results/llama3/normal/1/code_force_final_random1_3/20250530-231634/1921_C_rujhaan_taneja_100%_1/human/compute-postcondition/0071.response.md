Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than n+1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b, `i` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list containing one positive integer less than `b`. Otherwise, `array2` remains empty.***
