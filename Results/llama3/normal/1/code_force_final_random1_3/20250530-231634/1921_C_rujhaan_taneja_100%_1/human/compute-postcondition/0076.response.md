Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 0, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one positive integer less than `b`; otherwise, `array2` remains empty. If `i` is not equal to 0, then if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing the product of this difference and `a`; otherwise, `array2` remains empty.**
