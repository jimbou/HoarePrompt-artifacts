The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 0 and the first element in `arr` is less than `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the first element in `arr` and `a`. If `i` is 1 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list, `i` is 2**
