The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `test_cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `test_cases` must be greater than `n+1`. 
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than n+1, `i` is a positive integer equal to n+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order. If the first element of `arr` is less than `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one or more elements which are the products of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list. `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
