#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] < b / a:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: test_cases is 0, stdin contains no test cases, n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b, i is equal to n, array2 is a list containing the products of the differences between consecutive elements of arr and a that are less than b/a, and the product of the first element of arr and a if the first element of arr is less than b/a. If the sum of the elements in array2 plus the product of n minus the length of array2 and b is less than f, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers in ascending order. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the products of the differences between consecutive elements and a, if the difference is less than b/a, and the product of the first element and a if the first element is less than b/a. If this sum plus the product of n minus the count of these products and b is less than f, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates.
