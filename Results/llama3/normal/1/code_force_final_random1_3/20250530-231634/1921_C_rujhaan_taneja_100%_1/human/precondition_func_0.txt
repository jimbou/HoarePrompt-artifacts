stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.
