Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is increased by 1, `array2` is a list containing one positive integer less than `b` or the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is 0, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` has an additional element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is not 0, then if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, the last element of `array2` is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. If the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` also contains the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, the last element of `array2` is updated to be the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`.***
