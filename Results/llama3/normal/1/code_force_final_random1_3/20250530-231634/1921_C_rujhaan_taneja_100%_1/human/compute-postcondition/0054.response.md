Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is 2, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a`.**

The code appends the product of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a` to `array2`. Since `i` is 2, the difference is between the elements at indices 2 and 1 in `arr`. The value of `array2` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
