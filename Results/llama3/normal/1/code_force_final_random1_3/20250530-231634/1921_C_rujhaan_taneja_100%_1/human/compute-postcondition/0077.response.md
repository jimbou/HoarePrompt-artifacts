The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is increased by 1, `array2` is a list containing one positive integer less than `b` or the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`**
