Postcondition: **test_cases is a positive integer greater than 0, i is a positive integer equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order. If the first element of arr is less than b divided by a, then array2 is a list containing one element which is the first element of arr multiplied by a. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of arr is less than the ratio of b to a, then array2 is a list containing one or more elements which are the products of the differences between consecutive elements of arr and a. Otherwise, array2 remains an empty list. feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b. The current value of the sum of array2 plus the product of n minus the length of array2 and b is less than f.**
