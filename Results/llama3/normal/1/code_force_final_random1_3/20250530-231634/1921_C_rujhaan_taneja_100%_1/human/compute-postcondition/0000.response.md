Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.**

The code `test_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines of input, the value of `test_cases` is the number of test cases. The remaining input in stdin is still the same, containing multiple test cases, each with two lines of input.
