Output State: **test_cases is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, array2 is an empty list, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin contains one less test case because two lines of input have been consumed. The variables `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` have been assigned values from the first line of the test case. The variable `arr` has been assigned a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order from the second line of the test case. The variable `array2` has been initialized as an empty list. The variable `feat` has been assigned a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
