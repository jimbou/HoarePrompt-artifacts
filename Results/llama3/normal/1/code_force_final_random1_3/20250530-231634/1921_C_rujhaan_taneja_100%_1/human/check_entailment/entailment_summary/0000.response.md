Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program iterates over each test case, calculates the total charge spent based on the given conditions, and prints "Yes" if the total charge spent is less than the initial charge, and "No" otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the difference between consecutive messages is less than b/a, and when the first message is less than b/a. It also correctly calculates the total charge spent by summing up the products of the differences and a, and adding the product of n minus the count of these products and b.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs as described in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
