State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 1, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a` if the difference is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`, otherwise `array2` remains an empty list.**
