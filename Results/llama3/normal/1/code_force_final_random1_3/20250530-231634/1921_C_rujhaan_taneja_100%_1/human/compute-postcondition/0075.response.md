Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is not equal to 0. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list containing the product of this difference and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains empty.***
