Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, array2 is an empty list, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order. If `i` equals 0, and the first element of `arr` is less than `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`, and `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is not equal to 0, and the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)th` element of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)th` element of `arr` and `a`, and `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order. If `i` equals 1 and the first element of `arr` is less than `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`, and `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is not equal to 1 and the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)th` element of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)th` element of `arr` and `a`, and `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is an integer increased by 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order. If `i` equals 0, then `array2` is a list containing two elements: the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`, and the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`, and `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i` equals 2 and the first element of `arr` is less than `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`, and `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to 2 and the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)th` element of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)th` element of `arr` and `a`, and `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
