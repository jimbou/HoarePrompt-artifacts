Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is equal to `n`, `array2` is a list containing the products of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` and `a` that are less than `b/a`, and the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`. The current value of the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`.**
