Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than n+1, `i` is not equal to 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a`, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b. The current value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code appends the product of the difference between the current element and the previous element in the array `arr` and the value of `a` to the list `array2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The difference between the current element and the previous element in `arr` is still less than `b` divided by `a`.
