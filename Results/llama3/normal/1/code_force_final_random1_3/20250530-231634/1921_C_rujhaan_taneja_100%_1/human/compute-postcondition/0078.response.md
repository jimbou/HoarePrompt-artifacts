Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is increased by 1, `array2` is a list containing one positive integer less than `b` or the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`, and `array2` has an additional element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `array2`, which has been appended with a new element. This new element is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, including `test_cases`, `n`, `stdin`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `feat`, and `i`.
