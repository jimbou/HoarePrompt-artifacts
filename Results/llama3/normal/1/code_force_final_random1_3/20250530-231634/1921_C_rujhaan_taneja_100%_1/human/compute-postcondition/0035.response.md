To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than n+1, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, `array2` is an empty list, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b**
