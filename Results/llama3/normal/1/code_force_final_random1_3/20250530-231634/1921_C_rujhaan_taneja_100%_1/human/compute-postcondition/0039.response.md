Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`, otherwise `array2` is an empty list, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The current value of `i` is 0.***
