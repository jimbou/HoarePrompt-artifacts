Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is an integer increased by 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)th` element of `arr` and `a`, and `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.**

In this output state, the code has appended a new element to the `array2` list, which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)th` element of `arr` and `a`. The `feat` list remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected.
