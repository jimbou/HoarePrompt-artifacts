The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `test_cases` must be greater than `n+1`.
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is `n+1`, `array2` is a list containing elements which are the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if the difference is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
