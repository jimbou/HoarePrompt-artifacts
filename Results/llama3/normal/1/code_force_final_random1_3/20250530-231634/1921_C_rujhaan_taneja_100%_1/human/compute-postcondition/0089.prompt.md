Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a positive integer greater than n+1, n is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b, i is n+1, array2 is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 0, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one positive integer less than `b`; otherwise, `array2` remains empty. If `i` is not equal to 0, then if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing the product of this difference and `a`; otherwise, `array2` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is increased by 1, `array2` is a list containing one positive integer less than `b` or the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is 0, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` has an additional element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is not 0, then if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, the last element of `array2` is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is increased by 1, `array2` is a list containing one positive integer less than `b` or the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is 0, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` has an additional element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is not 0, then if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, the last element of `array2` is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. If the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` also contains the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, the last element of `array2` is updated to be the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
