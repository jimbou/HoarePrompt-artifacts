To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `array2` is an empty list, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`**
