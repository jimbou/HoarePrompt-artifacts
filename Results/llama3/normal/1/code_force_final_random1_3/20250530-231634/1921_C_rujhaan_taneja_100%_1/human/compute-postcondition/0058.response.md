Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is `n`, `array2` is a list containing elements which are the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if the difference is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`. The current value of the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`.***
