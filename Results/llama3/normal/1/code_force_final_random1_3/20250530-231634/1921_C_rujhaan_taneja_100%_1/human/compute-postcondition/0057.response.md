Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is `n`, `array2` is a list containing elements which are the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if the difference is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `stdin`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `feat` remain unchanged. The loop variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `array2` now contains elements that are the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a`, but only if the difference is less than the value of `b` divided by `a`. If the difference is not less than `b/a`, the corresponding element is not included in `array2`.
