Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` equals 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, the first element of `arr` is less than `b` divided by `a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated to include the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`. The first element of `arr` is less than `b` divided by `a`, so the first element of `array2` is less than `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
