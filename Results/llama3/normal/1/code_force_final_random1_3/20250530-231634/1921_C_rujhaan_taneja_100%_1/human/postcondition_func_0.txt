This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers in ascending order. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the products of the differences between consecutive elements and a, if the difference is less than b/a, and the product of the first element and a if the first element is less than b/a. If this sum plus the product of n minus the count of these products and b is less than f, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates.
