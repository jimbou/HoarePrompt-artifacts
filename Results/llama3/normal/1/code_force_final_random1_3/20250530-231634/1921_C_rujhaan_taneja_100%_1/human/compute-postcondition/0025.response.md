Output State: **test_cases is a positive integer greater than 0, i is a positive integer equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order. If the first element of arr is less than b divided by a, then array2 is a list containing one element which is the first element of arr multiplied by a. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of arr is less than the ratio of b to a, then array2 is a list containing one or more elements which are the products of the differences between consecutive elements of arr and a. Otherwise, array2 remains an empty list. feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The number of test cases, the input stream, the number of elements in the array, the frequency, the coefficients a and b, and the array itself remain unchanged.
* The loop counter i is equal to the number of elements in the array n.
* The array2 contains the products of the differences between consecutive elements of arr and a, if these differences are less than the ratio of b to a. If the first element of arr is less than b divided by a, then array2 contains the first element of arr multiplied by a. Otherwise, array2 remains an empty list.
* The list feat contains the same four positive integers: n, f, a, and b.
