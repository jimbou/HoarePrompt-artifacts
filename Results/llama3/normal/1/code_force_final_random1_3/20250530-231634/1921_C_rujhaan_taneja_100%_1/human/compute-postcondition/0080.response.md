Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is increased by 1, `array2` is a list containing one positive integer less than `b` or the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`, and the last element of `array2` is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated by appending the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still increased by 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `feat` are still the same as in the initial state.
