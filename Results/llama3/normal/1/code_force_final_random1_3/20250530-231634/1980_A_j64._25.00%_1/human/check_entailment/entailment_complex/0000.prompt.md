Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m, and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5.

    return results
    #The program returns a list containing the missing values for all test cases. Each missing value is the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in a, capped at 0, where a is an empty string, and m is the second element of the last tuple in test_cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It takes in a positive integer 't' representing the number of test cases and a list of test cases, where each test case contains the number of problems in the bank, the number of upcoming rounds, and a string of problem difficulties. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, where each result is the sum of the differences between the number of upcoming rounds and the frequency of each problem difficulty, capped at 0. The function processes each test case independently and does not modify the input variables.
