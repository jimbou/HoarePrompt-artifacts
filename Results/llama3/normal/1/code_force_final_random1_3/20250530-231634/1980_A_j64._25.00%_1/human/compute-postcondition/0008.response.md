Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 3 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` has been incremented by 3, `prob` is the third character of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0. The value of `test_cases` remains a list of tuples. The value of `results` remains an empty list. The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 0. The value of `m` remains an integer. The value of `a` remains a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 3 characters. The value of `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` has been incremented by 3. The value of `prob` remains the third character of `a`.
