Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the missing value and the newly appended missing value, n is the first element of the tuple at index _ in test_cases, m is the second element of the tuple at index _ in test_cases, a is the third element of the tuple at index _ in test_cases, freq is a list of 7 zeros, prob is the last character of a**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `a` have been updated to the corresponding elements of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`. The `freq` list has been reset to a list of 7 zeros, and the `prob` variable now holds the last character of the string `a`. The other variables, `t`, `test_cases`, and `results`, remain unchanged.
