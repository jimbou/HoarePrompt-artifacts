Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the missing value, n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a string, freq is a list of 7 zeros, prob is the last character of a which is a string
Code of the loop:
for prob in a:
    freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index of the first character of `a` is increased by 1, `prob` is the first character of `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index of the second character of `a` is increased by 2, `prob` is the second character of `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index of the third character of `a` is increased by 3, `prob` is the third character of `a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
