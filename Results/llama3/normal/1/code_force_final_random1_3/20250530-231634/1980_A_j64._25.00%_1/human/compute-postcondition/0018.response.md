Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index of the third character of `a` is increased by 3, `prob` is the third character of `a`**

In this output state, the value of `freq` has been updated. The index of the third character of `a` in `freq` has been increased by 1 (from 2 to 3) because the third character of `a` is `prob` and `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1` increments the value at that index by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
