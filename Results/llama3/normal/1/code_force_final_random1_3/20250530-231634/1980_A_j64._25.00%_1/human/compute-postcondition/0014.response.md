Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index of the first character of `a` is increased by 1, `prob` is the first character of `a`**

In this output state, the value of `freq` has been updated. The index of the first character of `a` in `freq` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
