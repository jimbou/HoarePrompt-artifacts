Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m, and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, results is an empty list.**

The code defines a function to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create, but it does not execute this function. It only initializes an empty list called `results`. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The only change is the addition of a new variable `results`, which is an empty list.
