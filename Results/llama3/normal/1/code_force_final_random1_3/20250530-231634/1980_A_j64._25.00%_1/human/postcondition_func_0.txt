This function calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It takes in a positive integer 't' representing the number of test cases and a list of test cases, where each test case contains the number of problems in the bank, the number of upcoming rounds, and a string of problem difficulties. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, where each result is the sum of the differences between the number of upcoming rounds and the frequency of each problem difficulty, capped at 0. The function processes each test case independently and does not modify the input variables.
