Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the missing value and the newly appended missing value, n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a string, freq is a list of 7 integers where the index of each character of a is increased by the number of times it appears in a, prob is the last character of a.**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that the results list now contains the missing value and the newly appended missing value, which is the sum of the differences between the integer m and each frequency count in the freq list, where the difference is capped at 0 if it would be negative. The other variables remain unchanged.
