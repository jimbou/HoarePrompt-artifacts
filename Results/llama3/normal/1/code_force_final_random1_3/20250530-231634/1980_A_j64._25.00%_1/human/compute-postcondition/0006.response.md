Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 2 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` has been incremented by 2, `prob` is the second character of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the frequency of the second character of string `a` has been incremented by 1 in the `freq` list.
