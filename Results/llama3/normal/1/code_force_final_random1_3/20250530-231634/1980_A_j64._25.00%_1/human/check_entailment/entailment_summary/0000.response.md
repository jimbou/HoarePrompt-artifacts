Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. The program initializes a frequency array to keep track of the number of problems of each difficulty level. It then iterates over the string of problem difficulties and updates the frequency array accordingly. After that, it calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by taking the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of upcoming rounds and the frequency of each problem difficulty. Finally, it sums up the missing problems for all difficulty levels and appends the result to the list of results.

The program handles the input correctly, processing each test case independently and not modifying the input variables. The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example input and output match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
