To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a` and `prob`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `a` has at least 3 characters. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 characters, and `prob` is the second character of `a`. To execute the loop again, `a` must have at least 3 characters, and `prob` must be the third character of `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index of the third character of `a` is increased by 2, `prob` is the third character of `a`**
