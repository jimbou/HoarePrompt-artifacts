Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m, and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, a = test_cases[_]
    freq = [0] * 7
    for prob in a:
        freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
    missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)
    results.append(missing)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the missing value, n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is an empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in a has been incremented by the number of times that character appears in a, prob is the last character of a which is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the missing value and the newly appended missing value, n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a string, freq is a list of 7 integers where the index of each character of a is increased by the number of times it appears in a, prob is the last character of a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the missing value and the newly appended missing value, n is the first element of the tuple at index _ in test_cases, m is the second element of the tuple at index _ in test_cases, a is an empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index ord(prob) - ord('A') is equal to the number of occurrences of prob in a and the rest are 0, prob is the last character of a, missing is the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in a, capped at 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
