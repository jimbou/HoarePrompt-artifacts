Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value and the newly appended missing value, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index _ in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index _ in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 2 and the rest are 0, `prob` is the next character in `a`**

In this output state, the value of `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `freq` still has 7 integers, but the integer at the index corresponding to the character `prob` has been incremented. The rest of the integers in `freq` are still 0. The string `a` still has at least one more character, and `prob` is still the next character in `a`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `m` are unchanged.
