Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 1 character, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` has been incremented by 1, `prob` is the first character of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `freq` has been updated by incrementing the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The index of `freq` that has been incremented is determined by the ASCII value of `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A', which gives the position of `prob` in the alphabet.
