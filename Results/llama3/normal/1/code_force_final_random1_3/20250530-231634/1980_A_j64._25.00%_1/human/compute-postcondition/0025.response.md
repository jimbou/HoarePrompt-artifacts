Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value and the newly appended missing value, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index _ in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index _ in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 1 and the rest are 0, `prob` is the first character of `a`**

In this output state, the value of `freq` has been updated. The index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in the `freq` list has been incremented by 1, while the rest of the indices remain 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
