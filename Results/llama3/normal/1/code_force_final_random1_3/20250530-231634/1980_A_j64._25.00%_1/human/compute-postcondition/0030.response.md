Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value and the newly appended missing value, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index _ in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index _ in `test_cases`, `a` is an empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is equal to the number of occurrences of `prob` in `a` and the rest are 0, `prob` is the last character of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the string `a` is fully processed, and the frequency of each character in `a` is stored in the `freq` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
