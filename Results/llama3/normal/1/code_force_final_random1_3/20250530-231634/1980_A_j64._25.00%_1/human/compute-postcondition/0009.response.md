Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is an empty list, n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is an empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in a has been incremented by the number of times that character appears in a, prob is the last character of a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the variables is as follows: t remains a positive integer greater than 0, test_cases remains a list of tuples, results remains an empty list, n remains an integer greater than 0, m remains an integer, a becomes an empty string because all its characters have been processed, freq becomes a list of 7 integers where each index corresponds to the ASCII value of each character in a and has been incremented by the number of times that character appears in a, and prob becomes the last character of a.
