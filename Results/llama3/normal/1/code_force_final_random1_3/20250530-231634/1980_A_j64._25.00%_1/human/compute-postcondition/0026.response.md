To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for prob in a:`.

The only object in the loop head is `prob`, which is an element of the string `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty string, we can adjust the state of `prob` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `prob` is the first character of `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more character. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `a` to be a non-empty string with at least one more character.

The state of `prob` can be adjusted to be the next character in the string `a`.

The other variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `m`, and `freq` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the missing value and the newly appended missing value, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index _ in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index _ in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 1 and the rest are 0, `prob` is the next character in `a`**
