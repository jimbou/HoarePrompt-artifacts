Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the missing value and the newly appended missing value, n is the first element of the tuple at index _ in test_cases, m is the second element of the tuple at index _ in test_cases, a is an empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index ord(prob) - ord('A') is equal to the number of occurrences of prob in a and the rest are 0, prob is the last character of a, missing is the sum of the differences between m and the frequency of each character in a, capped at 0.**

In this output state, the value of `missing` has been calculated as the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in `a`, capped at 0. This means that `missing` now holds the total number of missing characters in `a` with respect to the frequency of each character. The `results` list has been updated to include this newly calculated `missing` value. All other variables remain unchanged.
