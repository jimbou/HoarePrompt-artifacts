To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(lk - 1):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `lk`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `lk`. If `i` is less than `lk - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `lk` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `lk` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and 2, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and `lk` is at least 3, `i` is 2**
