Functionality: **This function generates a list of numbers based on the binary representation of a given integer `n` and an integer `k`, and returns a string containing the length of the list and its elements. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns a specific string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of powers of 2 up to the number of digits in the binary representation of `n`, with some modifications based on the value of `k`. The returned string is in the format "length_of_ans\n element1 element2 ... element_ans".**
