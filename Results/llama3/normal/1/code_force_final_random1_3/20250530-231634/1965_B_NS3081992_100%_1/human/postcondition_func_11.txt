This function calculates and returns the rank of a given key in a dictionary. It takes a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list of integers `processing`, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list of integers `rank`. The function iterates through the list of integers associated with the key `da` in the dictionary, checks if each integer is not being processed, and recursively calls another function `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the rank of the key `da` in the `rank` list and returns the calculated rank. If the list of integers associated with the key `da` has only one element, the function returns 1.
