Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and at least 5 and at most 6, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and at least 2 and less than or equal to `l`, `i` is `lk+2`, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk), 2^(lk+1), 2^(lk+1), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, 2^(lk+2).**

The code appends the value of 2 raised to the power of `i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is equal to `lk+2`, the value appended to `ans` is 2^(lk+2). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
