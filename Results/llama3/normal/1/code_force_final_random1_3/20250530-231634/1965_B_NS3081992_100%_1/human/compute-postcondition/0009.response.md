The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `lk`. If `i` is less than `lk - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `lk` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `lk` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and `lk` is at least 3, `i` is 1**
