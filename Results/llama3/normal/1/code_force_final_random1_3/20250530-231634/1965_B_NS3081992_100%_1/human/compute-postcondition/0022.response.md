Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. If k equals 1 and n is not equal to 2, the program maintains the values of n, k, b, and l. Otherwise, k is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, and the program updates the values of b, l, and introduces new variables bk, lk, i, ans, and updates the values of k. The updated values are such that lk is at least 2 and less than or equal to l, ans is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1), and k is updated to k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1.***
