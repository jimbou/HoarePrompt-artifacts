Output State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 1, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains a string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character repeated at least three times**

The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. Since the standard output already contains a string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character repeated at least twice, the total number of newline characters at the end of the standard output is now at least three. The values returned by `func_10()` and `func_14()` are not affected by this code.
