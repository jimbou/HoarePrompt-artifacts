The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the function `func_10()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `func_10()`. If the value returned by `func_10()` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` returns a value greater than 1. So for the loop to execute again, the value returned by `func_10()` must be greater than 2.
State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 2, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains a string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character repeated at least three times**
