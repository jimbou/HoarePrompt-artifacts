Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    func_15()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it, ensuring the returned value is greater than 0.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  Reads a line from standard input, splits it into two space-separated integers, and returns them as a map object, ensuring the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into two space-separated integers, and returns them as a list, ensuring the first integer is positive and the second integer is positive and less than or equal to the first integer.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  Generates a list of 'rows_number' elements, each being the result of a separate call to 'func_3()'.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a line of input from the standard input, removes trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line of input from standard input (stdin) and returns the input string, stripped of trailing newlines and decoded from bytes to a Unicode string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a single line of input from stdin, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list of integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  This function generates a list by repeating the result of an external function, func_7(), a specified number of times, equal to the input parameter 'rows', and returns this list. The function assumes 'rows' is a positive integer and does not validate this assumption. The nature and content of the list are determined by the external function func_7(), which is not defined within this function.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  Reads a string from the standard input (stdin) and returns it.
Function number 10 :

''' 

 Output hints for function10:  Reads an integer from standard input and returns it as the number of test cases.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''

 Output hints for function11:  Reads a line of space-separated values from standard input and returns them as a list of strings, where each string is a value from the input line.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):

            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the rank of a given key in a dictionary. It takes a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list of integers `processing`, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list of integers `rank`. The function iterates through the list of integers associated with the key `da` in the dictionary, checks if each integer is not being processed, and recursively calls another function `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the rank of the key `da` in the `rank` list and returns the calculated rank. If the list of integers associated with the key `da` has only one element, the function returns 1.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1

    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, where b < a, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, it returns 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls func_13 with b and a % b to compute the GCD and coefficients.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:

            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function generates a list of numbers based on the binary representation of a given integer `n` and an integer `k`, and returns a string containing the length of the list and its elements. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns a specific string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of powers of 2 up to the number of digits in the binary representation of `n`, with some modifications based on the value of `k`. The returned string is in the format "length_of_ans\n element1 element2 ... element_ans".
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output a number of times equal to the non-negative integer returned by `func_10()`.
