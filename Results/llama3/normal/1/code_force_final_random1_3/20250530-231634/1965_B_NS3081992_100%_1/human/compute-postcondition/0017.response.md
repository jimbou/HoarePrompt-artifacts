The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `lk`, `l` is at least `lk+1` and at most 6. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is `lk+1`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and at least `lk+2` and at most 6, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and at least 2 and less than or equal to `l`, `i` is `lk+1`, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk), 2^(lk+1), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`.**
