Output State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 0, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains a string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values returned by `func_10()` and `func_14()` remain unchanged. The code only writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character. The standard output now contains this string, but the values of `func_10()` and `func_14()` are still the same as before.
