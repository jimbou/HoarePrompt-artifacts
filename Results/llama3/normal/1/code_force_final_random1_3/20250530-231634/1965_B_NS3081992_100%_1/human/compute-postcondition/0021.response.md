Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and at least `lk` and at most 6, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and at least 2 and less than or equal to `l`, `i` is `l`, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^6, `k` remains an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` remains a string of binary digits representing `n`, `l` remains the number of digits in `b` and is at least `lk` and at most 6, `bk` remains a string of binary digits representing `k`, `lk` remains the number of digits in `bk` and is at least 2 and less than or equal to `l`, `i` is now equal to `l`, and `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`.
