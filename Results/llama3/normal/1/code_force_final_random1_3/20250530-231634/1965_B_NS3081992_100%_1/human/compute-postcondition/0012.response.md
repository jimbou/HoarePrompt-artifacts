Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2 and 2^2, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and `lk` is at least 3, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending 2^2 to the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
