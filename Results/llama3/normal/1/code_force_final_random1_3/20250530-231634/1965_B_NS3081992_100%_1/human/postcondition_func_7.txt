This function generates a list by repeating the result of an external function, func_7(), a specified number of times, equal to the input parameter 'rows', and returns this list. The function assumes 'rows' is a positive integer and does not validate this assumption. The nature and content of the list are determined by the external function func_7(), which is not defined within this function.
