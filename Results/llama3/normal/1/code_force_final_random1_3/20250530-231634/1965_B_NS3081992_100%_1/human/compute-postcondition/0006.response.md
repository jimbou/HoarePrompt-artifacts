Output State: **The loop executes `func_10()` times, where `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer. `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, and the standard output contains a string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character repeated `func_10()` times.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will execute a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`, which is a non-negative integer. In each iteration, `func_14()` will return a value that can be converted to a string, and this string will be written to the standard output followed by a newline character. The total number of times this string is written to the output will be equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.
