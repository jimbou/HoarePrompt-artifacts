Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and at least `lk+1` and at most 6, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and at least 2 and less than or equal to `l`, `i` is at least `lk`, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^i, `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending `2 ** i` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still at least `lk`, and the list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is `2` raised to the power of `i`.
