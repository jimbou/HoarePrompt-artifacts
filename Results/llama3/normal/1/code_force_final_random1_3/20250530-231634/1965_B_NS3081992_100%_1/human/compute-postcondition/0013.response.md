Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and `lk` is at least 2, `i` is lk-2**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the list `ans` will contain powers of 2 from 1 to 2^(lk-2), where `lk` is the number of digits in the binary representation of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
