To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution) and the function `func_10()`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 0, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string**
