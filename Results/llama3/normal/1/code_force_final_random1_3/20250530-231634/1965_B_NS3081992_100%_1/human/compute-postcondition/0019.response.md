To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `lk`, and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `lk+1`, `lk` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `l`, and `l` is at least `lk+2` and at most 6.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `lk+2`. Since `lk` is at least 2, `lk+2` is at most 4 and less than or equal to `l`. Therefore, `l` must be at least 5.

The other variables, `n`, `k`, `b`, `bk`, `ans`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 < k <= n, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `b` and at least 5 and at most 6, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in `bk` and at least 2 and less than or equal to `l`, `i` is `lk+2`, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk), 2^(lk+1), 2^(lk+1), `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`.**
