Output State: **`func_10()` returns a value greater than 2, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output contains a string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character repeated at least four times**

In this output state, the values returned by `func_10()` and `func_14()` remain unchanged. However, the standard output has been updated to include an additional string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character, resulting in a total of at least four newline characters.
