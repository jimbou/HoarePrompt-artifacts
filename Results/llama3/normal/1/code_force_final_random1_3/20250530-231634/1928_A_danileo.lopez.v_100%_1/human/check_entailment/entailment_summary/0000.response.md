Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if either of the dimensions (a or b) is even, and if so, it checks if the other dimension is equal to half of the even dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly handles the cases where the dimensions are odd, in which case it immediately prints 'No'. It also correctly handles the cases where the dimensions are even, but the other dimension is not equal to half of the even dimension, in which case it prints 'Yes'.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the program produces the correct output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
