Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `b1` is the integer division of `b` by 2, `b2` is the integer division of `b` by 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), and the values of `a` and `b` remain between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `_` is still 2. The values of `b1` and `b2` are still the integer division of `b` by 2. The stdin now contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for the current iteration.
