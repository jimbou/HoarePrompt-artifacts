The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
