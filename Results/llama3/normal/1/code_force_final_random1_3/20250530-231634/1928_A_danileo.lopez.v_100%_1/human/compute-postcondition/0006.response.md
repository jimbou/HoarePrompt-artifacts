Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least one of `a` and `b` is even, `_` is 0, `a1` is equal to `a // 2`, `a2` is equal to `a // 2`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of `a1` is not equal to `b`.***
