Based on the precondition, the code will print 'No' only when the following conditions are met:

* `a` is odd or `b` is odd
* `a` is even and `b1` is equal to `a` (in this case, the program continues to the next line of code without printing 'Yes')

Since the precondition does not guarantee that these conditions will be met for all `t-1` lines of input, the code may not print 'No' for every iteration of the loop.

However, if the conditions are met, the code will print 'No' for each iteration of the loop where the conditions are satisfied.

Output: **'No' (for each iteration of the loop where the conditions are met)**
