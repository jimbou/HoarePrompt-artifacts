Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `b1` is equal to `b // 2`, `b2` is equal to `b // 2`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even and `b1` is equal to `a`, then the program continues to the next line of code. If `a` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, then 'Yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. If `a` is odd, then the program continues to the next line of code.**
