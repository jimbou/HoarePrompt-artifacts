Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least one of `a` and `b` is even, `_` is 0, `a1` is equal to `a // 2`, `a2` is equal to `a // 2`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is still an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and at least one of `a` and `b` is even. The new variables `a1` and `a2` are introduced, both of which are equal to `a // 2`, which is the integer division of `a` by 2. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
