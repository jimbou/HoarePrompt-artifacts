The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. The values of the variables are not affected, so the output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `b1` is the integer division of `b` by 2, `b2` is the integer division of `b` by 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and 'Yes' is being printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only.
