Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then forming another rectangle from these two rectangles.

The program works by checking if either the length or width of the rectangle is even. If either is even, it checks if the resulting rectangles after cutting can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. If both are odd, it immediately prints 'No' because it's impossible to form a different rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
