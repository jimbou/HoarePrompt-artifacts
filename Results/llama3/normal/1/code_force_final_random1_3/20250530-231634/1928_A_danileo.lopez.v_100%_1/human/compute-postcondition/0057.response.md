Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `b1` is the integer division of `b` by 2, `b2` is the integer division of `b` by 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even and `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, or if `a` is odd and `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, then 'Yes' is printed and the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for the current iteration. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
