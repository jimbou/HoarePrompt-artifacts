Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program outputs 'No', but it should output 'Yes' because the 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and then these two rectangles can be used to form the 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the 3x3 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the sides of the rectangle are even or odd, but it does not consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle. The program should check all possible ways to cut the rectangle and see if any of them can form a different rectangle.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('No')
        elif a % b == 0 or b % a == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This solution first checks if the sides of the rectangle are equal. If they are, it outputs 'No' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two different rectangles. Then it checks if one side is a multiple of the other. If it is, it outputs 'Yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two different rectangles. If neither of these conditions is true, it checks if both sides are even. If they are, it outputs 'Yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two different rectangles. Otherwise, it outputs 'No'.
