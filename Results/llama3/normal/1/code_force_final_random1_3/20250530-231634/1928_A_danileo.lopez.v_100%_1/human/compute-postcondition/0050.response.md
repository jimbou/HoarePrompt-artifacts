Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a1` is an integer between 0.5 and 5*10^8 (inclusive), `a2` is an integer between 0.5 and 5*10^8 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). We skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `a1`, `a2`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains `t-4` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration, so the program moves on to the next iteration of the loop.
