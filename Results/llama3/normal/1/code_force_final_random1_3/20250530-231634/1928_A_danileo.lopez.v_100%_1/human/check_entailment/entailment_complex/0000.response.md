Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. 

The program first checks if either of the dimensions (a or b) is even. If either dimension is even, it checks if the other dimension is equal to half of the even dimension. If this condition is met, it means that the rectangle can be cut into two identical rectangles, and therefore, another rectangle cannot be formed. In this case, the program prints 'No'. 

If the condition is not met, it means that the rectangle can be cut into two different rectangles, and therefore, another rectangle can be formed. In this case, the program prints 'Yes'. 

If neither dimension is even, it means that the rectangle cannot be cut into two identical rectangles, and therefore, another rectangle cannot be formed. In this case, the program also prints 'No'. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
