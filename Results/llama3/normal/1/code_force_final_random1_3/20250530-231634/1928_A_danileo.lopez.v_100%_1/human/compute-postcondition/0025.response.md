Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even and `b` is even, then `b1` is equal to `b // 2` and `b2` is equal to `b // 2`. If `a` is even and `b1` is equal to `a`, then the program continues to the next line of code. If `a` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, then 'Yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. If `a` is odd, then the program continues to the next line of code. If `b` is odd, then the program continues to the next line of code, and 'No' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'No' is printed.***
