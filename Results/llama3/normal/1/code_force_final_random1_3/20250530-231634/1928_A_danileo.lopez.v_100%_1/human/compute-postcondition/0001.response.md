The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `_` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `_` is 0 (the first value in the range).
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `_` is 0**
