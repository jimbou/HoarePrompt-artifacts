Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `a1` is the integer division of `a` by 2, `a2` is the integer division of `a` by 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a1` is not equal to `b`, 'Yes' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to the next line.***
