Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `b1` is equal to `b // 2`, `b2` is equal to `b // 2`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, then `a1` is equal to `a // 2` and `a2` is equal to `a // 2`. If `a1` is equal to `b`, then the program continues to the next line of code. Otherwise, the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. If `a` is odd, then the program continues to the next line of code. The current value of `b` is even**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `a`, and `_` remain the same. The values of `b1` and `b2` are now equal to half of the current value of `b`. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each with two integers a and b. The conditions for `a` being even or odd and the relationship between `a1`, `a2`, and `b` are still valid. The current value of `b` is even.
