Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
            if a1 != b:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        if b % 2 == 0:
            b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
            if b1 != a:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        print('No')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even and `b` is even, then `b1` is equal to `b // 2` and `b2` is equal to `b // 2`. If `a` is even and `b1` is equal to `a`, then the program continues to the next line of code. If `a` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, then 'Yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. If `a` is odd, then the program continues to the next line of code. If `b` is odd, then the program continues to the next line of code, and 'No' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` or `b` is even, then if `b` is even and the integer division of `b` by 2 is not equal to `a`, 'Yes' is printed and the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for the current iteration. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` or `b` is even, then if `b` is even and the integer division of `b` by 2 is not equal to `a`, 'Yes' is printed and the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for the current iteration. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
