Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) assigned from the first line of stdin, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the first line of stdin, which contains two integers separated by a space. The remaining lines in stdin, which are `t-3` in number, still contain two integers each. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
