Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `a1` is the integer division of `a` by 2, `a2` is the integer division of `a` by 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and 'Yes' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `a1`, and `a2` remain the same as before. The stdin now contains one less line of input, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the current iteration. The 'Yes' that was being printed is still being printed.
