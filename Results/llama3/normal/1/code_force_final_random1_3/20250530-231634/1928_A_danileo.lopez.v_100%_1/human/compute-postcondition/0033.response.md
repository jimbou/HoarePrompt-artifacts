Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, the program checks if the integer division of `a` by 2 is not equal to `b`, if so, it prints 'Yes' and skips to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise it continues to the next line.**
