Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `b1` is the integer division of `b` by 2, `b2` is the integer division of `b` by 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, then if `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, 'Yes' is printed and the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for the current iteration. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. If `a` is odd, then if `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, 'Yes' is printed and the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for the current iteration. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. Two new variables `b1` and `b2` are introduced, both of which are assigned the integer division of `b` by 2. The stdin still contains `t-3` lines, each with two integers `a` and `b`. The conditions for printing 'Yes' or 'No' are updated to use the new variable `b1` instead of the integer division of `b` by 2.
