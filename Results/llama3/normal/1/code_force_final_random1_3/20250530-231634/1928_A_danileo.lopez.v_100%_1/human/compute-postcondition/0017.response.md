Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `b1` is equal to `b // 2`, `b2` is equal to `b // 2`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of `b` is even. If `a` is even, then `a1` is equal to `a // 2` and `a2` is equal to `a // 2`. If `a` is odd, then the program continues to the next line of code. The current value of `b1` is not equal to `a`. and 'Yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `b1`, and `b2` remains the same. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines of input. The program skips the rest of the code in the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. The current value of `b` is even, and if `a` is even, then `a1` and `a2` are equal to `a // 2`. The current value of `b1` is not equal to `a`. Also, 'Yes' is printed.
