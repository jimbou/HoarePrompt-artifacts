Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `a1` is the integer division of `a` by 2, `a2` is the integer division of `a` by 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. The new variables `a1` and `a2` are introduced, each assigned the integer division of `a` by 2. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each with two integers a and b within the specified range.
