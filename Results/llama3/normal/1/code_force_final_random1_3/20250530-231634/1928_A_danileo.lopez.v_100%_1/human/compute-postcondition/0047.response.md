Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a1` is an integer between 0.5 and 5*10^8 (inclusive), `a2` is an integer between 0.5 and 5*10^8 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` or `b` is even, then if `b` is even and the integer division of `b` by 2 is not equal to `a`, 'Yes' is printed and the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped for the current iteration. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `a` is divided by 2 and assigned to both `a1` and `a2`. The values of `t`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b. The conditions for printing 'Yes' or 'No' are still valid.
