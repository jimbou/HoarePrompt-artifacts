Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `b1` is the integer division of `b` by 2, `b2` is the integer division of `b` by 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. The new variables `b1` and `b2` are introduced, both of which are assigned the integer division of `b` by 2. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b, as the code does not modify the input.
