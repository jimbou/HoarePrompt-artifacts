Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and at least one of `a` and `b` is even, `_` is 0, `a1` is equal to `a // 2`, `a2` is equal to `a // 2`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of `a1` is not equal to `b`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `a1`, and `a2` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains t-2 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b. The current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the program moves to the next iteration.
