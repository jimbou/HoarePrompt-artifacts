Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is one of the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` is the result of subtracting the product of `a // b` and `d` from `c`, where `c` is the other return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`.**

Note: Since we don't have the implementation of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the given information.
