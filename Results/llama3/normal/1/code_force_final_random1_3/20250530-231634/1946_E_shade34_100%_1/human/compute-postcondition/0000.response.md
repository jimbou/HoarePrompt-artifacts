Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a prime number, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `1000000007`, and assigns the return values to `c` and `d`. The exact values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe `c` and `d` as the return values of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.
