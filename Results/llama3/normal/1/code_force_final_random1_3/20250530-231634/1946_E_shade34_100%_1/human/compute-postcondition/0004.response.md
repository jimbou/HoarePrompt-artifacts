Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, `a` is less than `b`, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a`, and assigns the return values to `c` and `d`, respectively. The values of `c` and `d` are now determined by the output of `func_1`, but their exact values are unknown without knowing the implementation of `func_1`. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains the same, with `a` being less than `b`.
