#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is non-zero.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer, and the value 0 is also an integer and is equal to the current value of variable b.
    #State: *a and b are integers and b is non-zero
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`, which are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is the integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer, and a // b - 1 is also an integer. The negative of this integer is returned as the second value in the tuple.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is non-zero, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is one of the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` is the result of subtracting the product of `a // b` and `d` from `c`, where `c` is the other return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the result. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -(a // b - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns a tuple containing one of the return values of func_1 and the result of subtracting the product of a // b and the other return value of func_1 from the first return value of func_1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, a is non-negative and b is a prime number.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of a non-negative integer 'a' and 'c' (which is the return value of func_1(b, 1000000007)) modulo 1000000007, where 'b' is a prime number.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-negative integer 'a' and a prime number 'b' as inputs, multiplies 'a' by the result of calling function func_1 with 'b' and 1000000007, and returns the product modulo 1000000007.
