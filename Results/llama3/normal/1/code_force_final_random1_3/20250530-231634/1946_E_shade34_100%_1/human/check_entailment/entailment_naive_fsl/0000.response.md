Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to output the number of different permutations that could have been guessed, but the program does not provide a function to calculate this number. The provided functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, seem to be related to modular arithmetic, but they do not solve the problem described.

A correct solution would involve calculating the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions, which would require a more complex algorithm. The provided code does not attempt to solve this problem, and therefore, it is incorrect.

Note that the problem description provides examples of input and output, but the program does not provide a way to calculate the output for these examples. This further supports the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
