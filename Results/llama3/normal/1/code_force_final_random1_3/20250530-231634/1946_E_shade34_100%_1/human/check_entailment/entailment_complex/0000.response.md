Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations and combinatorics. It uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of suitable permutations that meet certain conditions.

`func_1` appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. This function is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number, which is necessary for the combinatorial calculations.

`func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number, and then multiplies this result with another number to obtain the final result.

The main program reads input data, including the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, as well as the indices of these maximums. It then uses these values to calculate the number of suitable permutations using the `func_2` function.

The program correctly handles the cases where the input data is invalid (e.g., when the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not match), and it correctly calculates the number of suitable permutations for the valid cases.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
