Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations and combinatorics. The program calculates the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program first initializes a list of factorials modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used later in the calculations. It then iterates over the test cases, reading the input data for each case.

For each test case, the program checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is equal to the length of the permutation. If any of these conditions are not met, the program prints 0, indicating that there are no suitable permutations.

If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of suitable permutations using a combination of combinatorial formulas and modular arithmetic. It uses the `func_2` function to calculate the combinations, which in turn uses the `func_1` function to calculate the modular inverses.

The program then prints the calculated number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the combinatorial formulas and modular arithmetic, and it handles the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
