Functionality: **This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the result. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -(a // b - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns a tuple containing one of the return values of func_1 and the result of subtracting the product of a // b and the other return value of func_1 from the first return value of func_1.**
