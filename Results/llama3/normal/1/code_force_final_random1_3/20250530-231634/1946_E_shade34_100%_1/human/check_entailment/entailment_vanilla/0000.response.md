Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Function 1, `func_1(a, b)`, is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `b`. This function uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients `c` and `d` such that `a*c + b*d = gcd(a, b)`. The modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `b` is then `c` modulo `b`.

Function 2, `func_2(a, b)`, is used to calculate the modular multiplication of `a` and the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`. This function uses the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`, and then multiplies `a` with this inverse modulo `1000000007`.

The main program is not provided, but based on the problem description, it should read the input, calculate the number of different permutations using the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and then output the result modulo `1000000007`.

Assuming the main program is correctly implemented, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
