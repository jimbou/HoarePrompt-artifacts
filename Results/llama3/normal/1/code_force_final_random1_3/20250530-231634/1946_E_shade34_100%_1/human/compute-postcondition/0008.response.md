Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is the integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer, and a // b - 1 is also an integer. The negative of this integer is returned as the second value in the tuple.**
