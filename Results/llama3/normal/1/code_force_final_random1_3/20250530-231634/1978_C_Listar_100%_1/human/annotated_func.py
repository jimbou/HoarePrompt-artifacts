#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer.

    #State: n is a positive integer, k is 0, l is a list of integers from 1 to n, c is n/2 + 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` as input, modifies a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n`, and returns the modified list. The function performs the following actions: it halves the value of `k`, iterates over the list in reverse order, and for each iteration, it increments a counter `c` and checks if `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, it returns the original list. If `k` is less than the current index minus 1, it calls another function `func_2` with `c`, `k`, and `l` as arguments and returns the result. Otherwise, it decrements `k` by the current index minus 1 and calls another function `func_3` with `c` and `l` as arguments, updating the list `l`. The function continues this process until `k` is 0, at which point it returns the modified list `l`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: c and k are non-negative integers, l is a list of integers such that c + k < len(l).
    x, y = l[-c], l[-c - k]
    l[-c], l[-c - k] = y, x
    return l
    #The program returns list 'l' of integers where the value at index -c is swapped with the value at index -c - k, and c and k are non-negative integers such that c + k is less than the length of the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function swaps the values at two specific positions in a given list of integers. It takes a list and two non-negative integers as input, where the sum of the integers is less than the length of the list. The function then exchanges the values at the positions specified by the input integers, counting from the end of the list. The modified list is returned as output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a positive integer and l is a list of length at least 2*c such that c <= len(l)/2.
    x, y = l[-c], l[c - 1]
    l[c - 1], l[-c] = x, y
    return l
    #The program returns list 'l' of length at least 2*c, where c is a positive integer, c <= len(l)/2, l[c - 1] is l[-c], and l[-c] is l[c - 1].

#Overall this is what the function does:Swaps the elements at the c-1 and -c indices in a list of length at least 2*c, where c is a positive integer and c <= len(l)/2, and returns the modified list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values: 0 and 0. Both values are integers and are equal to zero. The current value of k is odd, but this information is not relevant to the return statement as it only returns constant values. The values of n and the input from stdin are also not relevant to the return statement.
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of two integers, and `k` is even
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of two integers, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is an integer equal to `(n + k) / 2`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is `n` squared divided by 2.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros, both of which are integers.
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of two integers, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is an integer equal to `(n + k) / 2`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is `n` squared divided by 2. `max_k` is larger than or equal to `k`
    return n, k
    #The program returns two values: a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` that is even.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input and returns either two zeros or the original `n` and `k` values, depending on the conditions met. If `k` is odd, it immediately returns two zeros. If `k` is even, it calculates a maximum value `max_k` based on `n` and checks if `k` exceeds this value. If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original `n` and `k` values. The function effectively filters or validates the input values based on these conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: l is an empty list, 'YES' is being printed, and all the integers in the list are printed followed by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: YES followed by a space, and nothing else since the list is empty
    return
    #The program returns nothing because there is no return value specified in the code snippet.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function prints 'YES' followed by all the integers in the input list, separated by spaces, and then prints an empty line. It empties the input list and does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
    n, k = func_4()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current value of 'n' remains 0, and 'NO' is still being printed.
    #State: `n` and `k` are returned from the function `func_4()`, and `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program returns the return value of func_1(n, k), where n is not equal to 0 and is returned from func_4(), and k is also returned from func_4().

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of 'n' and 'k' returned from another function 'func_4()'. If 'n' is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without any value. If 'n' is not 0, it calls another function 'func_1()' with 'n' and 'k' as arguments, and then calls 'func_5()' with the result of 'func_1()'. The function returns the result of 'func_1()' if 'n' is not 0.
