Output State: **`n` and `k` are returned from the function `func_4()`**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_4()`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are no longer valid. The function `func_4()` is assumed to return two integer values, which are assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The constraints on the values of `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12) are no longer applicable, as the new values of `n` and `k` are determined by the function `func_4()`.
