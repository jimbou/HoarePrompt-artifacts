This function takes a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` as input, modifies a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n`, and returns the modified list. The function performs the following actions: it halves the value of `k`, iterates over the list in reverse order, and for each iteration, it increments a counter `c` and checks if `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, it returns the original list. If `k` is less than the current index minus 1, it calls another function `func_2` with `c`, `k`, and `l` as arguments and returns the result. Otherwise, it decrements `k` by the current index minus 1 and calls another function `func_3` with `c` and `l` as arguments, updating the list `l`. The function continues this process until `k` is 0, at which point it returns the modified list `l`.
