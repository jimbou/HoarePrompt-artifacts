Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is n = 5 and k = 12, the program outputs "Yes" and the permutation [5, 4, 3, 1, 2], but the Manhattan value of this permutation is 6, not 12. This is because the program does not correctly calculate the Manhattan value of the permutation.

The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly handle the case when k is greater than the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length n. In this case, the program should output "No", but instead it outputs a permutation with a Manhattan value less than k.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check to ensure that the calculated Manhattan value is equal to k before outputting the permutation. If the calculated Manhattan value is less than k, the program should output "No".
