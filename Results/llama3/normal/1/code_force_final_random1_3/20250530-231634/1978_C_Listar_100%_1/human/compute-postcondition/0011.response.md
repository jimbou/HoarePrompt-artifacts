Output State: **l is an empty list, 'YES' is being printed, and all the integers in the list are printed followed by a space.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the list `l` will be empty because all its elements have been iterated over and printed. The string 'YES' will still be being printed because the loop does not affect it. All the integers that were in the list `l` will have been printed, each followed by a space, as a result of the loop's execution.
