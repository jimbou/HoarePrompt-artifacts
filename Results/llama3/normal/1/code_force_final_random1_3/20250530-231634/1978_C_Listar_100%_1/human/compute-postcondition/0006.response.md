Output State: **n and k are returned from the function func_4(), n is not equal to 0, l is the return value of func_1(n, k)**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the return value of `func_1(n, k)` to `l`. Since `n` and `k` are returned from the function `func_4()` and `n` is not equal to 0, the values of `n` and `k` are used as arguments to `func_1()`. The return value of `func_1(n, k)` is assigned to `l`.

The second line calls the function `func_5(l)`, passing the value of `l` as an argument. However, the code snippet does not provide any information about the implementation of `func_5()`, so we cannot determine its effect on the program state.

Therefore, the final output state includes the initial values of `n` and `k`, the new value of `l` assigned by the first line, and the unchanged value of `n` (which is not equal to 0).
