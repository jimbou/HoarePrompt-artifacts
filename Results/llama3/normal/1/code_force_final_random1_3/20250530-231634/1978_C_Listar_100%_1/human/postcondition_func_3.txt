This function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input and returns either two zeros or the original `n` and `k` values, depending on the conditions met. If `k` is odd, it immediately returns two zeros. If `k` is even, it calculates a maximum value `max_k` based on `n` and checks if `k` exceeds this value. If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original `n` and `k` values. The function effectively filters or validates the input values based on these conditions.
