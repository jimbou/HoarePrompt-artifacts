Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    No
    Yes
    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function takes a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` as input, modifies a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n`, and returns the modified list. The function performs the following actions: it halves the value of `k`, iterates over the list in reverse order, and for each iteration, it increments a counter `c` and checks if `k` is 0. If `k` is 0, it returns the original list. If `k` is less than the current index minus 1, it calls another function `func_2` with `c`, `k`, and `l` as arguments and returns the result. Otherwise, it decrements `k` by the current index minus 1 and calls another function `func_3` with `c` and `l` as arguments, updating the list `l`. The function continues this process until `k` is 0, at which point it returns the modified list `l`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function swaps the values at two specific positions in a given list of integers. It takes a list and two non-negative integers as input, where the sum of the integers is less than the length of the list. The function then exchanges the values at the positions specified by the input integers, counting from the end of the list. The modified list is returned as output.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Swaps the elements at the c-1 and -c indices in a list of length at least 2*c, where c is a positive integer and c <= len(l)/2, and returns the modified list.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input and returns either two zeros or the original `n` and `k` values, depending on the conditions met. If `k` is odd, it immediately returns two zeros. If `k` is even, it calculates a maximum value `max_k` based on `n` and checks if `k` exceeds this value. If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original `n` and `k` values. The function effectively filters or validates the input values based on these conditions.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  This function prints 'YES' followed by all the integers in the input list, separated by spaces, and then prints an empty line. It empties the input list and does not return any value.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  This function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of 'n' and 'k' returned from another function 'func_4()'. If 'n' is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns without any value. If 'n' is not 0, it calls another function 'func_1()' with 'n' and 'k' as arguments, and then calls 'func_5()' with the result of 'func_1()'. The function returns the result of 'func_1()' if 'n' is not 0.
