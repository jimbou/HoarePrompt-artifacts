The code snippet modifies the values of `nums[start + 1]` and `start`. The first line decrements the value of `nums[start + 1]` by 1, and the second line increments the value of `start` by 1.

Output State: **arr contains at least one 0, nums has 0 as a key with a count greater than or equal to 0, start is 2, vis is a set containing 0 and 1, and nums.get(start, 0) is greater than or equal to -1**
