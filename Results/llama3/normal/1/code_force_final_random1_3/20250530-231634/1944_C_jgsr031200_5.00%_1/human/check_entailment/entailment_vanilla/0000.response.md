Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program uses a Counter object from the collections module to count the frequency of each element in the input array. It then iterates through the elements, starting from 0, and checks if the current element is present in the Counter. If it is, the program decrements the count of the current element and the next element (if present). If the next element is not present, the program prints the current element plus one and returns.

The program's logic is based on the idea that Alice wants to maximize the MEX of her array, while Bob wants to minimize it. By iterating through the elements and decrementing the counts of the current and next elements, the program effectively simulates the game and finds the optimal strategy for both players.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input array, since it iterates through the elements once. The space complexity is also O(n), since it uses a Counter object to store the frequency of each element.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient in solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
