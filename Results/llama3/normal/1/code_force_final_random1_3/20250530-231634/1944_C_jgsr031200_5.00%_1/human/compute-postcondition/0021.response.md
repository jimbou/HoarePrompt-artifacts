Output State: **nums.get(start, 0) is 0, vis is a set containing all elements from arr, and start is the maximum value in arr plus 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the count of the current start value in the nums dictionary is 0, the vis set contains all elements from the arr list, and the start value is the maximum value in arr plus 1. This means that the loop has iterated over all elements in arr, and the start value has been incremented to the maximum value in arr plus 1.
