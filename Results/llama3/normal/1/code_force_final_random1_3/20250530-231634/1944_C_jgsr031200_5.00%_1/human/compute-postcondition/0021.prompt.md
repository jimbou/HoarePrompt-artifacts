Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of non-negative integers, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 0, vis is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while nums.get(start, 0):
    vis.add(start)
    nums[start] -= 1
    if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
        nums[start + 1] -= 1
        start += 1
    else:
        print(start + 1)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: arr contains at least one 0, nums has 0 as a key with a count greater than or equal to 0, start is 1, vis is a set containing 0, and nums.get(start + 1, 0) is greater than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *arr contains at least one 0, nums has 0 as a key with a count greater than or equal to 0, and vis is a set containing 0 and 1. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is True, then start is 2 and nums.get(start, 0) is greater than or equal to -1. Otherwise, start is 1, nums.get(start, 0) is greater than or equal to 0, and the number 2 is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *arr contains at least one 0, nums has 0 as a key with a count greater than or equal to 0, and vis is a set containing 0, 1, and start. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is greater than 0, then start is updated to start + 1, and nums has start + 1 as a key with a count greater than or equal to -1. If start + 1 is 2, then nums.get(start + 1, 0) is greater than or equal to -1. If start + 1 is 1, then nums.get(start + 1, 0) is greater than or equal to -1. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is not greater than 0, then the value of start + 1 is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
