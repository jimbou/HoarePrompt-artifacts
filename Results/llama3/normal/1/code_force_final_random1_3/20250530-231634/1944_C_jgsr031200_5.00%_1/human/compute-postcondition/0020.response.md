Postcondition: ***arr contains at least one 0, nums has 0 as a key with a count greater than or equal to 0, and vis is a set containing 0, 1, and start. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is greater than 0, then start is updated to start + 1, and nums has start + 1 as a key with a count greater than or equal to -1. If start + 1 is 2, then nums.get(start + 1, 0) is greater than or equal to -1. If start + 1 is 1, then nums.get(start + 1, 0) is greater than or equal to -1. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is not greater than 0, then the value of start + 1 is printed.***
