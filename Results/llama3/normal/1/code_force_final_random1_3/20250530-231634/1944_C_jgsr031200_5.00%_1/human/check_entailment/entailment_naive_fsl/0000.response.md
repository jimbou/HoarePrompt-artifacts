Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The function `func_1` correctly implements the game strategy for Alice and Bob, and the use of the `Counter` class from the `collections` module efficiently counts the occurrences of each number in the array.

The program iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and for each number, it checks if it is present in the array. If it is, it decrements the count of that number and moves to the next number. If the next number is also present, it decrements its count and moves to the next number. This process continues until it finds a number that is not present in the array, at which point it prints the current number plus one, which is the MEX of the array.

The program correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers, as well as the case where the array does not contain all numbers from 0 to `n-1`. It also correctly handles the case where the array is empty, in which case it prints 0.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.
