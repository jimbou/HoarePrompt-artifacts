This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints the maximum value in the list plus one. It also modifies the input list by decrementing the count of each number and its successor (if present) in the list, effectively "visiting" each number in the list. The function returns no value, but instead prints the maximum value in the list plus one.
