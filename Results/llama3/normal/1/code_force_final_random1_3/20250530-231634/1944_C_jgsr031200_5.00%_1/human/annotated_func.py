#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: nums.get(start, 0) is 0, vis is a set containing all elements from arr, and start is the maximum value in arr plus 1.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: the maximum value in arr plus 1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints the maximum value in the list plus one. It also modifies the input list by decrementing the count of each number and its successor (if present) in the list, effectively "visiting" each number in the list. The function returns no value, but instead prints the maximum value in the list plus one.
