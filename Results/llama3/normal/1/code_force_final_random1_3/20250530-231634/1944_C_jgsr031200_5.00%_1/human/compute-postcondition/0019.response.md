Output: **arr contains at least one 0, nums has 0 as a key with a count greater than or equal to 0, and vis is a set containing 0, 1, and start. If start is 2, then nums.get(start, 0) is greater than or equal to 0. If start is 1, then nums.get(start, 0) is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of start + 1 is being printed**
