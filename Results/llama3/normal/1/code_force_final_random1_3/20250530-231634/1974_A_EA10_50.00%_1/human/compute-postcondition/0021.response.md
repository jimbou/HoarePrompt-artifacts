Functionality: **This function reads a series of input pairs from the standard input, where the first input is the number of pairs to follow. For each pair of integers x and y, it calculates a value z based on the given formula and prints the result. The calculation of z depends on the intermediate value m; if m is less than the initial input a, z is adjusted accordingly. The function processes all input pairs and outputs the calculated z values.**
