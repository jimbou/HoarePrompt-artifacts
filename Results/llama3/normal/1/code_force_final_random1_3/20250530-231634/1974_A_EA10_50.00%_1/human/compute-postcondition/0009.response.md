Output State: **a is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2, m is an integer equal to 15 * z - y * 4**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `a` and `i`, so they remain unchanged. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `y`, respectively. The second line assigns the value of `(y + 1) // 2` to `z`, which is a new value based on the updated value of `y`. The third line assigns the value of `15 * z - y * 4` to `m`, which is a new value based on the updated values of `z` and `y`.

Note that the initial state of `z` and `m` is not relevant, as they are reassigned new values based on the updated values of `y`. The final state of `z` and `m` is determined solely by the updated values of `y` and the calculations performed in the code.
