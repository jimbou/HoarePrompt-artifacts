Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` pairs of integers: x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    z = (y + 1) // 2
    m = 15 * z - y * 4
    if m < a:
        z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
    print(z)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2, m is an integer equal to 15 * z - y * 4. If m is less than a, then z is updated to ((y + 1) // 2) + ((x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15), and m is updated to 15 * (((y + 1) // 2) + ((x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15)) - y * 4, and the current value of m is less than or equal to a. Otherwise, the values of z and m remain unchanged, and the value of z is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, if m < a, then z is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * (y + 1) // 2 - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15 and m is an integer equal to 15 * ((y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * (y + 1) // 2 - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15) - y * 4. Otherwise, the values of z and m remain unchanged. The value of z is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is an integer equal to the first input, `y` is an integer equal to the second input. If `m` is less than `a`, `z` is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2 + (x - 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) + y * 4 + 15 - 1) // 15. Otherwise, `z` is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2, and the value of `z` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
