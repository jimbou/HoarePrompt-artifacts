To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0. Since `a` is already an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), we can conclude that `a` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so we need to initialize it to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

The state of `stdin` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0**
