Output State: **a is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * (y + 1) // 2 - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15, m is an integer equal to 15 * ((y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * (y + 1) // 2 - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15) - y * 4**

The value of z is updated by adding the result of the expression `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` to its previous value. Since `m` is equal to `15 * z - y * 4`, we can substitute this expression into the update for `z`. This results in `z` being updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - (15 * (y + 1) // 2 - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15`. The value of `m` is also updated accordingly, as it depends on the new value of `z`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
