Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is an integer equal to the first input, `y` is an integer equal to the second input, `z` is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2 + (x - 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) + y * 4 + 15 - 1) // 15, `m` is an integer equal to 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains unchanged between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` remains 2, `x` remains equal to the first input, `y` remains equal to the second input, `m` remains equal to 15 times the integer division of `y` plus 1 by 2 minus `y` times 4, and `z` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the integer division of `x` minus `m` plus 15 minus 1 by 15.
