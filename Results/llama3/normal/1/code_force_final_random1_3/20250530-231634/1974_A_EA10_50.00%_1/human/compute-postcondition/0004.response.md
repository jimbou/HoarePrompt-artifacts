Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer equal to ((y + 1) // 2) + ((x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15), `m` is an integer equal to 15 * (((y + 1) // 2) + ((x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15)) - y * 4, and the current value of `m` is less than or equal to `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `a` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` remains 0, `x` and `y` are still integers, `z` is updated to be the sum of its original value ((y + 1) // 2) and the integer division of (x - m + 15 - 1) by 15, where m is the original value of 15 * z - y * 4. The value of `m` is also updated based on the new value of `z`. The condition that the current value of `m` is less than or equal to `a` still holds.
