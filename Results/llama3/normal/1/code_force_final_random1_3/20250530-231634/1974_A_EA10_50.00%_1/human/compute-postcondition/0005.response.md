Postcondition: ***a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2, m is an integer equal to 15 * z - y * 4. If m is less than a, then z is updated to ((y + 1) // 2) + ((x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15), and m is updated to 15 * (((y + 1) // 2) + ((x - (15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4) + 15 - 1) // 15)) - y * 4, and the current value of m is less than or equal to a. Otherwise, the values of z and m remain unchanged.***
