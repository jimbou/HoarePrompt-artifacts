The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2, `m` is an integer equal to 15 * z - y * 4**
