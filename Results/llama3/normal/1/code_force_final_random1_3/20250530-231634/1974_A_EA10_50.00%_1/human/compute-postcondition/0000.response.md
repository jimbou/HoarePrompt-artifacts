Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` pairs of integers: x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `a` is assigned the integer value from the first input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `a` pairs of integers, each pair consisting of x and y, where 0 <= x, y <= 99.
