Output: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `x` is an integer equal to the first input, `y` is an integer equal to the second input. If `m` is less than `a`, `z` is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2 + (x - 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) + y * 4 + 15 - 1) // 15. Otherwise, `z` is an integer equal to (y + 1) // 2, and the value of `z` is being printed.**
