Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is (0, 3), the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be 2. However, when the input is (0, 4), the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be 3.

The issue with the program is that it calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons and then adds the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that the 1x1 icons can be placed on the same screen as the 2x2 icons, as long as there is enough space.

A correct approach would be to calculate the total number of cells needed for all icons and then divide that by the total number of cells on a screen (15) to get the minimum number of screens needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells = x + 4 * y
        screens_needed = (total_cells + 14) // 15
        print(screens_needed)
```

This program calculates the total number of cells needed for all icons and then divides that by 15 to get the minimum number of screens needed. It also adds 14 to the total number of cells before dividing to ensure that the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number, since you can't have a fraction of a screen.
