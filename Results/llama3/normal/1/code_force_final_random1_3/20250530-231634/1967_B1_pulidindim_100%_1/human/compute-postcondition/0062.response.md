The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans`. 

`ans` is calculated as `n + sum(int(g / count) + 1 for count in range(2, m + 1))`. 

Here, `n` is an integer, `g` is `int(n / m) - countmins` where `countmins` is `m - 1`, and `count` takes values from `2` to `m` (inclusive) in the `range(2, m + 1)`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans` as an integer.

Output: **integer value of n + sum(int(g / count) + 1 for count in range(2, m + 1)) (where n and m are integers)**
