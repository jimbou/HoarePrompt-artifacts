Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, count is 3, ans is n + int(g / count) + 1, countmins is 1, g is int(n / 2) - countmins**

The code snippet modifies the values of `g`, `ans`, and `count`. The first line decrements `g` by the value of `countmins`, which is 1. The second line increments `ans` by the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1. The third line increments `count` by 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
