Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is 2, ans is n**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the values of two integers from the input to `n` and `m`, respectively. The second line assigns the value 2 to `count`. The third line assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. 

The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The values of `n` and `m` are determined by the input, and `count` is set to 2. The value of `ans` is equal to the value of `n`.
