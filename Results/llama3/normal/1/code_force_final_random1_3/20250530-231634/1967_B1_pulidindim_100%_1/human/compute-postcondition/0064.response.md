Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is t, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + sum(int(g / count) + 1 for count in range(2, m + 1)), countmins is m - 1, g is int(n / m) - countmins, and the integer value of ans is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` will be equal to `t`, `n` and `m` will still be integers, `count` will be `m + 1`, `ans` will be the sum of `n` and the summation of `(int(g / count) + 1)` for `count` in range `2` to `m`, `countmins` will be `m - 1`, `g` will be `int(n / m) - countmins`, and the integer value of `ans` will be printed.
