Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is 4, ans is n + int(g / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1, countmins is 2, g is int(n / count) - countmins.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` and `m` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, making it 4. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its previous value, where `g` is now `int(n / count) - countmins`. The value of `countmins` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `g` is updated by subtracting `countmins` from its previous value.
