Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

Since the initial state specifies that the first line of the input contains the number of test cases `t`, we can conclude that `t` will be assigned a value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The values of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6)**.

Note that the output state still includes the information about the remaining test cases in the input, as they have not been processed yet.
