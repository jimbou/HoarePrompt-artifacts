Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is less than or equal to 4, ans is n + int(g / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1, countmins is 1 less than count, g is int(n / count). If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
