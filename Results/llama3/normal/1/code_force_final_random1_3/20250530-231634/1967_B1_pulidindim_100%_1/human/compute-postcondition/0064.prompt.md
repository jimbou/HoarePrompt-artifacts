Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = int(count - 1)
        g = int(n / count)
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += int(g / count) + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + sum(int(n / count) - countmins + 1) for count in range(2, m + 1), countmins is m - 1, g is int(n / count) - countmins, and the integer value of ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is m+1, ans is n + sum(int(n / count) - countmins + 1) from count=2 to m, countmins is m, g is int(n / count) - countmins, and the integer part of ans which is the sum of n and the summation of (int(n / count) - countmins + 1) from count=2 to m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + sum(int(g / count) + 1 for count in range(2, m + 1)), countmins is m - 1, g is int(n / m) - countmins, and the integer value of ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
