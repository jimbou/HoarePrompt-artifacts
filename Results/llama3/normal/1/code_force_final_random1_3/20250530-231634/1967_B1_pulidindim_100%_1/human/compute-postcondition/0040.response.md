Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is m+1, ans is n + sum(int(n / count) - countmins + 1) from count=2 to m, countmins is m, g is int(n / count) - countmins.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
*   The variable `i` remains 1.
*   The variable `n` remains an integer.
*   The variable `m` remains an integer.
*   The variable `count` is now `m+1`, indicating that the loop has executed `m` times.
*   The variable `ans` is now `n` plus the sum of `int(n / count) - countmins + 1` from `count=2` to `m`. This represents the total number of times the loop has executed, with each iteration adding `int(n / count) - countmins + 1` to `ans`.
*   The variable `countmins` is now `m`, which is the final value of `count-1` after the loop has executed `m` times.
*   The variable `g` is now `int(n / count) - countmins`, which is the final value of `g` after the loop has executed `m` times.
