The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `count` is m+1, `ans` is n + sum(int(n / count) - countmins + 1) from count=2 to m, `countmins` is m, `g` is int(n / count) - countmins**
