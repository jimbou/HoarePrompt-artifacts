Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is m+1, ans is n + sum(int(n / count) - countmins + 1) from count=2 to m, countmins is m, g is int(n / count) - countmins, and the integer part of ans which is the sum of n and the summation of (int(n / count) - countmins + 1) from count=2 to m is being printed**
