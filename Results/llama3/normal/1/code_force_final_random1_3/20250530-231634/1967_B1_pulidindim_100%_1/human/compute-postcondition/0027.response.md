Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, and the current value of g is less than countmins, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, i, n, m, count, ans, countmins, and g remain unchanged.
