To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0**
