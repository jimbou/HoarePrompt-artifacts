Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is m, g is int(n / count) - countmins**

The code snippet first assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `m`. The second line assigns the value 2 to `count`. The third line assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. The fourth line does not affect any variables.

The initial state of `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), which remains unchanged. The initial state of `i` is 2, which also remains unchanged. The initial state of `n` and `m` are integers, which are updated with the input values. The initial state of `count` is `m+1`, which is updated to 2. The initial state of `ans` is `n + sum(int(n / count) - countmins + 1) from count=2 to m`, which is updated to just `n`. The initial state of `countmins` is `m`, which remains unchanged. The initial state of `g` is `int(n / count) - countmins`, which is updated with the new values of `n` and `count`.
