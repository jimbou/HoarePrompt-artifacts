Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, m must be greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is n/2**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `count - 1` to `countmins`. Since `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes 1. The second line assigns the value of `n / count` to `g`. Since `count` is 2, `g` becomes `n/2`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
