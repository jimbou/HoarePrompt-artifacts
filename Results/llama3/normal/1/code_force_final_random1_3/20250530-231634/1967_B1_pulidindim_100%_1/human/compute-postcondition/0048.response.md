Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)` and the current value of `g` is less than the current value of `countmins`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which does not affect the values of the variables.
