Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is less than `countmins`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
