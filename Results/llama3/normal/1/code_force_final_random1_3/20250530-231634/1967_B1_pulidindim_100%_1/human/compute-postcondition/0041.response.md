The code prints the integer value of `ans`, which is the result of the calculation `n + sum(int(n / count) - countmins + 1)` from `count=2` to `m`. 

Here, `n` is an integer, `count` is `m+1`, `countmins` is `m`, and `g` is `int(n / count) - countmins`. 

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **the integer value of ans (where ans is the result of the calculation n + sum(int(n / count) - countmins + 1) from count=2 to m)**
