The code snippet modifies the values of `countmins` and `g`. The first line assigns the integer value of `count - 1` to `countmins`. Since `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes 1. The second line assigns the integer value of `n / count` to `g`. Since `n` is an integer and `count` is 2, `g` becomes `int(n / 2)`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is int(n / 2)**
