Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is n + int(g / count) + 1, countmins is 2, g is int(n / count). If g is less than countmins, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
