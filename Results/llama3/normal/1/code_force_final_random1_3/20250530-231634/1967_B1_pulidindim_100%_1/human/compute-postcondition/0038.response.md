Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to `count+1`, `count` is less than or equal to `m` and is one more than its original value, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1`, `countmins` is equal to `count - 1`, `g` is equal to `int(n / count)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
