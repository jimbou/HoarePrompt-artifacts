Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, count is 3, ans is n + int(g / count) + 1, countmins is 2, g is int(n / count). If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
