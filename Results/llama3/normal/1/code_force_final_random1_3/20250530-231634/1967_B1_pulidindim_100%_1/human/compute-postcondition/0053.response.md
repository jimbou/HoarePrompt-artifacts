Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / count)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, as the `break` statement does not modify any variables. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
