Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 3, count is less than or equal to m, ans is n + int(g / count) + 1, countmins is equal to count - 1, g is equal to int(n / count). If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
