Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`. If the current value of `g` is less than the current value of `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g`.**
