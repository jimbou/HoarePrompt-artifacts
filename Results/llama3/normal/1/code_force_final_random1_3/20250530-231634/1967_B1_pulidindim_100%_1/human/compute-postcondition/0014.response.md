According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable count and m.  If count is less than or equal to m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, count is 4 and m is greater than or equal to 4. So for the loop to be executed one more time count must be less than or equal to m. So count must be less than or equal to 4 and m must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is less than or equal to 4, ans is n + int(g / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1, countmins is 2, g is int(n / count) - countmins**
