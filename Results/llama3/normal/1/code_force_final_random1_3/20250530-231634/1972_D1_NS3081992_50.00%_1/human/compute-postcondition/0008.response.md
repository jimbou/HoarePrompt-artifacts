Output State: **The program returns the original value of 'ans' plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 1 to the square root of n + i, minus 1.**

In this output state, 'ans' is a value that is equal to its original value plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 1 to the square root of n + i. The value of 'n' is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, and 'i' is greater than the square root of n + i. The program returns this value minus 1.
