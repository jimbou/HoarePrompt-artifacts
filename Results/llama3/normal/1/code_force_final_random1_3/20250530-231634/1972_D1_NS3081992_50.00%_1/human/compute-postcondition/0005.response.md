Output State: **`func_10()` returns at least 3, `_` is 2, `func_15()` returns a string, and the string returned by `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character, and the string returned by `func_15()` is also written to the standard output.**

The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the string returned by `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character. This means that the string returned by `func_15()` is now printed to the console and also written to the standard output. The values of the other variables and functions are not affected by this code.
