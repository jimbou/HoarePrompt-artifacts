Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly handle the case when a and b are not coprime.

In the problem description, it is stated that a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b). However, the program does not take into account the gcd(a,b) part. It simply calculates the number of pairs (a, b) such that a+b is a multiple of b, which is not the correct condition.

For example, consider the case when n = 10 and m = 8. The program will output 14, but the correct answer is 13. The pair (10, 2) is not a valid pair because 10+2 is not a multiple of 2 * gcd(10,2) = 2 * 2 = 4.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
