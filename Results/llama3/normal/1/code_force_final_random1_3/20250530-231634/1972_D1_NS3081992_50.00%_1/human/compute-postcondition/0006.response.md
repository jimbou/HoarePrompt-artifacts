Output State: **The loop executes `func_10()` times, and the string returned by `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character, and the string returned by `func_15()` is also written to the standard output.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will run for a number of iterations equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. In each iteration, the string returned by `func_15()` will be printed to the console followed by a newline character, and the same string will also be written to the standard output. The loop will continue until it has executed `func_10()` times.
