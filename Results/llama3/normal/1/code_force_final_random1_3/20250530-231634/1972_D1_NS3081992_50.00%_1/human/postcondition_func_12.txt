This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, a and b, and returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. If b is 0, the function returns a tuple containing 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns a tuple containing the second return value of func_13, the first return value of func_13 minus the integer division of a by b times the second return value of func_13, and the third return value of func_13.
