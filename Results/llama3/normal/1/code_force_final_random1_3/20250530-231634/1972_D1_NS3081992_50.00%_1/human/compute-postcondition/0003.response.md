Output State: **`func_10()` returns at least 2, `_` is 1, `func_15()` returns a string, and the string returned by `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character, and the string returned by `func_15()` is also written to the standard output.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()`, `_`, and `func_15()` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the string returned by `func_15()` is now written to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`, in addition to being printed to the console followed by a newline character.
