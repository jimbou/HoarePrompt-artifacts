Reasoning: 

The problem statement requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). 

Function 15 is the main function that calculates the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by (i * i) for all i from 1 to the square root of n + i, minus 1. This function is called in Function 16, which prints the result to the console a certain number of times.

However, Function 15 does not correctly solve the problem. It only calculates the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by (i * i) for all i from 1 to the square root of n + i, minus 1, but it does not consider the condition that a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
