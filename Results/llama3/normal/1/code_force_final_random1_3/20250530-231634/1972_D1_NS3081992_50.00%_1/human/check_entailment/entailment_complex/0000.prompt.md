Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank` as input. It returns an integer value based on the length of the list `d[da]`. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list `d[da]`, updating the `processing` list and calculating a minimum value `tmp`. It then updates the `rank` list with `tmp + 1` and returns `tmp + 1`. The function modifies the `processing` and `rank` lists in place.

#Function 13:

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, a and b, and returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. If b is 0, the function returns a tuple containing 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns a tuple containing the second return value of func_13, the first return value of func_13 minus the integer division of a by b times the second return value of func_13, and the third return value of func_13.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are non-negative integers such that n is the length of list a, and k is an integer.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` as input. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element less than `m`, it subtracts the difference from `k`. If `k` is non-negative after this process, the function returns 1, indicating that `k` can cover the difference between all elements in `a` and `m`. Otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that `k` cannot cover the difference. The function does not modify the input list `a`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and m is a positive integer
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1

    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the original value of 'ans' plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 1 to the square root of n + i, minus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the sum of the integer divisions of (n + i) by (i * i) for all i from 1 to the square root of n + i, minus 1, where n is a positive integer.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_10() returns a non-negative integer, and the function func_15() returns a string.
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The loop executes `func_10()` times, and the string returned by `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character, and the string returned by `func_15()` is also written to the standard output.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function prints a string to the console a certain number of times, where the string is determined by another function and the number of times is determined by yet another function. The function does not return any value, but instead performs an action of writing to the standard output.
