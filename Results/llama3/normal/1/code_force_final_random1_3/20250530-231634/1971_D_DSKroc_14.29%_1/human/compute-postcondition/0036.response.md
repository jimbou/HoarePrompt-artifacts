Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 2, `i` is 1, and if the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
