Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, if the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `i` is 1 and `count` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `i` remains unchanged and `count` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `i` is 1 and `count` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `i` remains unchanged and `count` is increased by 1. The other variables `t`, `q`, `stdin`, and `s` remain unchanged.
