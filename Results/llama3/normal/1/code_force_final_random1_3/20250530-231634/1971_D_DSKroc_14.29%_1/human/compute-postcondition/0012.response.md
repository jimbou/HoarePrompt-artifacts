Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `i` is 2. If the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.***
