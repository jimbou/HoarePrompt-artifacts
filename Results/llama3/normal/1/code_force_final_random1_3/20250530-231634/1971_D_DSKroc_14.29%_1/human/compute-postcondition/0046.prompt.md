Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
            count += 1
    print(count + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` where the first character is greater than the second character, and the value of `count + 1` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of times a character in `s` is greater than the next character, and the value of `count + 1` is being printed, which is the number of times a character in `s` is greater than the next character plus 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, q is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, i is len(s) - 1, and count is the number of times a character in s is greater than the next character, and the value of count + 1 is being printed, where count + 1 is the total number of times a character in s is greater than or equal to the next character




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
