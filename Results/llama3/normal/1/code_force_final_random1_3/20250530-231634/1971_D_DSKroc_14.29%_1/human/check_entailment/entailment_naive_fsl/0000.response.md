Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string and counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'. This is because each time a '1' is followed by a '0', it means that the string is not sorted and a cut is needed to rearrange the string.

The program then adds 1 to the count, because even if there are no '1's followed by '0's, the string still needs to be cut into at least one piece (the entire string itself).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When the string is already sorted (e.g. "00000000" or "11111111"), the count is 0 and the program outputs 1, which is correct.
* When the string has only one '1' or one '0' (e.g. "1" or "0"), the count is 0 and the program outputs 1, which is correct.
* When the string has multiple '1's and '0's (e.g. "11010" or "0001111"), the program correctly counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' and outputs the correct minimum number of pieces needed.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all possible cases correctly.
