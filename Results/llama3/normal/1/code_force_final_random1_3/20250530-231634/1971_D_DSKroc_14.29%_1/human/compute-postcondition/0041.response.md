Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, `i` is 3. If the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `count` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is either 2 or 3, because it was either 1 or 2 before the increment. Otherwise, `count` is 1, because it was 0 before the increment. The values of the other variables remain the same.
