Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through the string and counting the number of times a character is greater than the next character. This count represents the number of "cuts" needed to separate the string into sorted pieces. The program then prints this count plus one, which represents the total number of pieces needed.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the string is already sorted (in which case the count is 0 and the program prints 1) and when the string has only one character (in which case the count is 0 and the program prints 1).

The program also correctly handles the input and output, reading the number of test cases and the strings from standard input, and printing the results to standard output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
