Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, if the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `i` is 0 and `count` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `i` and `count` remains unchanged.***
