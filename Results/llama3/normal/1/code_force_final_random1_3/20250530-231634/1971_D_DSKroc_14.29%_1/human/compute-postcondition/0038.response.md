Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `i` is 2, and `count` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` was either 0 or 1, depending on the comparison between `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]`. Now, `count` is either 1 or 2, depending on the same comparison. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
