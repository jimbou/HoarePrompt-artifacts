Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is greater than the character at index `i+1`, then `count` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `count` remains either 2 or 3.***
