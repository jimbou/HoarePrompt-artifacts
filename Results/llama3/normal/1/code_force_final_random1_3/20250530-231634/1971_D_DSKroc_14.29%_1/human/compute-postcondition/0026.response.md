Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `i` is 2, `count` is either 3 or 4**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
