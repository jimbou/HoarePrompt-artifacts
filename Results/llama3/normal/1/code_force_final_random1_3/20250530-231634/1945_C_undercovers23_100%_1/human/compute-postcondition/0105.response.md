Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least 1 element, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `ele` is the last element in the list, and `final` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list. The current value of `pk` is such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**
