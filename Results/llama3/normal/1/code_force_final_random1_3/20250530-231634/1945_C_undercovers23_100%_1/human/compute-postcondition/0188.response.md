Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is equal to `z`, `one` is equal to `o`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i` where `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `i` is -1, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `z * 100 // n`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`, stdin is empty, `elem` is the last element in the list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` also contains 0. Otherwise, `final` also contains `n` and `c1` is less than 50, and the first element of the final list is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

- The loop has finished executing all test cases (`t` is 0).
- The loop counter `_` is equal to the initial number of test cases `t`.
- The input variables `n` and `s` are still valid, with `n` being an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1.
- The counts of '1' and '0' in `s` are still stored in `o` and `z`, respectively.
- The variables `zero` and `one` have reached their final values, which are equal to `z` and `o`, respectively.
- The list `lst` contains all indices `i` where the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50.
- The variable `mini` stores the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and all elements in `lst`.
- The list `sl` still contains the characters of `s`.
- The variable `pk` is either a float or an integer equal to `n / 2`, depending on whether `n` is even or odd.
- The loop counter `i` has reached its final value, which is -1.
- The variable `ele` stores the last element in `lst`.
- The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are still valid, with `zero_perc` being an integer equal to `z * 100 // n`, and `one_perc` being an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`.
- The standard input `stdin` is empty.
- The variable `elem` stores the last element in the list.
- The list `final` contains all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`. If the percentage of '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` also contains 0. Otherwise, `final` also contains `n` and the percentage of '1' in `s` is less than 50. The first element of the final list is being printed.
