Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is 10^8, `lst` is a list with an additional element `i + 2`, `i` is 2, `zero` and `one` are integers. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1 and `zero_perc` is (`zero` + 1) * 100 // (`i` + 1). If `s[i]` is '1', `one` is increased by 1 and `one_perc` is (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1).**
