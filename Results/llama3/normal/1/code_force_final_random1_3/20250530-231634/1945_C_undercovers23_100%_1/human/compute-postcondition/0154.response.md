Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, o is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s, z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s plus one if s[i] is '0', otherwise z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s. zero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0. one is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0. If zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, then lst is a list containing n. Otherwise, lst is a list containing n and i + 1. mini is 10^8. sl is a list of characters of s. pk is a float equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer equal to n / 2 if n is odd. i is n - 1. ele is None. final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and the element is equal to mini. t is greater than 1. _ is 1. zero_perc is an integer equal to zero * 100 // (i + 1). one_perc is an integer equal to (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1).**

The code snippet calculates the percentages of zeros and ones in the string `s` up to the current index `i`. The `zero_perc` is calculated as the percentage of zeros encountered so far, and the `one_perc` is calculated as the percentage of ones encountered so far. These calculations do not modify any other variables or the state of the program. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as described in the initial state.
