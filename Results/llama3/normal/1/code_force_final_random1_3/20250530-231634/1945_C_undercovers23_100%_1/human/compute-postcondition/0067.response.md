Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state, which is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive. The string `s` also remains unchanged, with a length of `n` and consisting only of 0 and 1. The new variable `pk` is assigned the value of `n / 2`, which results in a float value between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive. The stdin remains empty as it was in the initial state.
