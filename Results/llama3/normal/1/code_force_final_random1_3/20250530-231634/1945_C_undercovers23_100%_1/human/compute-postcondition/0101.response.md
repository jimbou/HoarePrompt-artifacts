Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n` - 1 characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n` - 1 characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing all the indices `i` + 1 where the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero_perc` is `zero` * 100 // (`i` + 1), and `one_perc` is (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1), and `ele` is the third element in the list.**

The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
