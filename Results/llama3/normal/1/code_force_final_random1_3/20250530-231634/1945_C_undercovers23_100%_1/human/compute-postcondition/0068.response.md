Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive, stdin is empty**

In this output state, `pk` is assigned the value of `n` divided by 2. Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `pk` will be an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and stdin is still empty.
