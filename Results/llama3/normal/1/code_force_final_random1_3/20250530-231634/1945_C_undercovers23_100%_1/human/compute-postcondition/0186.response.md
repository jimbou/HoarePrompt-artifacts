Based on the precondition, the value of `final[0]` is the smallest element in the sorted list `final`. The list `final` contains all elements in `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`, and if `c1` is less than 50, it also contains `n`. Since `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and all elements in `lst`, the elements in `final` are the indices in `lst` that are closest to `n / 2`.

If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` also contains 0. In this case, since 0 is the smallest possible index, `final[0]` will be 0.

If `c1` is less than 50, `final` also contains `n`. In this case, since `n` is the largest possible index, `final[0]` will be the smallest element in `lst` that is closest to `n / 2`.

Therefore, the value of `final[0]` is either 0 or the smallest index in `lst` that is closest to `n / 2`.

Output: **0 or the smallest index in lst that is closest to n / 2**
