Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s` plus 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s` plus 1, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '1', otherwise it is 0 and has been incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1', `lst` is a list containing the integer 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' or '1' and the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50, and `i + 1`, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 10^8, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and `lst` has been appended with `i + 1` which is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `lst` has been appended with the value `i + 1`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
