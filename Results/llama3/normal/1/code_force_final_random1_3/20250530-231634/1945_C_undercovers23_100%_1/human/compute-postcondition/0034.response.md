Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer, sl is a list of characters of length n, o is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, z is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, mini is 10^8, lst is a list with additional elements i + 1, i is n - 2, zero is an integer, one is an integer, zero_perc is (zero * 100) // (n - 1), one_perc is ((o - one) * 100) // 1. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute any additional operations.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the following changes: 

- `i` is now `n - 2`, indicating that the loop has executed `n - 1` times.
- `zero` and `one` are integers that represent the count of '0' and '1' characters in the string `s` up to the second last character.
- `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0' characters in the string `s` up to the second last character, and `one_perc` is the percentage of '1' characters in the string `s` from the second last character to the end.
- `lst` is a list that contains additional elements `i + 1` for each iteration where `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
