Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to (`n` - 1) / 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`, but since `n` is an odd number, the result is a decimal value. However, since `pk` is assigned an integer value, the decimal part is truncated, and `pk` becomes (`n` - 1) / 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
