Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, o is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s, z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is 10^8, sl is a list of characters of s, stdin is empty, pk is a float equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer equal to n / 2 if n is odd, i is n - 2, zero_perc is 0, one_perc is (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), ele is None, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and the element is equal to mini, t is greater than 1, _ is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list containing `n` if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, otherwise it is an empty list, `mini` is 10^8, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 1`, `ele` is None, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`. `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0. `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0. If `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, then `lst` is a list containing `n`. Otherwise, `lst` is a list containing `n` and `i + 1`. `mini` is 10^8. `sl` is a list of characters of `s`. `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd. `i` is `n - 2`. `ele` is None. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`. `t` is greater than 1. `_` is 1. `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`. `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0. `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0. If `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, then `lst` is a list containing `n` and `i + 1`. Otherwise, `lst` is a list containing `n`, `i + 1` and `i + 1`. `mini` is 10^8. `sl` is a list of characters of `s`. `pk` is a float equal to `n` / 2 if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n` / 2 if `n` is odd. `i` is `n` - 1. `ele` is None. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`. `t` is greater than 1. `_` is 1. `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero` * 100 // (`i` + 1). `one_perc` is an integer equal to (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
