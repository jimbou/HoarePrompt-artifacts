Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s` plus one, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 10^8, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float equal to `n` / 2 if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n` / 2 if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 1`, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1), `ele` is None, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1.**

The value of `zero` has been incremented by 1, since the current value of `s[i]` is '0'. The other variables remain unchanged.
