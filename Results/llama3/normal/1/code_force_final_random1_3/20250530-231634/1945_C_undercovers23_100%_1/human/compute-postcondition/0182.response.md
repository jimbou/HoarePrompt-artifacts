Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is equal to `z`, `one` is equal to `o`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i` where `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `i` is -1, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `z * 100 // n`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`, `c1` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`, stdin is empty, `elem` is the last element in the list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`. Additionally, `c1` is less than 50***
