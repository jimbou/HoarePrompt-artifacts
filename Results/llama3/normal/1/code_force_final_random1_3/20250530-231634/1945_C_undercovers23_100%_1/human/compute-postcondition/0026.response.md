The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is 10^8, `lst` is a list with an additional element `i + 2`, `i` is 2, `zero` is an integer, `one` is an integer, `zero_perc` is `zero` * 100 // (`i` + 1), `one_perc` is (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1)**
