Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`. `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0. `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0. `lst` is a list containing `n` if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, otherwise it is a list containing `n` and `i + 1`. `mini` is 10^8. `sl` is a list of characters of `s`. `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd. `i` is `n - 2`. `ele` is None. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`. `t` is greater than 1. `_` is 1. `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**

The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`. The list `lst` now contains `n` and `n - 1` if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, otherwise it is a list containing `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
