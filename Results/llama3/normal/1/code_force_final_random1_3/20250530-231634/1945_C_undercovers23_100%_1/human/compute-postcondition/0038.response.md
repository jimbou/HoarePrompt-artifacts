Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list `lst`, and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in the list `lst`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero` is an integer, `one` is an integer, `zero_perc` is (`zero` * 100) // (`n` - 1), `one_perc` is ((`o` - `one`) * 100) // 1**

The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in the list `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
