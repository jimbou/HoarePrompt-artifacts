Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `n` is even, `pk` is an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive. If `n` is odd, `pk` is an integer equal to (`n` - 1) / 2.***
