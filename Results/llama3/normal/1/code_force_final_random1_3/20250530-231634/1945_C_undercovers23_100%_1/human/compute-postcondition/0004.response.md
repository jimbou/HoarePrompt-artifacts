Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`, which is an integer since `n` is even. The range of `pk` is between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive, which is half of the range of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
