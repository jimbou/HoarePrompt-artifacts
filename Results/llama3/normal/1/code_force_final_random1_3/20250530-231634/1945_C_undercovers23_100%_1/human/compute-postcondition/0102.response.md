Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, o is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s, z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s, zero is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first n - 1 characters of s, one is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first n - 1 characters of s, lst is a list containing all the indices i + 1 where the percentage of '0' and '1' in s is greater than or equal to 50, mini is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between pk and all elements in lst, sl is a list of characters of s, stdin is empty, pk is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is odd, i is n - 2, zero_perc is zero * 100 // (i + 1), and one_perc is (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), and ele is the last element in the list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variable `mini` and `ele`. The variable `mini` now holds the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, instead of just the first element. The variable `ele` now holds the last element in the list `lst`, instead of the first element.
