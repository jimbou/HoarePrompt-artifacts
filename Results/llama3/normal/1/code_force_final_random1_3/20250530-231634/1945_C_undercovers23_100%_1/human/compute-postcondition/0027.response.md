Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is 10^8, `lst` is a list with an additional element `i + 2`, `i` is 2, `zero` is an integer increased by 1, `one` is an integer, `zero_perc` is (`zero` + 1) * 100 // (`i` + 1), `one_perc` is (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1)**

In this output state, the value of `zero` has been increased by 1, and the value of `zero_perc` has been updated accordingly. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
