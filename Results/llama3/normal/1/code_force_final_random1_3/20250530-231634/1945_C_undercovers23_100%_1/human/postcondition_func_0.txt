This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string a of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It calculates the percentage of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the indices where the percentage of 0s and 1s is greater than or equal to 50%. It then finds the index that is closest to the middle of the string and prints the smallest such index. If no such index is found, it prints 0 if the percentage of 1s is greater than or equal to 50%, otherwise it prints the length of the string.
