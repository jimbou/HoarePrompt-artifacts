To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-2` (since the range is `n-1`).

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 10^8, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0**
