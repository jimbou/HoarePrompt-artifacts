Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is 10^8, `lst` is a list with an additional element `i + 2`, `i` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one_perc` is (`o` - one) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1), `one` is `one` + 1, and if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

The code increments the value of `one` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are still valid, but the value of `one_perc` may have changed due to the increment of `one`. If both `zero_perc` and the new value of `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
