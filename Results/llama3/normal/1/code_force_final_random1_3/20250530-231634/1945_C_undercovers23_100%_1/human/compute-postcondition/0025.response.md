Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer, sl is a list of characters of length n, o is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, z is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, mini is 10^8, lst is a list with an additional element i + 2, i is 1, zero is an integer, one is an integer, zero_perc is zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1). If the character at index i in string s is '0', zero is increased by 1. If the character at index i in string s is '1', one is increased by 1. If both zero_perc and one_perc are greater than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
