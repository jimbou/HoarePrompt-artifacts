Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing all the indices `i + 1` where the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`. If `final` is empty, then `final` contains an additional element 0 if the percentage of '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `n` is appended to the `final` list, and the first element of the `final` list is printed, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1.***
