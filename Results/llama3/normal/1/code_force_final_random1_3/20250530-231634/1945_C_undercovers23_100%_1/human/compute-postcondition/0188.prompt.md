Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n / 2
    else:
        pk = n / 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
        one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in the list `lst`, `lst` is a list of characters that must have at least `n` elements, `ele` is the last element in the list, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero` is an integer, `one` is an integer, `zero_perc` is (`zero` * 100) // (`n` - 1), `one_perc` is ((`o` - `one`) * 100) // 1, `c1` is an integer equal to (`o` * 100) // `n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the integer `n`, and the first element of `final` which is either 0 or `n` depending on the value of `c1` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing all the indices `i + 1` where the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`. If `final` is empty, then `final` contains an additional element 0 if the percentage of '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `n` is appended to the `final` list, and the first element of the `final` list is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is equal to `z`, `one` is equal to `o`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i` where `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `i` is -1, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `z * 100 // n`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`, stdin is empty, `elem` is the last element in the list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` also contains 0. Otherwise, `final` also contains `n` and `c1` is less than 50, and the first element of the final list is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
