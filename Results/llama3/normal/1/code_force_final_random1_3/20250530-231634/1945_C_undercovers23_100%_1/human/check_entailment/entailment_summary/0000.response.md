Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid. It calculates the percentage of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the indices where the percentage of 0s and 1s is greater than or equal to 50%. It then finds the index that is closest to the middle of the string and prints the smallest such index. If no such index is found, it prints 0 if the percentage of 1s is greater than or equal to 50%, otherwise it prints the length of the string.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including the case where the length of the string is even or odd, and the case where the percentage of 0s or 1s is exactly 50%.

Correctness: **True**
