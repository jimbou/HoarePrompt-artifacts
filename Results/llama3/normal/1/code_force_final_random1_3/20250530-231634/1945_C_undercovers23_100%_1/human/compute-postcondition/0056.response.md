Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in the list `lst`, `lst` is a list of characters that must have at least `n` elements, `ele` is the last element in the list, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero` is an integer, `one` is an integer, `zero_perc` is (`zero` * 100) // (`n` - 1), `one_perc` is ((`o` - `one`) * 100) // 1, `final` is an empty list, `elem` does not exist, and `c1` is an integer equal to (`o` * 100) // `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `c1` which is calculated as the integer division of `o` multiplied by 100 and `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
