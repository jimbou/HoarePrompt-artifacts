Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`. `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0. `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0. If `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, then `lst` is a list containing `n` and `i + 1`. Otherwise, `lst` is a list containing `n`, `i + 1` and `i + 1`. `mini` is 10^8. `sl` is a list of characters of `s`. `pk` is a float equal to `n` / 2 if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n` / 2 if `n` is odd. `i` is `n` - 1. `ele` is None. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`. `t` is greater than 1. `_` is 1. `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero` * 100 // (`i` + 1). `one_perc` is an integer equal to (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1).**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `lst` now contains `n` and `i + 1`, where `i` is `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
