Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, o is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s, z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s, zero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is 10^8, sl is a list of characters of s, stdin is empty, pk is a float equal to n / 2 if n is even, or an integer equal to n / 2 if n is odd, i is n - 1, zero_perc is zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), ele is None, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and the element is equal to mini, t is greater than 1, _ is 1.**

The code modifies the values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc`. The first line calculates `zero_perc` as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, where `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, and `i` is `n - 1`. The second line calculates `one_perc` as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, where `o` is the number of '1' in `s`, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0, and `n` is the length of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
