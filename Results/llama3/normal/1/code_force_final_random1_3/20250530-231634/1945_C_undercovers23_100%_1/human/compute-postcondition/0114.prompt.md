Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing all the indices `i + 1` where the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `ele` is the last element in the list, and `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least 1 element, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `elem` is the first element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element of `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `elem` is the second element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element of `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and the second element of `lst`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `elem` is the third element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element of `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`, the second element of `lst`, and the third element of `lst`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`, the second element of `lst`, and the third element of `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
