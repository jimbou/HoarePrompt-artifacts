Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is equal to `z`, `one` is equal to `o`, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 index `i` where `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the first element in `lst` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `i` is -1, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `z * 100 // n`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`, stdin is empty**

The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst`. This means that `mini` now represents the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the first element in `lst` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
