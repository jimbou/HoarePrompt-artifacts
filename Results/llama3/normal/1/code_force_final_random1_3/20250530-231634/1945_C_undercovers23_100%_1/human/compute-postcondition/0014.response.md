Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is 10^8, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', then `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.***
