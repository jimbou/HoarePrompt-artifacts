Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, o is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s, z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s, zero is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first n - 1 characters of s, one is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first n - 1 characters of s, lst is a list containing all the indices i + 1 where the percentage of '0' and '1' in s is greater than or equal to 50, mini is 10^8, sl is a list of characters of s, stdin is empty, pk is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is odd, i is n - 2, zero_perc is zero * 100 // (i + 1), and one_perc is (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire string `s` (except the last character), and the variables `zero` and `one` now represent the count of '0' and '1' in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, respectively. The list `lst` contains all the indices `i+1` where the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50. The other variables remain unchanged.
