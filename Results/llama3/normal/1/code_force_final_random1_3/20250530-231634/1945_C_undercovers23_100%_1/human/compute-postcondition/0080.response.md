Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, o is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s, z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s, zero is 1 if the first character of s is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if the first character of s is '1', otherwise it is 0, lst is a list containing the integer 1 if the first character of s is '0' or '1' and the percentage of '0' and '1' in s is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise lst is an empty list, mini is 10^8, sl is a list of characters of s, stdin is empty, pk is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is odd, i is 0, zero_perc is 100 if the first character of s is '0', otherwise it is 0, one_perc is 100 * (o - one) / (n - 1), and the first character of s is either '0' or '1'.***
