Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer, sl is a list of characters of length n, o is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, z is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is 10^8, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is 10^8, `lst` is a list with an additional element `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one_perc` is (`o` - one) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1). If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer, sl is a list of characters of length n, o is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, z is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, mini is 10^8, lst is a list with an additional element i + 2, i is 1, zero is an integer, one is an integer, zero_perc is zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1). If the character at index i in string s is '0', zero is increased by 1. If the character at index i in string s is '1', one is increased by 1. If both zero_perc and one_perc are greater than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 3, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer, sl is a list of characters of length n, o is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, z is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, mini is 10^8, lst is a list with an additional element i + 2 which is 4, i is 2, zero is an integer, one is an integer, zero_perc is (zero * 100) // (i + 1) which is (zero * 100) // 3, one_perc is ((o - one) * 100) // (n - i - 1) which is ((o - one) * 100) // (n - 3). If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute any additional operations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
