The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, lst has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `elem` is the third element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element of `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`, the second element of `lst` and the third element of `lst`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and the second element of `lst`.**
