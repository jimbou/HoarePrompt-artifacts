Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list containing `n`, `mini` is 10^8, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `ele` is None, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `lst` now contains the value `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
