Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer, sl is a list of characters of length n, o is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, z is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, mini is 10^8, lst is a list with additional elements i + 1, i is n - 2, zero is an integer, one is an integer, zero_perc is (zero * 100) // (n - 1), one_perc is ((o - one) * 100) // 1. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute any additional operations.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list `lst`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero` is an integer, `one` is an integer, `zero_perc` is (`zero` * 100) // (`n` - 1), `one_perc` is ((`o` - `one`) * 100) // 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list `lst`, and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in the list `lst`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero` is an integer, `one` is an integer, `zero_perc` is (`zero` * 100) // (`n` - 1), `one_perc` is ((`o` - `one`) * 100) // 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer, `sl` is a list of characters of length `n`, `o` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `z` is an integer between 0 and `n` inclusive, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list `lst`, and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in the list `lst`, and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in the list `lst`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero` is an integer, `one` is an integer, `zero_perc` is (`zero` * 100) // (`n` - 1), `one_perc` is ((`o` - `one`) * 100) // 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
