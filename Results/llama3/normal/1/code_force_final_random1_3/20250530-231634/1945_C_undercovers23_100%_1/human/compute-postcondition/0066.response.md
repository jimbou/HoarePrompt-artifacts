Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, stdin is empty**.

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1. After these two lines, stdin is empty because both inputs have been consumed. All other variables remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code.
