Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, o is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s, z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s, zero is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first n - 1 characters of s, one is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first n - 1 characters of s, lst is a list containing all the indices i + 1 where the percentage of '0' and '1' in s is greater than or equal to 50, mini is 10^8, sl is a list of characters of s, stdin is empty, pk is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is odd, i is n - 2, zero_perc is zero * 100 // (i + 1), and one_perc is (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1).
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n` - 1 characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n` - 1 characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing all the indices `i` + 1 where the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 1 element, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero_perc` is `zero` * 100 // (`i` + 1), and `one_perc` is (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1), and `ele` is the first element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n` - 1 characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n` - 1 characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing all the indices `i` + 1 where the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero_perc` is `zero` * 100 // (`i` + 1), and `one_perc` is (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1), and `ele` is the second element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in the first `n` - 1 characters of `s`, `one` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in the first `n` - 1 characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing all the indices `i` + 1 where the percentage of '0' and '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is `n` - 2, `zero_perc` is `zero` * 100 // (`i` + 1), and `one_perc` is (`o` - `one`) * 100 // (`n` - `i` - 1), and `ele` is the third element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
