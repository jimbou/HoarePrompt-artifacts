To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in lst:`. The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the last element in the list.

For the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` must be the next element in the list. Since `elem` is the last element in the list, the next element does not exist. However, we can adjust the state of `elem` to be the next element in the list if we assume that the list has at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s`, `zero` is equal to `z`, `one` is equal to `o`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i` where `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50 that must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 10^8 and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and all elements in `lst`, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `pk` is a float equal to `n / 2` if `n` is even, or an integer equal to `n / 2` if `n` is odd, `i` is -1, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `z * 100 // n`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`, stdin is empty, `elem` is the third element in the list. If `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element in `lst` and the third element in the list. Otherwise, `final` is an empty list.**
