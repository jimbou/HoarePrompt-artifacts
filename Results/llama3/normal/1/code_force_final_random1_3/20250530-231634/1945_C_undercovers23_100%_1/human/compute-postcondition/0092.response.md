Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, o is an integer equal to the number of '1' in s, z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s plus 2 if s[i] is '0', otherwise z is an integer equal to the number of '0' in s plus 1, zero is 1 if the first character of s is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if the first character of s is '1', otherwise it is 0 and has been incremented by 1 if s[i] is '1', lst is a list containing the integer 1 if the first character of s is '0' or '1' and the percentage of '0' and '1' in s is greater than or equal to 50, and i + 1, otherwise lst is an empty list, mini is 10^8, sl is a list of characters of s, stdin is empty, pk is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if n is odd, i is 2, zero_perc is zero * 100 // (i + 1), and one_perc is (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1).**

The code snippet provided does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. The two lines of code calculate the values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` based on the existing values of `zero`, `i`, `o`, `one`, and `n`, but these calculations do not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the calculated values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc`.
