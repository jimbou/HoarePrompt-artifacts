Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid. The program iterates through the string `s` and checks if the percentage of zeros on the left side and the percentage of ones on the right side are both greater than or equal to 50. If this condition is met, it adds the current index to the list `lst`. Then, it finds the minimum absolute difference between the middle of the village (`pk`) and the indices in `lst`. If there are multiple indices with the same minimum difference, it chooses the smallest one. If no such index is found, it checks if the percentage of ones in the entire village is greater than or equal to 50, and if so, it adds 0 to the list `final`. Otherwise, it adds `n` to the list `final`. Finally, it prints the first element of the sorted list `final`.

Correctness: **True**
