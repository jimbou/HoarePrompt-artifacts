Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive and must be at least 3, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer, sl is a list of characters of length n, o is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, z is an integer between 0 and n inclusive, mini is 10^8, lst is a list with an additional element i + 2 which is 4, i is 2, zero is an integer, one is an integer, zero_perc is (zero * 100) // (i + 1) which is (zero * 100) // 3, one_perc is ((o - one) * 100) // (n - i - 1) which is ((o - one) * 100) // (n - 3). If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute any additional operations.***
