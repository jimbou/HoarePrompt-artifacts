Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `o` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `s`, `z` is an integer equal to the number of '0' in `s` minus 1, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 10^8, `sl` is a list of characters of `s`, `stdin` is empty, `pk` is a float between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is even, or an integer between 1.5 and 1.5*10^5 inclusive if `n` is odd, `i` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `zero` has been incremented by 1, since the current value of `s[i]` is '0'. The other variables remain unchanged.
