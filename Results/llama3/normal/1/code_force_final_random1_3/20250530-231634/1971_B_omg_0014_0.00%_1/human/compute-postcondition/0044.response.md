Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), i is n-1, s is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters, stdin is empty. If the size of set a is 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed. If b is equal to s, then c (a string of reverse sorted lowercase English letters) is printed. Otherwise, b (a string of sorted lowercase English letters) is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `n-1`, and the input buffer (`stdin`) will be empty because all input strings have been processed. The variables `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values corresponding to the last string processed by the loop. If the last string contains exactly two unique letters, 'NO' will be printed; otherwise, 'YES' will be printed, followed by either the sorted or reverse-sorted version of the last string, depending on whether the original string was already sorted.
