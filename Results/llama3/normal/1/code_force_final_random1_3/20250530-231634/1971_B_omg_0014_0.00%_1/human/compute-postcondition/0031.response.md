The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **n is a positive integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters, stdin contains n-3 strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10. If the size of set a is 2, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed. If b is equal to s, then c (a string of reverse sorted lowercase English letters) is printed. Otherwise, b (a string of sorted lowercase English letters) is printed.**
