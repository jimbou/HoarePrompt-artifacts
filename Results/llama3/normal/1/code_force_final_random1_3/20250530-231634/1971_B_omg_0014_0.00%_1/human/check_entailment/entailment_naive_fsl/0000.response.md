Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string has more than two distinct characters, but all characters are in ascending or descending order. In this case, the program will print the same string, which is not a rearrangement of the original string.

For example, if the input is "abcdef", the program will print "YES" and then print "abcdef" again, which is not a rearrangement of the original string.

The program should check if the string is already sorted in ascending or descending order, and if so, it should try to find a different rearrangement.
