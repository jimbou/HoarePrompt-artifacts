Functionality: **This function reads a positive integer t from standard input, followed by t strings of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if the string contains exactly two unique letters. If it does, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the string in either sorted or reverse sorted order, depending on whether the original string was already sorted. The function processes all input strings and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
