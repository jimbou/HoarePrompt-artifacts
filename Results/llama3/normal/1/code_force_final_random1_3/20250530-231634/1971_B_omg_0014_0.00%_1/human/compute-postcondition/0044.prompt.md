Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters, stdin contains n-1 strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10. If a contains exactly 2 unique lowercase English letters, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, b is a string of sorted lowercase English letters, c is a string of reverse sorted lowercase English letters. If b is equal to s, then c is printed. Otherwise, b is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters, stdin contains n-3 strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10. If the size of set a is 2, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed. If b is equal to s, then c (a string of reverse sorted lowercase English letters) is printed. Otherwise, b (a string of sorted lowercase English letters) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters, stdin contains n-4 strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10. If the size of set a is 2, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed. If b is equal to s, then the string c is being printed. Otherwise, a string of sorted lowercase English letters of length at most 10 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
