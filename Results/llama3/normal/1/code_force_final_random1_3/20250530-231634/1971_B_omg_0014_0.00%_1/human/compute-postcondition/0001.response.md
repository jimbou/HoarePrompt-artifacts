According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. So, `n` does not need to be adjusted. The only other variable in the loop head is `i`, which is initialized to 0 before the loop starts. So, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains `n` strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
