The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input from stdin to `n`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, the value of `n` will be this positive integer `t`.

The value of `t` is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), so `n` will also be between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining inputs in stdin will be `t` strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.**
