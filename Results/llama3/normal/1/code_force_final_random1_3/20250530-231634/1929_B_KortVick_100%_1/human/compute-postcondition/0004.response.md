The code prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`. Based on the precondition, the current value of `k` equals 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2, which can be expressed as `k = 4n - 2`.

To evaluate the expression `k // 2 + 1`, we can substitute the value of `k` with `4n - 2`:

`k // 2 + 1` = `(4n - 2) // 2 + 1`

Since `n` is an integer, we can simplify the expression:

`(4n - 2) // 2` = `2n - 1`

Adding 1 to the result:

`2n - 1 + 1` = `2n`

Therefore, the code prints the value of `2n`, where `n` is the current value of `n`.

Output: **2n (where n is the current value of n)**
