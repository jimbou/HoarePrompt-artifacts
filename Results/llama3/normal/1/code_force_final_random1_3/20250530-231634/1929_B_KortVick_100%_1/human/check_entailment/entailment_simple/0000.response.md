Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The given program first reads the number of test cases t and then for each test case, it reads the size of the square grid n and the minimum number of diagonals k.

The program then checks if the total number of diagonals (4n - 2) is equal to k. If it is, it prints k // 2 + 1, which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover all diagonals. This is because each diagonal can be covered by coloring one cell, and there are k // 2 diagonals that can be covered by coloring one cell. The remaining diagonal can be covered by coloring one more cell.

If the total number of diagonals is not equal to k, the program prints ceil(k / 2), which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover at least k diagonals. This is because each diagonal can be covered by coloring one cell, and there are k // 2 diagonals that can be covered by coloring one cell. The remaining diagonals can be covered by coloring one more cell, which is achieved by taking the ceiling of k / 2.

The program correctly handles the cases where k is equal to the total number of diagonals and where k is less than the total number of diagonals.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
