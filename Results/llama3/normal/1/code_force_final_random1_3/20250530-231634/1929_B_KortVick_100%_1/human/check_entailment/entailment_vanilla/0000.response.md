Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The program provided uses the following logic:

- If k is equal to the total number of diagonals (4n - 2), it prints k // 2 + 1. This is because in this case, all diagonals need to be colored, and the minimum number of cells required to color all diagonals is k // 2 + 1 (since each diagonal has two cells that can be colored).

- If k is not equal to the total number of diagonals, it prints ceil(k / 2). This is because in this case, not all diagonals need to be colored, and the minimum number of cells required to color k diagonals is ceil(k / 2) (since each diagonal has two cells that can be colored, but we only need to color one cell per diagonal).

This logic is correct, and the program should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
