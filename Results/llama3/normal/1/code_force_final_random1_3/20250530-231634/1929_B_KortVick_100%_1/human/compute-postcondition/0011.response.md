Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are updated according to the input values. The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), and the value of `k` is now an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).
