Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). If the current value of `k` equals 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2, then the value of k // 2 + 1 which is equal to 2n is printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of k divided by 2 is being printed.***
