To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` since it's the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2)**
