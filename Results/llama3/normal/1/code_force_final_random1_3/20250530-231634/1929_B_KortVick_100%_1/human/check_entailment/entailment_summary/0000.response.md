Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n to have at least one colored cell in k diagonals. The program correctly handles multiple test cases and calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case.

The program uses the formula `ceil(k / 2)` to calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored when `k` is less than `4 * n - 2`. This formula is correct because each diagonal can be colored with at least one cell, and the number of diagonals is `k`. When `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2`, the program uses the formula `k // 2 + 1` to calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored. This formula is also correct because all diagonals need to be colored, and the number of diagonals is `4 * n - 2`.

The program correctly handles the edge case where `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2` by using a separate formula to calculate the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
