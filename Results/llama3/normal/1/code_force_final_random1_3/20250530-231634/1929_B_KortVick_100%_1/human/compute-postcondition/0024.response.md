Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), where `n` represents the size of the square grid and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the loop has executed `t` times. The values of `n` and `k` are still integers between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive) and 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), respectively. The loop has printed the value of `k // 2 + 1` if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, or the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 otherwise, for each iteration.
