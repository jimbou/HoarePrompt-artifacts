The code prints the value of `k // 2 + 1`, which is the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), the value of `k // 2 + 1` will be an integer between 1 and 2n (inclusive).

Output: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), and the value of `k // 2 + 1` which is an integer between 1 and 2n (inclusive) is being printed**
