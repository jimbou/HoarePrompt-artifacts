Output: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). Additionally, 4n - 2 is not equal to k, and the ceiling of k divided by 2 is being printed**
