Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2), where `n` represents the size of the square grid and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the size of the square grid and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell. The values of `n` and `k` are still unknown, but they are constrained to be within the ranges 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2, respectively.
