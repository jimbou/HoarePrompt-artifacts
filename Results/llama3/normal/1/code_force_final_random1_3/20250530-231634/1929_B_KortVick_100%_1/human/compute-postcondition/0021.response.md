The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), the value of `k / 2` will be a floating-point number. The `ceil` function will round this value up to the nearest integer.

Output: **the ceiling of k / 2 (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2)**
