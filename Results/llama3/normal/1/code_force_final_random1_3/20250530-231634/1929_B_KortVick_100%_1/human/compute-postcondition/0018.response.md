Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1. The value of `n` is now the first integer from the input, which is between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive). The value of `k` is now the second integer from the input, which is between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).
