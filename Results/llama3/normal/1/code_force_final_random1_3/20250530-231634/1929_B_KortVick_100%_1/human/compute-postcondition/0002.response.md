Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2)**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the first two integers from the input, which are between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive) and between 1 and 4n - 2 (inclusive), respectively. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
