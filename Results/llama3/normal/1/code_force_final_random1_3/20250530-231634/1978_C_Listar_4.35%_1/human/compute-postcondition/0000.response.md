Output State: **`n` and `k` are returned by `func_2()`**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_2()`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are no longer valid. The function `func_2()` is assumed to return two non-negative integer values, which are assigned to `n` and `k` respectively.
