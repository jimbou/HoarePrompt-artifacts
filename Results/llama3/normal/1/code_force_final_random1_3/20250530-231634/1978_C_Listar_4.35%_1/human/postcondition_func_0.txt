Rearranges the elements of a list of integers from 1 to n in ascending order, based on the value of a non-negative integer k, and returns the rearranged list. If k is 0, the original list is returned. Otherwise, the function performs a series of rotations on the list, moving the last element to a position determined by k, until k becomes 0. The final state of the program is a list containing all integers from 1 to n in ascending order, with k being 0.
