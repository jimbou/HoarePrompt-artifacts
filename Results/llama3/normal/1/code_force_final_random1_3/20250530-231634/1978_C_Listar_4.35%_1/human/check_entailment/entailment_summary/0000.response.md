Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions are consistent with the expected behavior.

The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`. 

`func_1` rearranges the elements of a list of integers from 1 to n in ascending order, based on the value of a non-negative integer k, and returns the rearranged list. If k is 0, the original list is returned. Otherwise, the function performs a series of rotations on the list, moving the last element to a position determined by k, until k becomes 0.

`func_2` takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input from the user, where `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive) and `k` is between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). If `k` is odd, the function immediately returns two zeros. If `k` is even, it calculates the maximum possible value of `k` based on `n` and checks if the input `k` is within this limit. If `k` exceeds this limit, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original `n` and `k` values.

`func_3` prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the input list, one integer per line, and returns no value.

`func_4` determines whether to print 'NO' or return a value based on the value of `n` returned by `func_2()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns nothing. If `n` is not 0, it calls `func_1(n, k)` and `func_3(l)`, and returns the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`.

The program's main logic is in `func_4`, which calls `func_2` to validate the input and calculate the maximum possible value of `k`. If the input `k` is valid, it calls `func_1` to rearrange the list of integers and then calls `func_3` to print the result. If the input `k` is invalid, it prints 'NO'.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions are consistent with the expected behavior. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
