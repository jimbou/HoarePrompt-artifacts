This function takes two integers, `n` and `k`, as input from the user, where `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive) and `k` is between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). If `k` is odd, the function immediately returns two zeros. If `k` is even, it calculates the maximum possible value of `k` based on `n` and checks if the input `k` is within this limit. If `k` exceeds this limit, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original `n` and `k` values.
