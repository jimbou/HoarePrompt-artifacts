Output State: **n and k are returned by func_2(), n is not equal to 0, l is the value returned by func_1(n, k)**

The code executes two function calls. The first line assigns the return value of `func_1(n, k)` to `l`. Since `n` and `k` are returned by `func_2()`, and `n` is not equal to 0, the value of `l` is determined by the output of `func_1()` for the given inputs `n` and `k`. The second line calls `func_3(l)`, but since the return value of `func_3()` is not assigned to any variable, it does not affect the state of the program. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
