Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, when the input is n = 5 and k = 12, the program outputs "Yes" and the permutation [5, 4, 3, 1, 2]. However, the Manhattan value of this permutation is |5 - 1| + |4 - 2| + |3 - 3| + |1 - 4| + |2 - 5| = 4 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 3 = 12, which is not equal to k = 12. 

This is because the program does not correctly calculate the Manhattan value of the permutation. The program only checks if the maximum possible Manhattan value is greater than or equal to k, but it does not check if the actual Manhattan value of the permutation is equal to k. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
