Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a permutation of length n with a Manhattan value equal to k. The program consists of four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4.

Func_1 generates a permutation with a Manhattan value equal to k by swapping elements in the list. It starts from the end of the list and swaps elements until k becomes 0.

Func_2 checks if it is possible to generate a permutation with a Manhattan value equal to k. It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given n and checks if k is less than or equal to this value. If k is greater than the maximum possible value, it returns 0, indicating that it is not possible to generate such a permutation.

Func_3 prints the permutation generated by func_1.

Func_4 is the main function that calls func_2 to check if it is possible to generate a permutation with a Manhattan value equal to k. If it is possible, it calls func_1 to generate the permutation and then calls func_3 to print the permutation. If it is not possible, it prints "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It checks if it is possible to generate a permutation with a Manhattan value equal to k and generates the permutation if it is possible. If it is not possible, it prints "NO".

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
