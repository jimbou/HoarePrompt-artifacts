Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a permutation of length n with a Manhattan value equal to k. The program consists of four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4.

Func_1 takes two parameters, n and k, and rearranges the elements of a list of integers from 1 to n in ascending order based on the value of k. If k is 0, the original list is returned. Otherwise, the function performs a series of rotations on the list, moving the last element to a position determined by k, until k becomes 0.

Func_2 takes two integers, n and k, as input from the user and checks if k is within the maximum possible value based on n. If k is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original n and k values.

Func_3 prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the input list and returns no value.

Func_4 determines whether to print 'NO' or return a value based on the value of n returned by func_2. If n is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns nothing. If n is not 0, it calls func_1(n, k) and func_3(l), and returns the value returned by func_1(n, k).

The program correctly implements the logic to find a permutation with a Manhattan value equal to k. It first checks if k is within the maximum possible value based on n, and if not, it prints 'NO'. If k is within the maximum possible value, it rearranges the elements of the list to find a permutation with a Manhattan value equal to k and prints 'YES' followed by the permutation.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
