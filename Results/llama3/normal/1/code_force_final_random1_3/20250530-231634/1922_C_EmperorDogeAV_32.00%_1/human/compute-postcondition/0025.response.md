Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 3, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. back is the value of the i-1th element of the cities list, forward is 99999999.**

In this output state, the value of `back` has been updated to be the value of the `i-1`th element of the `cities` list. The values of the other variables remain the same. The `cities` list is still a list of `n` non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is still a positive integer that must be at least `i + 3`, `prog_cities` is still a list of `n-1` integers, and `forward` is still `99999999`.
