Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999
    forward = 99999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least 2. If the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1 is less than the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i-1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is 1 and the rest are 0. Otherwise, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the value of the city at index i+1. If the current value of i is greater than 0, back is the value of the city at index i-1. If the current value of i is less than n - 1, forward is the value of the city at index i+1. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, otherwise back is -99999999. If i is less than n-1, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, forward is 99999999. The ith element of prog_cities is 1 if the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 3, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0, back is the value of the i-1th element of the cities list, otherwise back is -99999999. If i is less than n - 1, forward is the value of the i+1th element of the cities list. Otherwise, forward is 99999999. The ith element of prog_cities is 1 if the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the forward is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the back. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the forward.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
