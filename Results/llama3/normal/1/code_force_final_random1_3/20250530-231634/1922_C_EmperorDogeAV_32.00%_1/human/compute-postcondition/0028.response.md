Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 3, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0, back is the value of the i-1th element of the cities list, otherwise back is -99999999. If i is less than n - 1, forward is the value of the i+1th element of the cities list. Otherwise, forward is 99999999.***
