Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities, If i is larger than 0, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, otherwise back is -99999999. If i is less than n-1, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, forward is 99999999.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, the number of cities is still at least i + 2, and the list of progressive cities has been updated such that the ith element is now the absolute difference between the (i+1)th city and the ith city. The values of back and forward remain the same as before, depending on the value of i.
