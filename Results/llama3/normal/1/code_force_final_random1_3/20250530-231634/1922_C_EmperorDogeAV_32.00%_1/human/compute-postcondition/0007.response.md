Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, if the current value of i is greater than 0, back is the value of the city at index i-1 and forward is the value of the city at index i+1. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged. The current value of i is less than n - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `forward` has been updated to be the value of the city at index `i+1` in the `cities` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `i` is less than `n-1` is still valid, as the code does not modify the value of `i`.
