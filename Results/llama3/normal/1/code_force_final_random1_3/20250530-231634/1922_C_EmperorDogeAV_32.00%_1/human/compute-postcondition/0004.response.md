Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, the current value of i is greater than 0, back is the value of the city at index i-1, and forward is 99999999.**

In this output state, the value of the variable "back" has been updated to be the value of the city at index i-1 in the list "cities". The other variables remain unchanged. The list "cities" is still in ascending order, and the list "prog_cities" is still a list of n-1 zeros. The value of "i" is still greater than 0, and the value of "forward" is still 99999999.
