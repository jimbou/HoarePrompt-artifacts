Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, otherwise back is -99999999. forward is the (i+1)th element of cities.**

In this output state, the value of `forward` has been updated to be the (i+1)th element of `cities`, which is a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `cities` is still in ascending order, and `n` is still a positive integer that must be at least `i + 2`. The list `prog_cities` is unchanged, and the value of `back` is still dependent on the value of `i`.
