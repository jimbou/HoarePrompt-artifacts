Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the value of the city at index i+1, If the current value of i is greater than 0, back is the value of the city at index i-1. If the current value of i is less than n - 1, forward is the value of the city at index i+1. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged. The absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the value of the city at index i+1 is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the value of the city at index i-1.**

In this output state, the value of prog_cities at index i has been updated to be the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the value of the city at index i+1. The other variables remain unchanged.
