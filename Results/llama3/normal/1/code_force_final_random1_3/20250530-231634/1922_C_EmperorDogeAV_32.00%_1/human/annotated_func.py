    #State: cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. For each index i in the range of n-1, if the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1 is less than the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i-1, the ith element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of n-1 integers, where each integer represents the absolute difference between consecutive cities in the list 'cities', or 1 if the difference is less than the previous difference. The list is in the same order as the original list 'cities'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order and returns a list of n-1 integers, where each integer represents the absolute difference between consecutive cities in the input list, or 1 if the difference is less than the previous difference. The returned list is in the same order as the original list.
