Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, the number of cities, and the coordinates of the cities.

2. It then calculates the closest city for each city in both the forward and backward directions using the `func_1` function. This function correctly determines the closest city for each city by comparing the distances to the previous and next cities.

3. The program then calculates the prefix sum of the distances in both the forward and backward directions. This is done to efficiently calculate the total distance between any two cities.

4. Finally, the program reads the queries and calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel between the specified cities. It does this by subtracting the prefix sum of the distances up to the starting city from the prefix sum of the distances up to the ending city. This correctly gives the total distance between the two cities.

5. The program handles the case where the starting city is to the left of the ending city and the case where the starting city is to the right of the ending city correctly.

6. The program also handles the case where the starting city is the same as the ending city correctly, although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
