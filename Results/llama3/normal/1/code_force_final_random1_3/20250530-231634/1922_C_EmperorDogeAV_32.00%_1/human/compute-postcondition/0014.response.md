The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n - 1`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, back is the value of the city at index i, forward is the value of the city at index i+1**
