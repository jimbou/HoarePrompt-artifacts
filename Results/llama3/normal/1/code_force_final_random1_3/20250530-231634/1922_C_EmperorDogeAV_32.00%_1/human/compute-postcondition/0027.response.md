Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 3, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0, back is the value of the i-1th element of the cities list, otherwise back is -99999999. forward is the value of the i+1th element of the cities list.**

In this output state, the value of `forward` has been updated to be the value of the `i+1th` element of the `cities` list. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
