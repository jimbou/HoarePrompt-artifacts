Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least 2. If the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1 is less than the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i-1, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is 1 and the rest are 0. Otherwise, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the value at index i is the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the value of the city at index i+1. If the current value of i is greater than 0, back is the value of the city at index i-1. If the current value of i is less than n - 1, forward is the value of the city at index i+1. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged.***
