Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another. It first calculates the closest city for each city and then uses dynamic programming to calculate the prefix sum of the distances. This allows it to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins required for each query.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the source and destination cities are the same, when the source city is the first city, and when the destination city is the last city. It also correctly handles the case when the closest city is the next city or the previous city.

The program's time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the number of cities and m is the number of queries, which is efficient for the given constraints. The space complexity is also O(n), which is reasonable for the given constraints.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it should work correctly for all possible inputs.
