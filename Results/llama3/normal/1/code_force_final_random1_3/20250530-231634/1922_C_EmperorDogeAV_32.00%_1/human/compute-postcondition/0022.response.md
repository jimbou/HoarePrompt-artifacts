Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, otherwise back is -99999999. If i is less than n-1, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, forward is 99999999. The ith element of prog_cities is 1 if the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities.***
