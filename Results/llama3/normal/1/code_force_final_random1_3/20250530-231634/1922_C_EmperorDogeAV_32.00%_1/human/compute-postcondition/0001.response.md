To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range is `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, i is 0**
