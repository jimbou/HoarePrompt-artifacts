Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers, back is -99999999, forward is 99999999**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a new value to the variables `back` and `forward`. The initial state provides information about the variables `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, `back`, and `forward`. After executing the code, the values of `back` and `forward` are updated.

The first line assigns the value `-99999999` to `back`, overriding its previous value, which was the value of the city at index `i`. The second line assigns the value `99999999` to `forward`, overriding its previous value, which was the value of the city at index `i+1`.

The variables `cities`, `n`, and `prog_cities` are not affected by the code and retain their initial values. The list `cities` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` remains a positive integer that must be at least `i + 2`, and `prog_cities` remains a list of `n-1` integers.

In summary, the code updates the values of `back` and `forward` to `-99999999` and `99999999`, respectively, while leaving the other variables unchanged.
