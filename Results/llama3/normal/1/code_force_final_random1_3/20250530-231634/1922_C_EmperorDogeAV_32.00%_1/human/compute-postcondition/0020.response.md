Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is 1, If i is larger than 0, back is the (i-1)th element of cities, otherwise back is -99999999. If i is less than n-1, forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. Otherwise, forward is 99999999.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, the number of cities is still at least i + 2, and the list of progressive cities now has the ith element set to 1. The values of the back and forward variables remain the same, depending on the value of i.
