Output State: **`cities` is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least `i + 3`, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the `i`th element is the absolute difference between the `i+1`th element of `cities` and the `i`th element of `cities`, `back` is the value of the `i-1`th element of the `cities` list if `i` is larger than 0, otherwise -99999999, `forward` is the value of the `i+1`th element of the `cities` list if `i` is less than `n - 1`, otherwise 99999999.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the `i+1`th element of `cities` and the `i`th element of `cities`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
