Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros**.

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities` is a list of `n-1` zeros, where `n` is a positive integer. The values of `cities` and `n` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The list `prog_cities` is a new variable that has been initialized with `n-1` zeros.
