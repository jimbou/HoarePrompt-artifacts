Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 3, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers where the ith element is 1, If i is larger than 0, back is the value of the i-1th element of the cities list, otherwise back is -99999999. If i is less than n - 1, forward is the value of the i+1th element of the cities list. Otherwise, forward is 99999999.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, the number of cities is still at least i + 3, and the list of progressive cities now has 1 at the ith position. The values of the back and forward variables remain the same, depending on the value of i.
