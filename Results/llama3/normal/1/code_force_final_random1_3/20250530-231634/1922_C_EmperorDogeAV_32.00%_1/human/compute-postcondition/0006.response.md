Postcondition: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, if the current value of i is greater than 0, back is the value of the city at index i-1 and forward is 99999999. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged. The current value of i is less than n - 1.**
