Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. For each index i in the range of n-1, if the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1 is less than the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i-1, the ith element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the city at index i and the city at index i+1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list of cities remains unchanged, and the list of prog_cities will have its elements set based on the comparison of the absolute differences between adjacent cities. If the difference between a city and its next city is less than the difference between the city and its previous city, the corresponding element in prog_cities will be 1. Otherwise, it will be the absolute difference between the city and its next city.
