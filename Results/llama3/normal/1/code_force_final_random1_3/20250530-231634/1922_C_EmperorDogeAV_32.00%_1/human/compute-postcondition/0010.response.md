Output State: **`cities` is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where the i-th element is 1 and the rest are 0, if the current value of `i` is greater than 0, `back` is the value of the city at index `i-1`, if the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1`, `forward` is the value of the city at index `i+1`, otherwise, the values of `back` and `forward` remain unchanged, the absolute difference between the `forward` city and the city at index `i` is less than the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the `back` city.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to 1, indicating that the city at index `i` has been processed. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships.
