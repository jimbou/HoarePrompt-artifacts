Postcondition: ***cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least i + 3, prog_cities is a list of n-1 integers. If i is larger than 0, back is the value of the i-1th element of the cities list, otherwise back is -99999999. If i is less than n - 1, forward is the value of the i+1th element of the cities list. Otherwise, forward is 99999999. The ith element of prog_cities is 1 if the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the forward is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the back. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the forward.***
