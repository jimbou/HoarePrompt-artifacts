Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer that must be at least 2, prog_cities is a list of n-1 zeros, i is 0, back is -99999999, forward is 99999999**

The code snippet assigns specific values to the variables `back` and `forward`, setting `back` to a very low value (-99999999) and `forward` to a very high value (99999999). These assignments do not affect the values of `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, or `i`, which remain unchanged from their initial state.
