Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to travel from one city to the next, either by paying 1 coin to travel to the closest city or by paying the absolute difference between the two cities. The main program correctly uses these costs to calculate the prefix sums for both forward and backward directions, and then uses these prefix sums to answer the queries.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the query is from a city to itself, or when the query is from a city to a city that is not in the list.

The time complexity of the program is O(n + m), where n is the number of cities and m is the number of queries, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
