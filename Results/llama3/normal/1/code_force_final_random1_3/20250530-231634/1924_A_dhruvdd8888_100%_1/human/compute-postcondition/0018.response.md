Output State: **n, k, m are non-negative integers, s is a string of length m, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, win is an empty set, ans contains all characters in the string s that are part of the set us and are the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us, ps is the number of times a character in the string s is the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will contain the same values for the variables that are not affected by the loop, such as n, k, m, us, and stdin. The variable s will still be a string of length m. The set win will be empty because it is cleared every time its length becomes equal to k. The list ans will contain all characters in the string s that are part of the set us and are the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us. The variable ps will be the number of times a character in the string s is the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us.
