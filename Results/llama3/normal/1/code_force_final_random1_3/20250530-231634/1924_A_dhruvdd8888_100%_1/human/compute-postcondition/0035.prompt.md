You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, k, and m, where n, k, and m are non-negative integers. The second line contains a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: n, k, m are non-negative integers, s is a string of length m, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, win is an empty set, ans contains all characters in the string s that are part of the set us and are the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us, ps is the number of times a character in the string s is the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: *n, k, m are non-negative integers, s is a string of length m, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, win is an empty set, ans contains all characters in the string s that are part of the set us and are the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us, ps is the number of times a character in the string s is the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us, and ps is less than n
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The program returns a string that starts with all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, followed by the character `i` that is another element in the set `us` and is not in the set `win`, and then followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a's, where `n` is a non-negative integer, `len(ans)` is the number of characters in the string `ans`, and `ans` contains all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES'

Case_2: The program returns a string that starts with all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, followed by the character `i` that is another element in the set `us` and is not in the set `win`, and then followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a's, where `n` is a non-negative integer, `len(ans)` is the number of characters in the string `ans`, and `ans` contains all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
