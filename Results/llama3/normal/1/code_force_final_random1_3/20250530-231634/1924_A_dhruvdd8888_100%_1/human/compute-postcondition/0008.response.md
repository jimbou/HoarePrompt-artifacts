The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `s`. If `i` is not the last character in the string `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be the second character in the string `s`. 
State: **`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, and `i` is the second character in the string `s`.**
