Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, k, m are non-negative integers, s is a string of length m, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, win is an empty set, ans contains all characters in the string s that are part of the set us and are the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us, ps is the number of times a character in the string s is the kth character in a substring of s that consists only of characters in us, and ps is less than n, and the string 'NO' is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string of length `m`, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not empty, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `win` is an empty set, `ans` contains all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a character in the string `s` is the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, `ps` is less than `n`, `i` is an element in the set `us`, the string 'NO' is being printed, and `i` is in the set `win`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program returns a string that starts with all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, followed by the character `i` that is another element in the set `us` and is not in the set `win`, and then followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a's, where `n` is a non-negative integer, `len(ans)` is the number of characters in the string `ans`, and `ans` contains all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program returns a string that starts with all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, followed by the character `i` that is another element in the set `us` and is not in the set `win`, and then followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a's, where `n` is a non-negative integer, `len(ans)` is the number of characters in the string `ans`, and `ans` contains all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. If `i` is in the set `win`, the program does not return any value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
