Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer, m is a non-negative integer, s is a string of length m, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is an empty list, ps is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, and `i` is the first character in the string `s`. If `i` is a lowercase English alphabet that is part of the set `us` and the size of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` contains the first character in the string `s`, and `ps` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is the second character in the string `s`. If `i` is in `us` and the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` contains the second character in the string `s`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n, k, m are non-negative integers, s is a string with at least 3 characters, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the third character in the string s is in the set us and the size of the set win is equal to k, then ans contains the third character in the string s, ps is incremented by 1, and win is an empty set. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
