Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is the second character in the string `s`. If the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` contains the second character in the string `s`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
