Postcondition: **The program returns a string that starts with all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, followed by the character `i` that is another element in the set `us` and is not in the set `win`, and then followed by `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a's, where `n` is a non-negative integer, `len(ans)` is the number of characters in the string `ans`, and `ans` contains all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.**
