Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, and `win` is a set containing the second character in the string `s`**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the second character in the string `s`. The set `win` now contains the second character in the string `s`, which is `i`.
