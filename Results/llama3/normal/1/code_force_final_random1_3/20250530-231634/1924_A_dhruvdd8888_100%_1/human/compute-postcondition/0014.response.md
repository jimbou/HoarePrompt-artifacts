Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `win` is a set containing the third character in the string `s`.**

The code adds the third character in the string `s` to the set `win`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1.
