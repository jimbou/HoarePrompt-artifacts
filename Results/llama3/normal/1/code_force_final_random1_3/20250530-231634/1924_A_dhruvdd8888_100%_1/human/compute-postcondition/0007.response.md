Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, and `i` is the first character in the string `s`. If `i` is a lowercase English alphabet that is part of the set `us` and the size of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` contains the first character in the string `s`, and `ps` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
