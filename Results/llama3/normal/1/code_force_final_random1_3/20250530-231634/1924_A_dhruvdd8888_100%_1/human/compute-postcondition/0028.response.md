The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `us`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `us`. If `us` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `us` is not empty, `i` is an element in the set `us`, the string 'NO' is being printed, and `i` is in the set `win`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set `us` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is another element in the set `us` and `i` is not in the set `win` because `i` is already in the set `win` and it can not be added again.
State: **`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers, `s` is a string of length `m`, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that has at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `win` is a set that contains `i`, `ans` contains all characters in the string `s` that are part of the set `us` and are the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, `ps` is the number of times a character in the string `s` is the `k`th character in a substring of `s` that consists only of characters in `us`, `ps` is less than `n`, `i` is another element in the set `us` and `i` is not in the set `win`**
