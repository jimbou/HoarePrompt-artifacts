To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string of length `m`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` has at least 1 character and `i` is now the first character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is the first character in the string `s`**
