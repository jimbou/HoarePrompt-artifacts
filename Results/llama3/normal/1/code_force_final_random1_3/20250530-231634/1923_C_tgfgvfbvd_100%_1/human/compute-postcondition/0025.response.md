State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that must be greater than 1, l is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1, p is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of iterations plus 2, c is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of iterations plus 2, i is equal to its original value plus the difference between the bth element of c and the (a-1)th element of c, j is equal to the number of 1s in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, x is the last element in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to the difference between the bth element of p and the (a-1)th element of p. If the current value of b minus a plus 1 is greater than 1, and the current value of s minus (b - a + 1) is greater than or equal to the current value of i, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either (b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1) or (s - (b - a + 1) is less than i), and 'NO' is printed.**
