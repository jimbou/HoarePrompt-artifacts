Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list with two elements: the first element is 0 and the second element is equal to j+1 if `x` is 1 otherwise the second element is equal to j, `c` is a list with two elements: the first element is 0 and the second element is equal to j+1 if `x` is 1 otherwise the second element is equal to j, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the second element in the list `l`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is equal to `x` if `x` is 1 otherwise `i` is not modified, `j` is equal to 2 if `x` is 1 otherwise `j` is 1.***
