This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer list and queries on that list. For each query, it determines whether a certain condition is met based on the sum of elements and the count of ones in the specified range, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function consumes all input and resets variables for each test case, ultimately printing a 'YES' or 'NO' response for each query in every test case.
