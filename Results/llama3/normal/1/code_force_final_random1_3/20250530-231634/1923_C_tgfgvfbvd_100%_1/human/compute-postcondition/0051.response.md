To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for x in l:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `x` and `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` should be the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list with three elements: the first element is 0, the second element is equal to `j+1` if `x` is 1 otherwise the second element is equal to `j`, and the third element is equal to `i + x`, `c` is a list with three elements: the first element is 0, the second element is equal to `j+1` if `x` is 1 otherwise the second element is equal to `j`, and the third element is equal to `j`, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the third element in the list `l`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is equal to `x + x` if `x` is 1 otherwise `i` is equal to `x`, `j` is equal to 2 if `x` is 1 otherwise `j` is 1**
