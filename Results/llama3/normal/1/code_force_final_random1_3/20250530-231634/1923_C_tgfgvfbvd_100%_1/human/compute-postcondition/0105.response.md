The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list with len(l) + len(l) elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the first element of l, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in l, `c` is a list with len(l) + len(l) elements: the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if the first element of l is 1, otherwise it is 0, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in l, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the last element in the list l, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], `i` is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1], `j` is equal to the count of 1's in l, `_` is 1.**
