Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list with one element equal to 0, c is a list with one element equal to 0, i is 0, j is 0, stdin is empty, x is unchanged, a is an integer, b is an integer, and s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1].
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, p is a list with two elements: the first element is 0 and the second element is equal to x, c is a list with two elements: the first element is 0 and the second element is equal to j, stdin is empty, x is the first element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to x if x is 1 otherwise i is not modified, j is equal to 1 if x is 1 otherwise j is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list with three elements: the first element is 0, the second element is equal to j+1 if x is 1 otherwise the second element is equal to j, and the third element is equal to i + x, c is a list with three elements: the first element is 0, the second element is equal to j+1 if x is 1 otherwise the second element is equal to j, and the third element is equal to j, stdin is empty, x is the second element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to x + x if x is 1 otherwise i is equal to x, j is equal to 2 if x is 1 otherwise j is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list with four elements: the first element is 0, the second element is equal to j+1 if x is 1 otherwise the second element is equal to j, the third element is equal to i + x, and the fourth element is equal to i + x + x, c is a list with four elements: the first element is 0, the second element is equal to j+1 if x is 1 otherwise the second element is equal to j, the third element is equal to j, and the fourth element is equal to j, stdin is empty, x is the third element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to x + x + x if x is 1 otherwise i is equal to x + x, j is equal to 3 if x is 1 otherwise j is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
