Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is "good" based on the conditions provided. The program correctly implements the necessary logic to solve the problem.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `l`, and the queries themselves.
2. The program initializes the prefix sum array `p` and the count array `c` correctly. The prefix sum array `p` stores the cumulative sum of the elements in the array `l`, and the count array `c` stores the count of elements that are equal to 1.
3. The program correctly iterates over the queries and calculates the sum `s` of the subarray and the count `i` of elements that are equal to 1 in the subarray.
4. The program correctly applies the conditions to determine whether the subarray is "good". If the subarray has more than one element, and the sum `s` minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count `i` of elements that are equal to 1, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Based on the provided execution states, the program correctly handles the input and produces the expected output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
