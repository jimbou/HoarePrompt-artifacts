Output: **n is an integer, m is greater than 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list with len(l) + len(l) elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the first element of l, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in l, c is a list with len(l) + len(l) elements: the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if the first element of l is 1, otherwise it is 0, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in l, stdin is empty, x is the last element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1], j is equal to the count of 1's in l, _ is 0. The current value of b minus a plus 1 is greater than 1 and the current value of s minus the current value of b minus a plus 1 is greater than or equal to the current value of i, and 'YES' is printed**
