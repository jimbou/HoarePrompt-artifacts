Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, p is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of iterations plus 1, c is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of iterations plus 1, i is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the list, j is equal to the number of 1s in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is the last element in the list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, m is an integer that must be greater than 0, l is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, p is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of iterations plus 1, c is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of iterations plus 1, i is equal to its original value plus the difference between the bth element of c and the (a-1)th element of c, j is equal to the number of 1s in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is the last element in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to the difference between the bth element of p and the (a-1)th element of p. If the current value of b minus a plus 1 is greater than 1, and the current value of s minus (b - a + 1) is greater than or equal to the current value of i, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either (b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1) or (s - (b - a + 1) is less than i), and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program prints 'YES' if the difference between the bth element of p and the (a-1)th element of p minus the difference between the bth element of c and the (a-1)th element of c is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and 'NO' otherwise, while maintaining the initial conditions of n, m, l, p, c, i, j, stdin, x, a, b, and s.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program has printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions, `n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than the current iteration, `l` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is unchanged, `stdin` contains one less input, `x` is unchanged, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
