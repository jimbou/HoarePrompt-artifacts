Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list with len(l) + 1 elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in l, c is a list with len(l) + 1 elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in l, stdin is empty, x is the last element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1], j is equal to the count of 1's in l, i is 0, j is 0
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, p is a list with len(l) + 2 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the first element of l, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in l, c is a list with len(l) + 2 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if the first element of l is 1, otherwise it is 0, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in l, stdin is empty, x is the first element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] + x, j is equal to the count of 1's in l.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list with len(l) + 3 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the first element of l, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in l, and the last element is i, c is a list with len(l) + 3 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if the first element of l is 1, otherwise it is 0, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in l, and the last element is j, stdin is empty, x is the second element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] + x + x, if x is 1, then j is equal to the count of 1's in l plus 1, otherwise j is equal to the count of 1's in l.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list with len(l) + 4 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the first element of l, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in l, the second last element is i, and the last element is i + x, c is a list with len(l) + 4 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if the first element of l is 1, otherwise it is 0, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in l, the second last element is j if x is not 1, otherwise it is j + 1, and the last element is j if x is not 1, otherwise it is j + 1, stdin is empty, x is the third element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] + x + x + x, if x is 1, then j + 1 is equal to the count of 1's in l plus 1, otherwise j is equal to the count of 1's in l.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
