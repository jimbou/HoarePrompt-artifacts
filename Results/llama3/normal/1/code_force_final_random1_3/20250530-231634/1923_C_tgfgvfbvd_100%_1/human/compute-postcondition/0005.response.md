Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing a single element 0, `c` is a list containing a single element 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is the first element in the list. If `x` equals 1, then `j` is 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.***
