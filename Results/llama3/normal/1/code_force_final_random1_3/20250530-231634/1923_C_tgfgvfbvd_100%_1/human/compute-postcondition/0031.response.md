Postcondition: **The program prints 'YES' if the difference between the bth element of p and the (a-1)th element of p minus the difference between the bth element of c and the (a-1)th element of c is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and 'NO' otherwise, while maintaining the initial conditions of n, m, l, p, c, i, j, stdin, x, a, b, and s.**
