Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list with len(l) + 3 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the first element of l, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in l, and the last element is i, c is a list with len(l) + 3 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if the first element of l is 1, otherwise it is 0, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in l, and the last element is j, stdin is empty, x is the second element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] + x + x, if x is 1, then j is equal to the count of 1's in l plus 1, otherwise j is equal to the count of 1's in l.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by `x`, and this new value of `i` has been appended to the list `p`. The value of `j` has been appended to the list `c`. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged. The length of `p` and `c` has increased by 1.
