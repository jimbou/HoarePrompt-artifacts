Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is "good" based on certain conditions. The program uses prefix sums and counts of ones to efficiently process queries.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly initializes variables for each test case, including the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `l` itself, and the prefix sum array `p` and count of ones array `c`.
2.  It correctly calculates the prefix sums and counts of ones for the array `l`.
3.  For each query, it correctly calculates the sum of elements and the count of ones in the specified range using the prefix sum array and count of ones array.
4.  It correctly checks the conditions for a "good" subarray: the length of the subarray is greater than 1, and the sum of elements minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of ones in the subarray.
5.  Based on the conditions, it correctly prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its execution summary accurately reflects its behavior.

Correctness: **True**
