Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list with one element equal to 0, `c` is a list with one element equal to 0, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the first element in the list `l`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `s` is equal to `p[b]` - `p[a - 1]`. If `x` is 1, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are not modified.***
