The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, `input()` must be greater than 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `input()` must be greater than 0**
