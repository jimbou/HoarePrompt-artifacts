Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer that must be greater than 0, l is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, p is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of iterations plus 1, c is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of iterations plus 1, i is equal to its original value plus the difference between the bth element of c and the (a-1)th element of c, j is equal to the number of 1s in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is the last element in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to the difference between the bth element of p and the (a-1)th element of p. Either (b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1) or (s - (b - a + 1) is less than i), and 'NO' is printed**
