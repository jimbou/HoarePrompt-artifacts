Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list with len(l) + 1 elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list with len(l) + 1 elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in `l`, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the first element in the list `l`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is equal to the count of 1's in `l`. If `x` is 1, then `i` is 1. Otherwise, `i` remains 0.**
