Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list with len(l) + 4 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the first element of l, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in l, the second last element is i, and the last element is i + x, c is a list with len(l) + 4 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if the first element of l is 1, otherwise it is 0, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in l, the second last element is j if x is not 1, otherwise it is j + 1, and the last element is j if x is not 1, otherwise it is j + 1, stdin is empty, x is the third element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] + x + x + x, if x is 1, then j + 1 is equal to the count of 1's in l plus 1, otherwise j is equal to the count of 1's in l.**

The code modifies the lists `p` and `c` by appending new elements to them. The value of `i` is incremented by `x` and then appended to `p`. The value of `j` is appended to `c`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
