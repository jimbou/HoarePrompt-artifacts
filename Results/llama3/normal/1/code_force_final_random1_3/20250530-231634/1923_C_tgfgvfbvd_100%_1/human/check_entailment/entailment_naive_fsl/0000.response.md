Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". It maintains two prefix arrays, `p` and `c`, where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the array `l`, and `c[i]` is the count of 1's in the first `i` elements of the array `l`. 

For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `s` and the count of 1's `i` in the subarray. It then checks if the subarray is good by verifying that the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the subarray. This is because the sum of the subarray must be equal to the sum of the new array `b`, and since all elements in `b` must be greater than 0, the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray must be greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the subarray.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the subarray has only one element, when the subarray has no 1's, and when the subarray has all 1's. It also handles the case when the subarray is the entire array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good" and handles all edge cases correctly.
