Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of `i` before the increment, and the value of `i` after the increment, `c` is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of `j` before the increment, and the value of `j` after the increment, `i` is equal to its original value plus the second element in the list plus the third element in the list, `j` is 3 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise `j` is increased by 2 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise `j` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is the third element in the list***
