Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing a single element 0, `c` is a list containing a single element 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `x` is the first element in the list and equals 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still has at least one element, and `x` is still equal to the first element in the list, which is 1. The input in stdin is still multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
