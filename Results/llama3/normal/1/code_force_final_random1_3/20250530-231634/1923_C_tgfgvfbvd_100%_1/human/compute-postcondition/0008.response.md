Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of `i` after the increment, `c` is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of `j`, `i` is equal to its original value plus the second element in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `j` is 2 if the second element in the list equals 1, otherwise `j` is increased by 1, `x` is the second element in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. If the second element in the list `l` is 1, then `j` is now 2. Otherwise, `j` has been increased by 1 from its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
