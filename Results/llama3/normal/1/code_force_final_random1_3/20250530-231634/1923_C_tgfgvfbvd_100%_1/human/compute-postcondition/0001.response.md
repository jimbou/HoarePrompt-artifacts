Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing a single element 0, c is a list containing a single element 0, i is 0, j is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**.

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`. The next two lines initialize two lists, `p` and `c`, each containing a single element 0. Finally, it initializes two variables, `i` and `j`, to 0. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that two inputs have been consumed.
