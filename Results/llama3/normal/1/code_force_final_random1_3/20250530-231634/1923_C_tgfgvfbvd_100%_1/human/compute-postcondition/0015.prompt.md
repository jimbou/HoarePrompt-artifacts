Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing a single element 0, c is a list containing a single element 0, i is 0, j is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of i after the increment, c is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of j, i is equal to its original value plus x, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is the first element in the list. If x equals 1, then j is 1. Otherwise, j remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of i before the increment, and the value of i after the increment, c is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of j, and the value of j, i is equal to its original value plus the second element in the list plus x, j is 2 if x is 1, otherwise j is increased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is the second element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing four elements: 0, the value of i before the increment, the value of i after the increment, and the value of i after the second increment, c is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of j before the increment, and the value of j after the increment, i is equal to its original value plus the second element in the list plus the third element in the list plus x, j is 3 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise j is increased by 2 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise j is increased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, x is the third element in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
