To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `l`. The loop will execute if `l` has at least one element. Since `x` is the last element in the list `l`, for the loop to start, `x` should be the first element in the list `l`. Also, since `i` and `j` are related to the cumulative count and sum of elements in `l`, their values should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list with len(l) + 1 elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list with len(l) + 1 elements: the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in `l`, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the first element in the list `l`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is equal to the count of 1's in `l`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
