Postcondition: ***The program has printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions, `n` is unchanged, `m` is greater than the current iteration, `l` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is unchanged, `stdin` contains one less input, `x` is unchanged, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
