Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three inputs: first an integer t, then two integers n and q, and then a list of n integers. The list of integers is followed by q queries, each query consisting of two integers l and r. All integers are non-negative and 1 <= l <= r <= n.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [0]
        
        c = [0]
        
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has executed for all the test cases in the input, and the program has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each query in each test case based on the conditions. The input has been fully consumed, and the variables n, m, l, p, c, i, j, x, a, b, and s have been reset for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer list and queries on that list. For each query, it determines whether a certain condition is met based on the sum of elements and the count of ones in the specified range, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function consumes all input and resets variables for each test case, ultimately printing a 'YES' or 'NO' response for each query in every test case.
