Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list with len(l) + 2 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the first element of l, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of the elements in l, `c` is a list with len(l) + 2 elements: the first element is 0, the second element is 1 if the first element of l is 1, otherwise it is 0, and the rest of the elements are the cumulative count of 1's in l, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the second element in the list `l`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1] + x`, `j` is equal to the count of 1's in `l` plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
