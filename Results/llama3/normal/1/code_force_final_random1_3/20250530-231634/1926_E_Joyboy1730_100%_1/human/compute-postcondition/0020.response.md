Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 2 integers, tot is a, pow is 2, a is the second element of L which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, then the program prints 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1).***
