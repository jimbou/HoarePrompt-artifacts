Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t - 1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is an empty list**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first pair of integers from stdin to `n` and `k`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, and each pair of integers is read from stdin, the number of pairs remaining in stdin is reduced by 1. The second line initializes an empty list `L`. No other variables are affected.
