Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers m equal to the number of times the loop executed, all m are equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus the last element of L, then the expression pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in L.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged, still between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.
- The input `stdin` still contains 0 pairs of integers `n` and `k`.
- The value of `n` remains 0.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
- The list `L` contains a number of integers `m` equal to the number of times the loop executed. All `m` are equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `tot` is now the sum of all elements in `L`.
- The value of `pow` is now 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed.
- If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the last element of `L`, then the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is printed, where `pow` is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `tot` is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in `L`.
