Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the process described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the position `k` of the card to be found.

3. It then calculates the number of cards in each group (odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 and rounding up. The results are stored in the list `L`.

4. It then iterates over the list `L` and checks if the current group contains the `k`-th card. If it does, it calculates the value of the `k`-th card by multiplying the power of 2 (which represents the current group) by the `k`-th odd number in the group.

5. The program correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than the number of cards in the current group by moving on to the next group.

6. The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is a power of 2, in which case the last group will contain only one card.

7. Finally, the program prints the value of the `k`-th card.

Correctness: **True**
