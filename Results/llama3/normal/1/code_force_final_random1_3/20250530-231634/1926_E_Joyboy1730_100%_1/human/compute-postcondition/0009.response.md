Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers m equal to the number of times the loop executed, all m are equal to (n + 1) // 2**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains unchanged, `stdin` is empty, `n` is 0, `k` is still between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `L` is a list containing a number of integers `m` equal to the number of times the loop executed, all of which are equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
