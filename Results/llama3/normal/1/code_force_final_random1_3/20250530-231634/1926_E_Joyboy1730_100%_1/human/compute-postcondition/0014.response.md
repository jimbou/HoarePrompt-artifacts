Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `stdin` contains 0 pairs of integers `n` and `k`, `n` is an integer equal to 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `L` is a list containing at least 1 integer `m` equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is the first element of `L`. The current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, and this is printed: `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` where `pow` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `tot` is 0**
