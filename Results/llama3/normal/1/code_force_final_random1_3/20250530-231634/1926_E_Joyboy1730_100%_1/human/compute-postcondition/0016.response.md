Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 1 integer m equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is a, pow is 2, a is the first element of L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, then the value of pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where pow is 2, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and tot is a.**

The code modifies the values of `tot` and `pow`. The first line increments `tot` by the value of `a`, making `tot` equal to `a`. The second line multiplies `pow` by 2, making `pow` equal to 2. The condition for printing the value of `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is still valid, but now `tot` is `a` and `pow` is 2.
