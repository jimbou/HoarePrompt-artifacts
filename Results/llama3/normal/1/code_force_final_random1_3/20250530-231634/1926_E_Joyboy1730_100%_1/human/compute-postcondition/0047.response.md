Postcondition: **t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 2 elements, where the first element is 0 and the second element is x, a is x, tot is 0, pow is 2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then 2 * (2 * (k - 0) - 1) = 4k - 2 is printed.**
