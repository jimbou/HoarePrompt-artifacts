The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is equal to 4, `k` is equal to the integer value of the second input, and `tot` is equal to the sum of the first four elements in the list `L`. 

Since the exact value of `k` and the elements in the list `L` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression.

Output: **4 * (2 * (k - sum of the first four elements in the list L) - 1) (where k is the integer value of the second input and sum of the first four elements in the list L is the sum of the first four elements in the list L)**
