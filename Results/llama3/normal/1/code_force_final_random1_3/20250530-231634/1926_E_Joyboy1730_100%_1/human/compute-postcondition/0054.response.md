Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is equal to the number of times the loop executed, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers equal to the number of times the loop executed, all integers in L are equal to (n + 1) // 2, a is the last element in L, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is equal to 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of 'n' is equal to the number of times the loop executed, the value of 'a' is the last element in the list 'L', the value of 'tot' is the sum of all elements in 'L', and the value of 'pow' is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed. The values of 't' and 'k' remain unchanged.
