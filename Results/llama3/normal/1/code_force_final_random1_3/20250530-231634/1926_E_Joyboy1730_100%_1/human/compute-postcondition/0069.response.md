Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is 0, `k` is equal to the integer value of the second input, `L` is a list containing at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, then the result of the expression `2 * k - 1` is being printed.***
