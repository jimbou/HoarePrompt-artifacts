Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 2 integers, tot is an integer equal to its original value plus a, pow is 4, a is the second element of L which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, then the program printed 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1).**

In this output state, the value of `tot` has been updated to be the sum of its original value and `a`, and the value of `pow` has been updated to be 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The program may have printed a value if the conditions `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` were met.
