Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It first calculates the number of cards in each group (odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) and stores them in the list L. Then, it iterates over the list L and checks if the k-th card falls within the current group. If it does, it calculates the value of the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly calculates the number of cards in each group, and it correctly determines which group the k-th card belongs to. The formula used to calculate the value of the k-th card is also correct.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
