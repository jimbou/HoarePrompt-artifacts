Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing one integer m equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed
Code of the loop:
while n:
    m = (n + 1) // 2
    n -= m
    L.append(m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer equal to (n - ((n + 1) // 2)), k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing two integers, the first integer is (n + 1) // 2 and the second integer is (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to 2 * ((n + 1) // 2), pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing three integers, the first integer is (n + 1) // 2, the second integer is (n + 1) // 2, and the third integer is (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to 2 * ((n + 1) // 2), pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, m is (n + 1) // 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing four integers, the first three integers are (n + 1) // 2 and the fourth integer is (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to 2 * ((n + 1) // 2), pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, m is (n + 1) // 2


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
