The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is 2, `k` is the integer value of the second input, and `tot` is the sum of the first two elements in the list `L`. 

Since the exact values of the elements in the list `L` and the second input are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression.

Output: **2 * (2 * (k - (sum of the first two elements in the list L)) - 1) (where k is the integer value of the second input)**
