Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers m equal to the number of times the loop executed, all m are equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is 0, pow is 1
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 1 integer m equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is a, pow is 2, a is the first element of L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, then the value of pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where pow is 2, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and tot is a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 2 integers, tot is an integer equal to its original value plus a, pow is 4, a is the second element of L which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, then the program printed 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 3 integers, tot is an integer equal to its original value plus a, pow is 8, a is the third element of L which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the expression 4 * (2 * (k - (tot)) - 1) is printed, where k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and tot is an integer equal to its original value plus a, and a is the third element of L which is an integer greater than or equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
