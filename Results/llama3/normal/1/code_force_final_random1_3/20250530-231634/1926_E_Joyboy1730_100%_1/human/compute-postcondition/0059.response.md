The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus (n + 1) // 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus (n + 1) // 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing the integer (n + 1) // 2, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined**
