The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer equal to (n - m), m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to (n - m), m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, L is a list containing two integers m and m which is equal to (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive**
