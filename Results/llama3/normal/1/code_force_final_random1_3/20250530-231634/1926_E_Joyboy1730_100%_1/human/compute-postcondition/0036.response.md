Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers equal to the number of times the loop executed, all integers in L are equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t remains an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n becomes 0, k remains an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L becomes a list containing a number of integers equal to the number of times the loop executed, all integers in L are equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in L, and pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed.
