According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list L. If the list L has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, tot is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list L must have at least 1 element and a is the first element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is 0, `k` is equal to the integer value of the second input, `L` is a list containing at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1**
