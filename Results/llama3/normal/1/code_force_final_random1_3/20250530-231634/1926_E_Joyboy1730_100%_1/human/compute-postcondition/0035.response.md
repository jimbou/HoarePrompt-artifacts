Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing four integers, the first three integers are (n + 1) // 2 and the fourth integer is (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to 2 * ((n + 1) // 2), pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, m is (n + 1) // 2**

The code modifies the values of `n`, `L`, and `m`. The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `m`, which is the same as the initial value of `m`. The second line subtracts the value of `m` from `n`, effectively dividing `n` by 2 and rounding down. The third line appends the value of `m` to the list `L`, adding a fourth element to the list. The values of `t`, `k`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.
