Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers m equal to the number of times the loop executed, all m are equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus the last element of L, then the expression pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in L.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is equal to the number of times the loop executed, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers equal to the number of times the loop executed, all integers in L are equal to (n + 1) // 2, a is the last element in L, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is equal to 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing the integer (n + 1) // 2, a is the last element in the list, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in the list. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and the last element in the list, then the result of the expression 2 to the power of the number of elements in the list minus 1 times 2 * (k - tot) - 1 is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
