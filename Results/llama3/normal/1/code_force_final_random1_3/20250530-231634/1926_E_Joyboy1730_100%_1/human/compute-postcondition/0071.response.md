To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `a` and `L`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `L` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `L` has at least 1 element, and `a` is the first element in the list. For the loop to execute again, `L` must have at least 2 elements, and `a` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is 0, `k` is equal to the integer value of the second input, `L` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `tot` is equal to the sum of the first two elements in the list, `pow` is 2**
