The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is 4, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `tot` is `x`, where `x` is the second element of the list `L`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression.

Output: **4 * (2 * (k - x) - 1) (where k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive and x is the second element of the list L)**
