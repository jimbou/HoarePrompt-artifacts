Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers m equal to the number of times the loop executed, all m are equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is 0, pow is 1**

The code initializes two new variables, `tot` and `pow`, and assigns them the values 0 and 1, respectively. The initial state remains unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `stdin` containing 0 pairs of integers `n` and `k`, `n` being an integer equal to 0, `k` being an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `L` being a list containing a number of integers `m` equal to the number of times the loop executed, all `m` being equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
