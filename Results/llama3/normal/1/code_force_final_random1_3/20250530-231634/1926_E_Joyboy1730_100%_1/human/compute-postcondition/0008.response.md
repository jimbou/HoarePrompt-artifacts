Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t - 3 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to (n - m), m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, L is a list containing three integers m, m and m which is equal to (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of pairs of integers `n` and `k` in stdin decreases by one due to the first line of the code, which reads a pair of integers from stdin. The value of `n` is updated to be equal to `(n - m)`, where `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. The list `L` now contains three integers, all equal to `m`, which is also equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
