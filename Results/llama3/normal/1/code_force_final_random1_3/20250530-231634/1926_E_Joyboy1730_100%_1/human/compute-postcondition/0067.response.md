The code prints the product of `pow` and the result of the expression `2 * (k - tot) - 1`. 

Here, `pow` is 1, `k` is the integer value of the second input, and `tot` is 0.

Since `tot` is 0, the expression `2 * (k - tot) - 1` simplifies to `2 * k - 1`. 

Therefore, the code prints the product of 1 and `2 * k - 1`, which is `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the integer value of the second input)**
