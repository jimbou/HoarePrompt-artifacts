The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `tot` is 0.

Since `tot` is 0, the expression `2 * (k - tot)` simplifies to `2 * k`. 

The expression `2 * k - 1` is then multiplied by `pow`, which is 1.

So, the final result is `2 * k - 1`.

Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the final result will be an odd integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9 - 1 inclusive.

Output: **an odd integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9 - 1 inclusive**
