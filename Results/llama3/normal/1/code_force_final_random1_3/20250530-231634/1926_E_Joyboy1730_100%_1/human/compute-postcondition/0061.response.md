The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is 0, so for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is greater than 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing two identical elements: the original value of n divided by 2, rounded down, m is half of the original value of n, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined**
