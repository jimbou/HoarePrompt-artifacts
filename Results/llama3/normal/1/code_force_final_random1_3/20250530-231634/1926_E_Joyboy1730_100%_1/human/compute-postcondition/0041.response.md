Output: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `L` is a list containing at least 1 element, which is 0, `a` is 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1. The current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, and this is printed: the product of `pow` and the difference between twice the difference of `k` and `tot` and 1, which is equal to `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`**
