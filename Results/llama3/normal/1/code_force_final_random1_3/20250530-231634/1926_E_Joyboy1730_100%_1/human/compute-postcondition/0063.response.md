Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing the integer (n + 1) // 2, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 't' remains unchanged, 'n' becomes 0, 'k' remains unchanged, 'L' contains the integer (n + 1) // 2, and 'a', 'tot', and 'pow' remain undefined.
