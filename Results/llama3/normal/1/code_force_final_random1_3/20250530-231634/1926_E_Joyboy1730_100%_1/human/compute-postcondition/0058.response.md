Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus (n + 1) // 2, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing the integer (n + 1) // 2, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been modified by subtracting `(n + 1) // 2` from its original value. The list `L` now contains the integer `(n + 1) // 2`, which was appended in the second line of the code. All other variables remain unchanged.
