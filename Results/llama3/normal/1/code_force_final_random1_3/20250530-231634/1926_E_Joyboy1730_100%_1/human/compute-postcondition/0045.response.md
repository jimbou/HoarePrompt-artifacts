To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement step by step, using the given initial state.

The expression to be printed is: `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`

1. **pow**: Given that `pow` is 2.
2. **k**: `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The exact value of `k` is not specified, so we'll keep it as `k`.
3. **tot**: `tot` is 0.

Now, let's substitute these values into the expression:

`2 * (2 * (k - 0) - 1)`

Simplifying the expression:

`2 * (2 * k - 1)`

`4 * k - 2`

So, the expression simplifies to `4 * k - 2`, where `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

Output: **4k - 2 (where k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive)**
