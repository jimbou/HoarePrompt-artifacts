Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is an integer equal to (n - m), m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, L is a list containing two integers m and m which is equal to (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be equal to `n - m`, where `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `m` is also updated to be equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. The list `L` now contains two integers, both equal to `m`, which is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
