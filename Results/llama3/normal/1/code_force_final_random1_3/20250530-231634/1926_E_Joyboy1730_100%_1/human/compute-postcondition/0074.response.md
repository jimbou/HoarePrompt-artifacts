Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `n` is 0, `k` is equal to the integer value of the second input, `L` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `tot` is equal to the sum of the first two elements in the list, `pow` is 2. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed.***
