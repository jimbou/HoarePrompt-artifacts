The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer equal to (n - ((n + 1) // 2)). So for the loop to be executed one more time n must not be equal to 0 and must be equal to (n - ((n + 1) // 2)).
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer not equal to 0 and equal to (n - ((n + 1) // 2)), k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing two integers, the first integer is (n + 1) // 2 and the second integer is (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to 2 * ((n + 1) // 2), pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed**
