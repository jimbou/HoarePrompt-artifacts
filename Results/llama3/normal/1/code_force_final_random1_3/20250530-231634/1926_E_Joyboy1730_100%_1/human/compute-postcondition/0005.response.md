The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer equal to n - m. So for the loop to be executed one more time n - m must not be equal to 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing one integer m which is equal to (n + 1) // 2, m is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, n is an integer equal to n - m and n - m must not be equal to 0**
