Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is equal to the integer value of the first input, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is an empty list, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the first and second inputs to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line initializes an empty list `L`. 

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `a`, `tot`, and `pow` are updated as follows:

*   `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
*   `n` is updated to the integer value of the first input.
*   `k` is updated to the integer value of the second input.
*   `L` is initialized as an empty list.
*   `a` becomes undefined since `L` is empty and does not have a last element.
*   `tot` becomes undefined since the sum of elements in `L` is undefined for an empty list.
*   `pow` becomes undefined since it is not updated by the code and its previous value is no longer valid.
