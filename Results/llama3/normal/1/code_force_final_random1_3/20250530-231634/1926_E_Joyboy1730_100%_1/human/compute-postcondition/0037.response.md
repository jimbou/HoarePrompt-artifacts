Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers equal to the number of times the loop executed, all integers in L are equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is 0, pow is 1**

The code initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `L` remains unchanged as the code does not modify these variables. The value of `tot` is reset to 0, and `pow` is set to 1.
