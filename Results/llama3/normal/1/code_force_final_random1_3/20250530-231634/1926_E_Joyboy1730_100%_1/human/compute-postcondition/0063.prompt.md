Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is equal to the integer value of the first input, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is an empty list, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined
Code of the loop:
while n:
    m = (n + 1) // 2
    n -= m
    L.append(m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus (n + 1) // 2, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing the integer (n + 1) // 2, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing two identical elements: the original value of n divided by 2, rounded down, m is half of the original value of n, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is greater than 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing three elements: the original value of n divided by 2, rounded down, the original value of n divided by 2, rounded down, and half of the original value of n, m is half of the original value of n, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
