The function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of integers n and k. For each pair, it calculates a value based on the binary representation of n and prints the result if k falls within a certain range. The function iterates through all test cases, performing the calculation and printing results as applicable, and concludes with all input variables reset to their initial state.
