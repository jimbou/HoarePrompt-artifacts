The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is given as 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and `tot` is an integer equal to `a` which is the second element of list `L` and is greater than or equal to 0.

Since the exact values of `k` and `tot` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the given expression.

Output: **2 * (2 * (k - a) - 1) (where k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive and a is the second element of list L)**
