Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing the integer (n + 1) // 2, a is undefined, tot is 0, pow is 1
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing at least 1 element, a is the first element in the list, tot is equal to a, pow is 2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and a, then the result of the expression 2 * k - 1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, tot is equal to the sum of the first three elements in the list, pow is 4. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, then 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing at least 3 elements, a is the third element in the list, tot is equal to the sum of the first four elements in the list plus a, pow is 8. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the expression 4 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
