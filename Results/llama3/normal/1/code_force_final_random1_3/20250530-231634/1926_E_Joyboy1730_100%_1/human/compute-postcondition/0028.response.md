The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers n and k, n is an integer equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers m equal to the number of times the loop executed, all m are equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed**
