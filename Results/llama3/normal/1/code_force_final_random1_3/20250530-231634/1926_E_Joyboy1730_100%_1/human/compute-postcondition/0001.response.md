According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we can adjust the state to be more specific.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
