Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing a number of integers equal to the number of times the loop executed, all integers in L are equal to (n + 1) // 2, tot is 0, pow is 1
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 1 element, which is 0, a is 0, tot is 0, pow is 2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and a, the product of pow and the difference between twice the difference of k and tot and 1, which is equal to pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1), is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 2 elements, where the first element is 0 and the second element is x, a is x, tot is x, pow is 4. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then 4k - 2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing at least 3 elements, where the first element is 0, the second element is x, and the third element is y, a is y, tot is x + y, pow is 8. If x + y is less than k and k is less than or equal to x + y + y, the result of the expression 4 * (2 * (k - x) - 1) is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
