The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be not equal to 0.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, L is a list containing three integers, the first integer is (n + 1) // 2, the second integer is (n + 1) // 2, and the third integer is (n + 1) // 2, tot is an integer equal to 2 * ((n + 1) // 2), pow is 2 to the power of the number of times the loop executed, m is (n + 1) // 2**
