The code snippet provided modifies the values of `n` and `L`, and introduces a new variable `m`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `m`. Since `n` is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus `(n + 1) // 2`, we can deduce that `n` was originally an odd number (because subtracting `(n + 1) // 2` from it would result in a non-zero integer). Therefore, `(n + 1) // 2` is equal to the original value of `n` divided by 2, rounded down. So, `m` becomes half of the original value of `n`.
*   The second line decrements `n` by the value of `m`. Since `m` is half of the original value of `n`, this effectively sets `n` to 0.
*   The third line appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Since `L` initially contains the integer `(n + 1) // 2`, which is equal to half of the original value of `n`, appending `m` (which is also half of the original value of `n`) results in `L` containing two identical elements: the original value of `n` divided by 2, rounded down.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, n is 0, k is equal to the integer value of the second input, L is a list containing two identical elements: the original value of n divided by 2, rounded down, m is half of the original value of n, a is undefined, tot is undefined, pow is undefined**
