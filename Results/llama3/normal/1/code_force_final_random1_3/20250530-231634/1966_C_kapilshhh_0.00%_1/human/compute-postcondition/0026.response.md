Output State: **tc is a positive integer and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-6 test cases, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True, n is the length of arr minus 1, 'Alice' is printed twice, i is n**

In this output state, the value of tc remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1 due to the execution of the first line, which reads an integer from stdin. The list arr is recreated with unique positive integers in descending order, followed by an extra 0, as a result of the second and third lines. The value of dp is set to True, regardless of its previous value. The value of n is updated to be the length of the new arr minus 1. The value of i remains equal to n. The variable 'Alice' is still printed twice, as this is not affected by the code.
