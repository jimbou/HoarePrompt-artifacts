Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `arr` is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` or `dp` is False, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed three times, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `tc` has decreased by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `tc` is now a positive integer greater than 0, and 'Alice' has been printed three times.
