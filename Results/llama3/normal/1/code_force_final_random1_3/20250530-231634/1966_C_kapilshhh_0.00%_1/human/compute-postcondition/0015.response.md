To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 2, since the range starts from 1. 

State: **`tc` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `arr` is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with at least two elements and an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is True, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed, `i` is 1**
