To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `arr` has at least two elements and an extra 0 at the end. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The length of `arr` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least 4 elements (including the extra 0 at the end) for the loop to execute again.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `arr` is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with at least three elements and an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[2] - (arr[3] if 3 < n else 0) > 1` or False otherwise, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed, `i` is 3**
