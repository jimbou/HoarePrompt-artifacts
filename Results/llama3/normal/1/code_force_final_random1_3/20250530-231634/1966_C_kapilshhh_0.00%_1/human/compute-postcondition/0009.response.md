Output State: **tc is a positive integer, stdin contains t-2 test cases, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True if the difference between any two consecutive elements in arr is greater than 1, otherwise it's False, i is n.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same initial state for `tc` and `stdin`, but `dp` will be `True` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, otherwise it will be `False`. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the number of elements in `arr` before the extra 0 at the end.
