Output State: **tc is a positive integer and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True if arr[n-1] - (arr[n] if n < n else 0) > 1 or False otherwise, n is the length of arr minus 1, 'Alice' is printed twice, i is n**.

The code decrements the value of `tc` by 1, so `tc` is now a positive integer and is greater than 0. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases, but since `tc` has been decremented, the number of test cases is now t-5. The values of `arr`, `dp`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The string 'Alice' is still printed twice.
