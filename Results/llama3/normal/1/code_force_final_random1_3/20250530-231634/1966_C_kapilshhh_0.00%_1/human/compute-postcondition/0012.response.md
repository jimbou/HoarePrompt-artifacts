Output State: **tc is a positive integer and is decreased by 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True if the difference between any two consecutive elements in arr is greater than 1, otherwise it's False, i is n, and 'Alice' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `tc` has been decreased by 1, and the number of test cases in stdin has also decreased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
