Output State: **tc is a positive integer and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True if arr[n-1] - (arr[n] if n < n else 0) > 1 or False otherwise, n is the length of arr minus 1, 'Alice' is printed, i is n**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `tc` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `stdin` still contains `t-4` test cases, `arr` remains a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the second last element and the last element of `arr` is greater than 1 or False otherwise, `n` remains the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed, and `i` is equal to `n`.
