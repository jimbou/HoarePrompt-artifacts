The code `tc = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. n is a positive integer and each integer in the list is a positive integer. So, `tc` is assigned the value of the first integer of the first test case in the stdin. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. n is a positive integer and each integer in the list is a positive integer.

Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. n is a positive integer and each integer in the list is a positive integer.**
