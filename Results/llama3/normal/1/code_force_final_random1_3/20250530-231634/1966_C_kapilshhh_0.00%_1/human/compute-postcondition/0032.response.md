Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `arr` is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with at least 3 elements and an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` or `dp` is False, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed twice, `i` is at least 3, and `dp` is updated to be True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` or False if `dp` was previously True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between the current element and the next element in the array `arr`. If the difference is greater than 1, `dp` becomes True; otherwise, it becomes False if it was previously True. The other variables remain unchanged.
