To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `tc > 0`. The only variable in the loop head is `tc`.

Given that `tc` is a positive integer, this already guarantees that `tc > 0`, because any positive integer is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `tc` for the loop to execute the first time.

The state of `stdin` (containing `t-1` test cases) and the details about each test case (containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers) do not affect the condition of the `while` loop directly. The loop's execution depends solely on the value of `tc`.

Since `tc` being a positive integer is sufficient for the loop to execute at least once, no changes to the program state are required.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. n is a positive integer and each integer in the list is a positive integer.**
