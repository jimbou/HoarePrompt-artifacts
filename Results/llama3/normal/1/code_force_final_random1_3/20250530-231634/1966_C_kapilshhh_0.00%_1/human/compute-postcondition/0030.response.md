Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `arr` is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with at least 3 elements and an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` or `dp` is False, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed twice, `i` is at least 2**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` or the negation of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
