To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 1, and `arr` has at least 2 elements and an extra 0 at the end.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `arr` must have at least one more element. Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`tc` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `arr` is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with at least 3 elements and an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is either True or False depending on the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` (or 0 if `i` is equal to `n`), `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed twice, `i` is at least 2**
