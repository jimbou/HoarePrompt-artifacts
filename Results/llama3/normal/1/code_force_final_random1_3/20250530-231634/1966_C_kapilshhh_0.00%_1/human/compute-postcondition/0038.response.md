Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by a list of n positive integers. It then processes each test case by removing duplicates from the list, sorting the remaining integers in descending order, and appending a 0 to the end. The function checks if the difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list is greater than 1 and prints 'Alice' if this condition is met, otherwise it prints 'Alice' as well. The function repeats this process for all test cases and does not return any value.**
