To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1). 

Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which is `len(arr) - 1`. For the loop to execute, `i` should be less than `len(arr) - 1`, so `i` should be at least 1. Also, `arr` should have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `arr` is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with at least 2 elements and an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is True, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed twice, `i` is at least 1**
