The only variable in the loop head is variable tc, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable tc. If tc is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, tc is a positive integer and is greater than 0, so for the loop to be executed one more time tc must be greater than 1.
State: **tc is a positive integer and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True if arr[n-1] - (arr[n] if n < n else 0) > 1 or False otherwise, n is the length of arr minus 1, 'Alice' is printed twice, i is n**
