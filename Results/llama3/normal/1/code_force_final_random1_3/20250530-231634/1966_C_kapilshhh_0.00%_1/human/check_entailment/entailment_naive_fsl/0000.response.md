Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is the player who can remove the last stone from the pile. The program's logic is flawed because it only checks if the difference between the current pile and the next pile is greater than 1, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the winner.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "Alice", but the correct output is "Bob". The correct sequence of moves is:

Alice: remove 1 stone from each pile, resulting in [0, 1, 2]
Bob: remove 1 stone from each pile, resulting in [0, 0, 1]
Alice: remove 1 stone from the last pile, resulting in [0, 0, 0]

Since Bob made the last move, he wins the game.

The program's logic is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual sequence of moves that the players can make. It only checks the differences between the piles, which is not enough to determine the winner.
