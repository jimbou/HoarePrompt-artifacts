Output State: **tc is a positive integer, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. n is a positive integer and each integer in the list is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains t-1 test cases, each containing two inputs, this line consumes the first input of the current test case, leaving t-2 test cases in stdin. The second line assigns a list of unique positive integers in descending order (with an extra 0 at the end) to `arr`. The third line assigns `True` to `dp`. The fourth line updates the value of `n` to be the length of `arr` minus 1, which is the number of unique positive integers in the list (excluding the extra 0).
