Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. n is a positive integer and each integer in the list is a positive integer.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: tc is a positive integer and is decreased by 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True if the difference between any two consecutive elements in arr is greater than 1, otherwise it's False, i is n, and 'Alice' is printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: tc is a positive integer and is greater than 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True if arr[n-1] - (arr[n] if n < n else 0) > 1 or False otherwise, n is the length of arr minus 1, 'Alice' is printed twice, i is n
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tc` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `arr` is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` or `dp` is False, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed three times, and `i` is equal to `n`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
