Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `arr` is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with at least 2 elements and an extra 0 at the end, `dp` is either True or False depending on the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` (or 0 if `i` is equal to `n`), `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, 'Alice' is printed twice, `i` is at least 1**

In this output state, the value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` (or 0 if `i` is equal to `n`). If the difference is greater than 1, `dp` becomes True. Otherwise, `dp` becomes False. The other variables remain unchanged.
