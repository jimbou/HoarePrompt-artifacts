Output State: **tc is a positive integer and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, arr is a list of unique positive integers in descending order with an extra 0 at the end, dp is True, n is the length of arr minus 1, and 'Alice' is printed**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `tc` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, now containing t-4 test cases. The list `arr` is updated to contain unique positive integers in descending order, with an extra 0 at the end. The variable `dp` is set to True. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of `arr` minus 1. Finally, the string 'Alice' is printed.
