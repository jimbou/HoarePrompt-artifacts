To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ls`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `ls` has at least 2 elements (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(ls)`). 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be 1 (the starting value of the range), and `ls` should have at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
