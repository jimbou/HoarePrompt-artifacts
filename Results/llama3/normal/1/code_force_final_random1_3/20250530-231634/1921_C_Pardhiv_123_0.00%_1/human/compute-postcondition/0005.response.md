The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and ls, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ls`. If `i` is less than `len(ls)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `ls` is a list of at least 2 positive integers in ascending order. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `i` is 2 and `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers in ascending order.
State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[1] - ls[0])` and `b`**
