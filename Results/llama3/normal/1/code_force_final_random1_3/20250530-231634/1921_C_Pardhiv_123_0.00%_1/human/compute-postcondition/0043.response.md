Output State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1, n is an integer, f is an integer decreased by the minimum of a * (y - x) and b and also decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b and also decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b and also decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b and so on until i is equal to n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, ls is a list of n integers, i is n - 1, x is the first element of ls, y is the second element of ls.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1, `n` remains an integer, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (y - x)` and `b` for each pair of consecutive elements in `ls`, `a` and `b` remain integers, `ls` remains a list of `n` integers, and `i` is now equal to `n - 1`. The values of `x` and `y` are still the first and second elements of `ls`, respectively.
