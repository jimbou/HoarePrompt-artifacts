Output State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The n integers in the second line are positive integers and are in ascending order. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, ls is a list of n positive integers in ascending order.**

In this output state, the value of t has decreased by 1 because one test case has been processed. The stdin now contains t - 1 test cases. The values of n, f, a, and b have been assigned from the first line of the test case, and ls has been assigned a list of n positive integers in ascending order from the second line of the test case.
