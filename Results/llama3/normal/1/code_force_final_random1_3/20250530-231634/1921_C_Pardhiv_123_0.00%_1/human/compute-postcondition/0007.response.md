To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ls`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `ls`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `ls` has at least 3 positive integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, `ls` must have at least 4 positive integers for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, `ls` is a list of at least 4 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 3, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b`**
