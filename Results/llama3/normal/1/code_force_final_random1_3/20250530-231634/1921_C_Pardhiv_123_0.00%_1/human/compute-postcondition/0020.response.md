To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ls`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `ls` has at least 2 elements (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(ls)`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ls` to have at least 2 elements.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we need to adjust its state to be within the range of the loop. Since the range starts from 1, we can set `i` to be 1.

The other variables, such as `t`, `stdin`, `f`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 2 and greater than 2, `stdin` is empty, `ls` is a list of at least 2 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a` * (`ls[i]` - `ls[i - 1]`) and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n - 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer**
