To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(ls)):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `ls`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `ls` is a list of at least 2 positive integers in ascending order.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, `ls` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue, since `i` is now 2 and the loop iterates up to `len(ls) - 1`.

The other variables `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 2 and greater than 2, `stdin` is empty, `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a` * (`ls[1]` - `ls[0]`) and `b`.**
