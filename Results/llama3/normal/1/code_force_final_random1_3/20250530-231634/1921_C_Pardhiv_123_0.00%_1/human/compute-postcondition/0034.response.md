Output State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1, stdin is empty, ls is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, i is n - 1, f is decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b for all i from 1 to n - 1, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are still dependent on the value of f.
