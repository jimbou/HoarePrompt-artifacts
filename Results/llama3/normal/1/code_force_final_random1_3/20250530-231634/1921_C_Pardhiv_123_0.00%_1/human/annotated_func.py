#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The n integers in the second line are positive integers and are in ascending order.
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0, stdin is empty, ls is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, i is n - 1, f is decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b for all i from 1 to n - 1, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n positive integers in ascending order. The function calculates the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b for each pair of consecutive integers in the second line and subtracts this value from f. If f is greater than 0 after all calculations, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
