The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and ls, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ls`. If `i` is less than `len(ls)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `ls` is a list of at least 3 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `ls` must have at least 4 integers.
State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * (y - x)` and `b` and also decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of at least 4 integers, `i` is 3, `x` is the first element of `ls`, `y` is the second element of `ls`.**
