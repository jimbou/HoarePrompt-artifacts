To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ls`. The loop will execute if `ls` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to the length of `ls`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ls` to have at least 2 elements.

State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, ls is a list of at least 2 positive integers in ascending order, i is 1**
