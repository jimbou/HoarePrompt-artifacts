Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of four integers (n, f, a, and b) and a list of n positive integers in ascending order.
2.  It iterates over the list of integers, starting from the second integer (index 1), and calculates the minimum of two values: the product of a and the difference between the current integer and the previous integer (a \* (ls\[i] - ls\[i - 1])), and b. This calculation represents the minimum energy consumption between keeping the phone on and turning it off and on.
3.  The program subtracts the calculated minimum energy consumption from f, which represents the remaining charge in the phone.
4.  After processing all integers in the list, the program checks if the remaining charge f is greater than 0. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, and it correctly handles the input and output as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
