Output State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 4 and greater than 0, n is an integer, f is an integer decreased by the minimum of a * (y - x) and b and also decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b and also decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b and also decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b and so on until i is equal to n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, ls is a list of n integers, i is n - 1, x is the first element of ls, y is the second element of ls. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t has been decreased by 1, but it is still a positive integer greater than 0. The values of the other variables remain the same. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' is still dependent on the value of f.
