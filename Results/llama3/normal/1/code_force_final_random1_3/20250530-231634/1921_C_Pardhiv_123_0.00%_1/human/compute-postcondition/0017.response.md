Output State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 2, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, ls is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, i is n - 1, f is decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b for all i from 1 to n - 1. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

The value of t is decreased by 1, so it is now a positive integer decreased by 2. The number of test cases in stdin is also decreased by 1, so it now contains t - 2 test cases. The values of ls, i, and f are not affected by the code, so they remain the same. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' is still based on the value of f.
