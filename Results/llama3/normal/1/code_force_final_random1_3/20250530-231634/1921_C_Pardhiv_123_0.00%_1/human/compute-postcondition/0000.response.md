The code `t = int(input(''))` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers.

When the code `t = int(input(''))` is executed, it reads the first integer from the standard input, which is the number of test cases. Let's call this integer `t`. The value of `t` is now assigned to the variable `t`.

The output state is: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The n integers in the second line are positive integers and are in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The n integers in the second line are positive integers and are in ascending order.**
