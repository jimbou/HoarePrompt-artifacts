Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * (y - x)` and `b` and also decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of at least 3 integers, `i` is 2, `x` is the first element of `ls`, `y` is the second element of `ls`.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated to be decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b`, in addition to its previous decrease by the minimum of `a * (y - x)` and `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
