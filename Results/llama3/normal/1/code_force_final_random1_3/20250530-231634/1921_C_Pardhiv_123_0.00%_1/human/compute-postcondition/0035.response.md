According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1. Since t is already greater than 1, it is already greater than 0, so no adjustments are needed to t. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1, stdin is empty, ls is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, i is n - 1, f is decreased by the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b for all i from 1 to n - 1, n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer**
