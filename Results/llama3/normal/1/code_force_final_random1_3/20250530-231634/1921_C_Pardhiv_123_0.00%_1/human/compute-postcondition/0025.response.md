Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 2 and greater than 2, `ls` is a list of at least 4 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a` * (`ls[3]` - `ls[2]`) and `b`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer decreased by 2 and greater than 2. The list `ls` remains a list of at least 4 positive integers in ascending order. The value of `i` remains 3. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as integers. The value of `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a` multiplied by the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` (i.e., `ls[3]` - `ls[2]`) and `b`.
