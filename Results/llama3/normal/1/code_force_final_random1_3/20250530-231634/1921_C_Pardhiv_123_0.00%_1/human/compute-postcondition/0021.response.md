Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 2 and greater than 2, `stdin` is empty, `ls` is a list of at least 2 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a` * (`ls[1]` - `ls[0]`) and `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` * (`ls[1]` - `ls[0]`) and `b` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ls` is still in ascending order, and `i` is still 1. The input `stdin` is still empty.
