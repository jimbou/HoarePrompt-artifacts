Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 2 and greater than 2, `stdin` is empty, `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a` * (`ls[2]` - `ls[1]`) and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer decreased by 2 and greater than 2. The stdin remains empty. The list `ls` remains a list of at least 3 positive integers in ascending order. The value of `i` remains 2. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as integers. The value of `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and third elements of `ls` and `b`.
