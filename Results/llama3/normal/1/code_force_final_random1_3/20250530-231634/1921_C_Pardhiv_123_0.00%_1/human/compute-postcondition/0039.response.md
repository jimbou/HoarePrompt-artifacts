To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(ls)):`. The objects involved are `i` and `ls`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `ls` is a list of at least 2 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The length of `ls` is not changed, but since `i` is now 2, the loop will execute again if `ls` has at least 3 elements.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 2
* `ls` is a list of at least 3 integers

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 3 and greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * (y - x)` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `ls` is a list of at least 3 integers, `i` is 2, `x` is the first element of `ls`, `y` is the second element of `ls`.**
