stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The n integers in the second line are positive integers and are in ascending order.
