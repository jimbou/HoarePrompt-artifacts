Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 2, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b`**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ls` still contains at least 3 positive integers in ascending order, and `i` is still 2. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t - 1`.
