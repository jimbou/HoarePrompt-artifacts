This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n positive integers in ascending order. The function calculates the minimum of a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]) and b for each pair of consecutive integers in the second line and subtracts this value from f. If f is greater than 0 after all calculations, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
