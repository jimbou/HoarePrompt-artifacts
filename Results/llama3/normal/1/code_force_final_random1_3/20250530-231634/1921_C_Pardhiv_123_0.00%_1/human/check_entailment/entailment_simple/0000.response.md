Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. 

The program iterates over the list of message sending moments, and for each moment, it subtracts the minimum of the charge consumption per unit of time multiplied by the time difference between the current and previous moments, and the charge consumption when turned off and on sequentially. This is because Stepan can either keep the phone on and consume charge per unit of time, or turn it off and on to consume a fixed amount of charge.

After iterating over all moments, the program checks if the remaining charge is greater than 0. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all the messages. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the case where the charge consumption per unit of time is less than the charge consumption when turned off and on sequentially, as well as the case where the charge consumption per unit of time is greater than or equal to the charge consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
