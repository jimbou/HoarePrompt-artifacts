Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, `ls` is a list of at least 4 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 3, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b`**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer decreased by 1, the number of test cases in stdin remains `t - 1`, the list `ls` remains unchanged with at least 4 positive integers in ascending order, `i` remains 3, and `f` is further decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b`.
