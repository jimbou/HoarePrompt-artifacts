Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes three parameters: n, row1, and row2, which represent the number of columns, the first row of the grid, and the second row of the grid, respectively. It checks whether the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) based on the given row configurations. The function returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the destination and 'No' otherwise.

func_2 reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results. It takes no arguments but reads from standard input. For each test case, it reads an even positive integer n and two strings row1 and row2 of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It then calls func_1 with these inputs and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results as a sequence of values, each representing the result of calling func_1 with the given arguments.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The func_1 function correctly checks whether the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) based on the given row configurations, and the func_2 function correctly reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
