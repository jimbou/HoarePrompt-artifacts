Output State: **t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, n is an even positive integer, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to t. Since t was initially a positive integer, it remains a positive integer. The second line creates an empty list called results. The third line is a comment and does not affect any variables. 

After the execution of the code, t is now an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs, and the values of n, row1, and row2 remain unchanged.
