Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, results is a list containing at least four elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is 2, stdin contains t-11 inputs: each input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `results` now contains at least four elements because the code appends the return value of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to it. The value of `n` is updated to an even positive integer, which is the input from `stdin`. The strings `row1` and `row2` are also updated to strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, which are the next two inputs from `stdin`. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Finally, `stdin` now contains `t-11` inputs because three inputs have been consumed by the code.
