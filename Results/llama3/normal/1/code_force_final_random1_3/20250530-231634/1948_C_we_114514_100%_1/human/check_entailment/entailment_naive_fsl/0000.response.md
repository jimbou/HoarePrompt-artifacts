Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The function `func_1` checks for two conditions:

1. If there is a pair of cells in the first row where the arrow points to the left and the corresponding cells in the second row also point to the left, it returns 'No'. This is because the robot cannot move to the right in this case.
2. If the last cell in the first row points to the left and the second last cell in the second row also points to the left, it returns 'No'. This is because the robot cannot move to the right in this case.

If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the given grid and arrow directions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
