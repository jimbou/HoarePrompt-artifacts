Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, results is a list containing t elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is t-1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable t remains unchanged, the list results will contain t elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), n remains an even positive integer, row1 and row2 remain strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, the loop counter _ will be t-1, and there will be no more inputs left in stdin.
