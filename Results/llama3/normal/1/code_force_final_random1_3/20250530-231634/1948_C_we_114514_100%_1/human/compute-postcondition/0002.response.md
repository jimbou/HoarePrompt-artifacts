Output State: **t is an integer that must be greater than 0, results is a list containing one element which is the return value of func_1(n, row1, row2), stdin contains t-4 inputs: each input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is 0**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an even positive integer. Then, it reads two strings from stdin and assigns them to `row1` and `row2`, respectively. These strings are of length `n` and consist of '<' and '>' characters. The code then calls the function `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2` as arguments and appends the return value to the `results` list. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `_` is still 0. Stdin now contains `t-4` inputs, each a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters.
