Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes the number of columns (n), the first row (row1), and the second row (row2) as input and returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) and 'No' otherwise. func_2 reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). It checks for two conditions:

1. If there is a '<' in the first row at an odd index (2*i + 1) and either a '<' in the second row at the previous even index (2*i) or a '<' in the second row at the next even index (2*i + 2), the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).
2. If the last character in the first row is '<' and the second last character in the second row is '<', the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).

If neither of these conditions is true, the program returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
