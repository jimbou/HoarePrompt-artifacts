Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `half_n` is an integer equal to half of the value of `n`, `i` is `half_n - 1`. If `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `i` has reached `half_n - 1`. The program has checked all the conditions specified in the loop body and has not returned 'No' if the conditions are not met. If the conditions are met, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.
