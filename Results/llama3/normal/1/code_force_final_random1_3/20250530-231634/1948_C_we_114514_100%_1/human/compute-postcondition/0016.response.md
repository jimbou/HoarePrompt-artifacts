Functionality: **Determines whether a robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) based on the given row configurations. The function takes three parameters: a positive even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the destination and 'No' otherwise, considering the robot's movement restrictions imposed by the row configurations.**
