Postcondition: **`n` is a positive even integer, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `half_n` is an integer equal to half of the value of `n`, `i` is `half_n - 1`. If `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program does not return any value. The current value of `row1[n - 1]` is '<' and the current value of `row2[n - 2]` is '<'.**
