The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will print the elements of the `results` list, separated by newline characters (`\n`).

Since `results` is a list containing `t` elements, which are the return values of `func_1(n, row1, row2)`, the output will be a sequence of `t` values, each representing the result of calling `func_1` with the given arguments.

Here, `n` is an even positive integer, and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The exact values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `results` list.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sequence of `t` values, each representing the result of calling `func_1` with the given arguments.

Output: **a sequence of t values, each representing the result of calling func_1 with the given arguments (where t is an integer greater than 0)**
