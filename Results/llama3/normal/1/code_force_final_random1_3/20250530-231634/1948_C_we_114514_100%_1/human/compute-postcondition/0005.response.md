To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current iteration number, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than the current iteration number, which is 1. Therefore, `t` must be at least 2.

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution. Its value is not relevant to the loop's state.

The other variables `results`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `stdin` are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `results` is a list containing at least three elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), `n` is an even positive integer, `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-8` inputs: each input is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters.**
