Functionality: **This function reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results. It takes no arguments but reads from standard input. For each test case, it reads an even positive integer n and two strings row1 and row2 of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It then calls another function func_1 with these inputs and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results as a sequence of values, each representing the result of calling func_1 with the given arguments.**
