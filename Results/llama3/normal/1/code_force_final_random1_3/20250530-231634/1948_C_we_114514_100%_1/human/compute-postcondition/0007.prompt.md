Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, n is an even positive integer, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    row1 = input()
    row2 = input()
    results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer that must be greater than 0, results is a list containing one element which is the return value of func_1(n, row1, row2), stdin contains t-4 inputs: each input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, results is a list containing at least three elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is 1, stdin contains t-8 inputs: each input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, results is a list containing at least four elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is 2, stdin contains t-11 inputs: each input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
