Output State: **The program returns 'Yes'.**

This means that the program has not encountered any conditions that would cause it to return 'No', based on the initial state of the variables. Specifically, it means that either `row1[2 * i + 1]` is not '<' or neither `row2[2 * i]` nor `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', and also either `row1[n - 1]` is not '<' or `row2[n - 2]` is not '<'. The program has successfully passed these checks and returns 'Yes'.
