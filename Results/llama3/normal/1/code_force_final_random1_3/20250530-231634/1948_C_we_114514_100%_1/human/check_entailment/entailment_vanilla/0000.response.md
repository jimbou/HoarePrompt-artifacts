Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of columns `n`, and the two rows of arrows as input, and returns 'Yes' if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) and 'No' otherwise. `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  `func_1` calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`, which is correct since `n` is even.
2.  The function then iterates over the first `half_n - 1` pairs of columns. For each pair, it checks if the arrow in the first row points left (`row1[2 * i + 1] == '<'`) and if either the arrow in the second row points left (`row2[2 * i] == '<'`) or the arrow two columns to the right points left (`row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'`). If this condition is true, it returns 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). This logic is correct because if the robot moves down and then follows the arrow, it will be stuck in an infinite loop.
3.  After the loop, the function checks if the arrow in the last column of the first row points left (`row1[n - 1] == '<'`) and if the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row points left (`row2[n - 2] == '<'`). If both conditions are true, it returns 'No'. This logic is correct because the robot will be stuck in the last column.
4.  If none of the above conditions are true, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
5.  `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results. It correctly calls `func_1` with the input values and appends the result to the `results` list.

Based on this analysis, the program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
