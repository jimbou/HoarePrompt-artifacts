Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, results is a list containing at least three elements which are the return values of func_1(n, row1, row2), n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is 1, stdin contains t-8 inputs: each input is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.**

The code block reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is an even positive integer, and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It then appends the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to the list `results`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not used or modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t-8` inputs, as three inputs have been read.
