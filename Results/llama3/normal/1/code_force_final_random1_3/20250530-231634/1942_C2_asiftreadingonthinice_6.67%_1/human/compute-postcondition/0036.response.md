Output State: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 1, ans is x + y - 1, tmp is an empty list, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. The current value of the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is 2.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it is now `x + y - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is still being printed. The difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is still 2.
