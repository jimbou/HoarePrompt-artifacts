Postcondition: ***ans is increased by y, ii is ii + 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, tmp is an empty list, i is equal to the length of a - 1, and the values of other variables remain unchanged. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of a is 2, then ans is increased by y + 1. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the two elements minus 1, then ans is increased by half of the difference between the two elements, ii is increased by 1, y is decreased by half of the difference between the two elements minus 1, and tmp contains half of the difference between the two elements. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is not equal to 2. The current value of a[0] plus n minus a[len(a) - 1] is even, and the current value of y is greater than half of the difference between a[i] and a[i - 1] minus 1.***
