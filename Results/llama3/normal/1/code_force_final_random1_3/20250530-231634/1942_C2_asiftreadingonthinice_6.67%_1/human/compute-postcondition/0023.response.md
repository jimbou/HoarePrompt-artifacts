Output State: **tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is equal to the length of a - 1. The difference between the first element of a and the last element of a plus n is equal to 2. If a[i] - a[i - 1] equals 2 for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1, then ans is an integer equal to x + y - 1 + the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in a equals 2 plus 1. Otherwise, if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) is even and y is greater than (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1 for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1, then the current value of y is y minus the sum of ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1) for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1, tmp is a list containing the sum of ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1, ans is the sum of ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1 plus 1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of ans has been incremented by 1. This means that if the difference between consecutive elements in a is always 2, ans is now x + y + the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in a equals 2. If the difference between consecutive elements in a is even and y is greater than half of this difference minus 1, ans is now the sum of half of the differences between consecutive elements in a plus 1. Otherwise, ans is now x + y - 1.
