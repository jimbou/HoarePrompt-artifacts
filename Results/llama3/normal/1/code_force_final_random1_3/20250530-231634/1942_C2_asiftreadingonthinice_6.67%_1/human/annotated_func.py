#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
    tt = int(input())
    for ii in range(tt):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = x + y - 2
        
        tmp = []
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
                tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
                ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
                y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
        
        if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
        
        ans += y
        
        print(min(ans, n - 2))
        
    #State: tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains 0 test cases, ii is tt - 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, tmp is an empty list, i is equal to the length of a - 1, ans is increased by the value of y, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, and y) and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It then calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all numbers in the list consecutive, considering the constraints of x and y. The function prints the minimum number of operations for each test case, which is the minimum value between the calculated answer and n-2.
