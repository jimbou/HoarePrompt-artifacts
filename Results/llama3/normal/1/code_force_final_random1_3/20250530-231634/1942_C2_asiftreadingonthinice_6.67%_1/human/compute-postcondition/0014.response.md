Postcondition: **tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the second and first elements of a minus 1, then y is decreased by the difference between the second and first elements of a minus 1, ans is the sum of half of the difference between the second and first elements of a, and tmp is a list containing half of the difference between the second and first elements of a.**
