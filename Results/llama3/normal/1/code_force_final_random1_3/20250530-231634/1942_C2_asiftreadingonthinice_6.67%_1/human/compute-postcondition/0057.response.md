Output State: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1 plus the original value of y minus (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is equal to the length of a - 1, tmp contains half of the difference between the first element of a, n, and the last element of a, and the minimum value between ans plus half of the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a and n - 2 is being printed. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is 2, then ans is x + y - 1 plus the number of times the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is 2. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is even and y is greater than half of the difference minus 1, then y is updated to y minus half of the difference plus 1, tmp contains half of the difference, and the minimum value between ans plus half of the difference and n - 2 is being printed. Otherwise, ans is x + y - 2 plus the sum of (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise ans is x + y - 2, and y is y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise y remains unchanged, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. The sum of the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is not equal to 2. Additionally, the current value of y is greater than (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1 and the sum of the first element of a, n, and the last element of a is even.**
