Output State: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 1, tmp is a list containing the value (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2, ans is x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2, and y is y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1.**

The code block modifies the values of `tmp`, `ans`, and `y`. The first line appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. The second line increments `ans` by the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. The third line decrements `y` by the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
