Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is equal to the length of a - 1, ans is x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 1, tmp is a list, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is 2, then ans is x + y - 1. Otherwise, ans is x + y - 2 plus (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise ans is x + y - 2, and y is y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise y remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 2, tmp is a list. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is 2, then ans is x + y - 1 and the minimum value between ans + 1 and n - 2 is being printed. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is even and y is greater than half of the difference minus 1, then y is updated to y minus half of the difference plus 1, tmp contains half of the difference, and the minimum value between ans plus half of the difference and n - 2 is being printed. Otherwise, ans is x + y - 2 plus (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise ans is x + y - 2, and y is y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise y remains unchanged, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains `tt-3` test cases, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` contains `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
