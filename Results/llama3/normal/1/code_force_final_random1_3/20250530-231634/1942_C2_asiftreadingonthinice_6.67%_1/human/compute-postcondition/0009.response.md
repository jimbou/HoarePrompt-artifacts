Postcondition: ***tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2, tmp is a list, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 1, and the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a is not equal to 2. If the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a is even and y is greater than the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a divided by 2 minus 1, then y is decreased by the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a divided by 2 minus 1, ans is increased by the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a divided by 2, and tmp contains the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a divided by 2.***
