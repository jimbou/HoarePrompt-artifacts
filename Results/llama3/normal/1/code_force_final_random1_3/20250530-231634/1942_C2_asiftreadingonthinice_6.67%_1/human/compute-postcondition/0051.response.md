Postcondition: **`tt` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains `tt-3` test cases, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` contains `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**
