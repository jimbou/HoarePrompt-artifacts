Postcondition: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 1, ans is x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed, and the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a is not equal to 2. The current value of the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a is even and y is greater than half of this difference minus 1.**
