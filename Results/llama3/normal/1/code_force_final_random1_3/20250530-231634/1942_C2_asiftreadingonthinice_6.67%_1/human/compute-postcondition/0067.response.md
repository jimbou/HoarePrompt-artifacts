Output State: **ans is increased by y + 1, ii is ii + 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, tmp is an empty list, i is 1, and the values of other variables remain unchanged. The difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of ans has been increased by 1 in addition to its previous increase by y. The values of ii, n, x, y, a, tmp, and i remain unchanged. The difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is still 2.
