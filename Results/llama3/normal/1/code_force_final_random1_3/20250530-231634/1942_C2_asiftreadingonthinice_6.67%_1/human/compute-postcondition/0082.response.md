Postcondition: ***ans, ii, n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, tmp is a list containing half of the difference between the second and first elements of a, i is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of a is 2, then ans is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of a is not 2, then if the difference is even and y is greater than half of the difference minus 1, then ans is increased by half of the difference, tmp contains half of the difference between the second and first elements of a and half of the difference between the third and second elements of a, and y is decreased by half of the difference minus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
