Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x) is equal to the number of sides of the polygon (n). In this case, the program will try to access an index out of range in the list `a` when calculating `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]`. This will result in an `IndexError`.

For example, if the input is `4 4 0` and the vertices Bessie has chosen are `1 2 3 4`, the program will try to access `a[4]` which does not exist, resulting in an `IndexError`.

To fix this, the program should add a check to ensure that `x` is not equal to `n` before trying to access `a[len(a) - 1]`.
