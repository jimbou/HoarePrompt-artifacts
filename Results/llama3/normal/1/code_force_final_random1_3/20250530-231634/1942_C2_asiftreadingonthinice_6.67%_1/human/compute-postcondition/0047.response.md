The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a and variable i. If the list a has at least 3 elements and i is less than the length of the list a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 3 elements, i is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list a must have at least 4 elements and i is 3.
State: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 3, tmp is a list**
