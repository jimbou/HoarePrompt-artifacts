Postcondition: **ans, ii, n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, tmp is a list containing half of the difference between the second and first elements of a. i is 2. If the difference between the third and second elements of a is 2, ans is increased by y + 1 and ii is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the difference between the second and first elements of a is even and y is greater than half of this difference minus 1, ans is increased by y plus half of the difference between the third and second elements of a, ii is increased by 1, y is decreased by half of the difference between the third and second elements of a plus 1, and tmp is increased by half of the difference between the third and second elements of a. Otherwise, ans and tmp remain unchanged, ii is increased by 1, and y remains unchanged.**
