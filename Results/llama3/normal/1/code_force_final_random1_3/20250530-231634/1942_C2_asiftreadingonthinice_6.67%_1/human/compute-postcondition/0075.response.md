Output State: **ans is increased by y plus half of the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a, ii is ii + 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer minus half of the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a plus 1, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, tmp is a list that contains half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a, plus half of the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a, i is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by the initial value of `y` plus half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`. The value of `y` has been decreased by half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`, minus 1. The list `tmp` now contains two elements: half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, and half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
