Postcondition: ***ans, ii, n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, tmp is a list containing half of the difference between the second and first elements of a. If (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, then ans is increased by half of the difference between the third and second elements of a, tmp contains half of the difference between the second and first elements of a and half of the difference between the third and second elements of a, y is decreased by half of the difference between the third and second elements of a minus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
