Output State: **tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer minus the difference between the second and first elements of a minus 1, ans is the sum of the difference between the second and first elements of a divided by 2, tmp is a list containing the difference between the second and first elements of a divided by 2, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 2**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `y`, and `tmp`. The first line appends the difference between the second and first elements of `a` divided by 2 to `tmp`. The second line adds the same value to `ans`. The third line subtracts the difference between the second and first elements of `a` minus 1 from `y`. The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
