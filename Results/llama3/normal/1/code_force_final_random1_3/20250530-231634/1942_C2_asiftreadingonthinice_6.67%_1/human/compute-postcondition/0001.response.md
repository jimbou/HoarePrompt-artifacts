The only variable in the loop head is `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tt`. If `tt` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `tt` is greater than 0 and `ii` is now 0. Also, stdin contains t-1 test cases, so t must be at least 1 to have t-1 test cases, so tt must be at least 1.

State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
