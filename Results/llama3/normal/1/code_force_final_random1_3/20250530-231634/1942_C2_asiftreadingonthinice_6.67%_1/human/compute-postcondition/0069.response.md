Postcondition: **ans is increased by y, ii is ii + 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, tmp is an empty list, i is 1, and the values of other variables remain unchanged. The difference between the second element of a and the first element of a is not equal to 2. The current value of the difference between the element of a at index i and the element of a at index i-1 is even and the current value of y is greater than half of the difference between the element of a at index i and the element of a at index i-1 minus 1.**
