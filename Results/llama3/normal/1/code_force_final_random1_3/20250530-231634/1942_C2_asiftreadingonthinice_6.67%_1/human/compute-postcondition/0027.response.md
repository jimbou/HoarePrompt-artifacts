Postcondition: ***tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is equal to the length of a - 1. If the difference between the first element of a and the last element of a plus n is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the last element of a and the second last element of a minus 1 minus ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1), then tmp is a list containing the value of (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 and ans is the sum of the original value of ans and (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
