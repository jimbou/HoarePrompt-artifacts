Output State: **ans is increased by y, ii is ii + 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, tmp is an empty list, i is equal to the length of a - 1.**

The code `ans += y` increments the value of `ans` by `y`. The initial state already states that `ans` is increased by `y`, so this code simply reinforces that condition. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional clarification that `ans` is indeed increased by `y`.
