Postcondition: ***tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 3. If (a[3] - a[2]) is even and y is greater than (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1, then y is updated to y minus ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1), tmp is a list containing ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2), ans is ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2).***
