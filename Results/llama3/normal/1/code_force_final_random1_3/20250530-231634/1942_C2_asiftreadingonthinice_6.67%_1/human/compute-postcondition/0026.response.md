Output State: **tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer greater than half of the difference between the last element of a and the second last element of a minus 1 minus ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1), a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is equal to the length of a - 1, tmp is a list containing the value of (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2, ans is the sum of the original value of ans and (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2.**

In this output state, the value of tt, ii, n, x, and stdin remains unchanged. The value of y is updated by subtracting ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1) from its original value. The list tmp now contains the value of (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2. The value of ans is updated by adding (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 to its original value. The value of i remains the same, which is the length of a - 1.
