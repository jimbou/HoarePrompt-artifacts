Output State: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer decreased by (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 3, tmp is a list containing (a[3] - a[2]) // 2, ans is increased by (a[3] - a[2]) // 2**

The code block modifies the values of `y`, `tmp`, and `ans`. The first line appends the value of `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. The second line increments the value of `ans` by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. The third line decrements the value of `y` by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`. The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not modified by the code block, so it remains 3.
