Postcondition: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 2, tmp is a list. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is 2, then ans is x + y - 1 and the minimum value between ans + 1 and n - 2 is being printed. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is even and y is greater than half of the difference minus 1, then y is updated to y minus half of the difference plus 1, tmp contains half of the difference, and the minimum value between ans plus half of the difference and n - 2 is being printed. Otherwise, ans is x + y - 2 plus (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise ans is x + y - 2, and y is y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise y remains unchanged, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed.**
