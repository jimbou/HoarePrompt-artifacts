Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains `tt-3` test cases, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `tmp` is a list, and the minimum value between `ans + 1` and `n - 2` is being printed. The current value of the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n` is 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2, then `ans + 1` is `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, then `y` is updated to `y` minus half of the difference plus 1, `tmp` contains half of the difference, and the minimum value between `ans + 1` plus half of the difference and `n - 2` is being printed. Otherwise, `ans + 1` is `x + y - 2` plus the sum of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `ans + 1` is `x + y - 2`, and `y` is `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, and the minimum value between `ans + 1` and `n - 2` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The minimum value between the updated `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed.
