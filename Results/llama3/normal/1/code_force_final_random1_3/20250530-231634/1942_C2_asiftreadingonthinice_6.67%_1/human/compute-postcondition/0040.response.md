Postcondition: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 1, tmp is a list, ans is x + y - 2 plus (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise ans is x + y - 2, and y is y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1 if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, otherwise y remains unchanged, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed.**
