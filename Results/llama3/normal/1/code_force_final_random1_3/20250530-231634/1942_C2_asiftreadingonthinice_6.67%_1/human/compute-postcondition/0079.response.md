Output State: **ans is increased by 1, ii, n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, tmp is a list containing half of the difference between the second and first elements of a, i is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The values of `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted and has at least 3 elements, and `tmp` still contains half of the difference between the second and first elements of `a`.
