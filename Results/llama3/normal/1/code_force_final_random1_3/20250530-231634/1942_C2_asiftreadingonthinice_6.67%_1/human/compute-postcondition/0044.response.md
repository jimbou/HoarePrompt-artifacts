Output State: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer minus (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 plus 1, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 2, tmp is a list containing (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2, and the minimum value between ans plus (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 and n - 2 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `tt` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ii` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `y` is decremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` as per the third line of the code. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `tmp` is appended with `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` as per the first line of the code. The value of `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` as per the second line of the code. The minimum value between `ans` plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` and `n - 2` is being printed.
