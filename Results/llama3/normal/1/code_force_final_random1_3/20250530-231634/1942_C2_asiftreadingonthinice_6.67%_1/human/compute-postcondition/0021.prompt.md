Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 1. If the difference between the second element and the first element of a is 2, then ans is an integer equal to x + y - 1. Otherwise, if the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a is not equal to 2, then tmp is a list. If the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a is even and y is greater than the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a divided by 2 minus 1, then y is decreased by the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a divided by 2 minus 1, ans is increased by the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a divided by 2, and tmp contains the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in list a divided by 2. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of a is 2, then ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the difference between the second and first elements of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the second and first elements of a minus 1, then y is decreased by the difference between the second and first elements of a minus 1, ans is the sum of half of the difference between the second and first elements of a, and tmp is a list containing half of the difference between the second and first elements of a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 3. If a[i] - a[i - 1] equals 2, then ans is increased by 1. Otherwise, if (a[3] - a[2]) is even and y is greater than (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1, then y is updated to y minus ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1), tmp is a list containing ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2), ans is ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
