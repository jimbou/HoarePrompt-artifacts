Postcondition: ***ans is increased by y plus half of the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a if the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a minus 1, otherwise ans remains unchanged. ii is increased by 1. n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer minus half of the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a plus 1 if the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a minus 1, otherwise y remains unchanged. a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements. tmp is a list that contains half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a, plus half of the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a if the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a minus 1, otherwise tmp remains unchanged. i is 2.***
