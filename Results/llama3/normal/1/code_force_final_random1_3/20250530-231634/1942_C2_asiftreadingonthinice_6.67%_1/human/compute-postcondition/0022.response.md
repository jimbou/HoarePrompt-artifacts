Postcondition: **tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is equal to the length of a - 1. The difference between the first element of a and the last element of a plus n is equal to 2. If a[i] - a[i - 1] equals 2 for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1, then ans is an integer equal to x + y - 1 + the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in a equals 2. Otherwise, if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) is even and y is greater than (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1 for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1, then the current value of y is y minus the sum of ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1) for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1, tmp is a list containing the sum of ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1, ans is the sum of ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) for all i from 1 to the length of a - 1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2.**
