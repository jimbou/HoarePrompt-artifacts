Postcondition: ***ans is increased by y, ii is ii + 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, tmp is an empty list, i is 1, and the values of other variables remain unchanged. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is 2, then ans is increased by y + 1. If the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a minus 1, then ans is increased by half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a, ii is increased by 1, y is decreased by half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a minus 1, and tmp contains half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
