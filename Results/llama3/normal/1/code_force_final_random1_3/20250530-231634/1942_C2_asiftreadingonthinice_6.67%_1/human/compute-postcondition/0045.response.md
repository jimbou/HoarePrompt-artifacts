Postcondition: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 2, tmp is a list, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is even and y is greater than half of the difference minus 1, then y is updated to y minus half of the difference plus 1, tmp contains half of the difference, and the minimum value between ans plus half of the difference and n - 2 is being printed. Otherwise, the values of y and tmp remain unchanged.**
