Postcondition: **tt is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains tt-3 test cases, i is 3, tmp is a list. If (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, then y is decreased by (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1, tmp contains (a[3] - a[2]) // 2, and ans is increased by (a[3] - a[2]) // 2.**
