Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), `cur` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet).**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `m` as in the initial state. The string `s` will be empty since all its characters have been processed. The variable `cnt` will store the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet). The variable `cur` will be reset to 0. The variable `ans` will store the concatenation of the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet).
