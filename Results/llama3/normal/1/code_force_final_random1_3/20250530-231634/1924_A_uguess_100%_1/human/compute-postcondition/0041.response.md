Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is k, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), cur is 0, ans is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of s that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), cnt is less than n, "NO" is printed, and tmp is either an empty string or the kth character in the alphabet, depending on whether the current value of cur has a bit set at position i.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop counter `i` has reached the value of `k`, and the temporary string `tmp` is either empty or contains the `k`th character of the alphabet, depending on the current value of `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged.
