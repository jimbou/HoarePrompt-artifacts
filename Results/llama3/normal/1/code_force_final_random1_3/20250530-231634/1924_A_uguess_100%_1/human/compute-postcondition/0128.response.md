The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k, ans is a string consisting of characters from s that are at indices that are multiples of k, cur is 0 if the length of s is a multiple of k, otherwise cur is a number between 1 and (1 << k) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in s that have not been added to ans yet, cnt is less than n, 'NO' is printed, and tmp is 'a' if the bit at position i in cur is 0, otherwise tmp is 'b'.**
