To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `ss` and the string `s`.

According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must have at least one character.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`**
