Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, cnt is 0, cur is 0, ans is an empty string.**

The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, k, and m, respectively. It then reads a string from stdin and assigns it to s. The variables cnt, cur, and ans are initialized to 0, 0, and an empty string, respectively. The values of t and i remain unchanged. Stdin now contains t-3 test cases.
