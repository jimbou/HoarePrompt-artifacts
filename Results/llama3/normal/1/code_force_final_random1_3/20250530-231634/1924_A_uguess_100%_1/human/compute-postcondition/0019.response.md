Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 3, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')` which is between 0 and 25, `cur` is increased by 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places, which is equivalent to `cur` is increased by 2 to the power of `cur_ss`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `cur`, which is increased by 2 to the power of `cur_ss`. This means that `cur` is now equal to its original value plus 2 to the power of the value of `cur_ss`, which is between 0 and 25.
