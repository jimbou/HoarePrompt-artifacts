Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 1, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25**

The value of `cur_ss` is assigned the result of subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of `ss`. Since `ss` is the first character in the string `s` and `s` is a string of length at least 1, `ss` is a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z'. Therefore, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. The values of the other variables are not affected.
