To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop counter. According to the code, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`. To determine the next value of `i`, we need to consider the range of `t`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, the loop will execute at most `t` times.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be either 2 or `k+2`.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of `s` divided by `k` rounded up, `ans` is a string containing every `k`th character of the original string `s`, and `cur` is 0.**
