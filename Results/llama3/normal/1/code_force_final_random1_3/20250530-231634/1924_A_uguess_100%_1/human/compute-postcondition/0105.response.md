Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 2 or k+2, stdin contains t-6 test cases, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of ss minus the ASCII value of 'a', cur is 0, cnt is 1, and ans is either the first character of the string s plus the second character of the string s or remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of n, k, m, s, t, i, ss, and cur_ss remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of stdin decreases by 1 because one test case has been processed. The value of cnt is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The value of cur is reset to 0. The value of ans is either the first character of the string s plus the second character of the string s or remains unchanged, depending on the initial value of cur.
