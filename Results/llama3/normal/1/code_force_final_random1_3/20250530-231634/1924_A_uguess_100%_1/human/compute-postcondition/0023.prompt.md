Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m, cnt is 0, cur is 0, ans is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 1, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character in the string `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` is not set to `(1 << k) - 1`, then no changes are made to `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur`. If `cur` is set to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 more than its original value, `ans` is the second character in the string `s` plus its original value, and `cur` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 3, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')` which is between 0 and 25. If `cur` equals to 2 to the power of `k` minus 1, then `cnt` is increased by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is appended with `ss`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
