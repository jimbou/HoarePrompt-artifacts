Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `(1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss)` or `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` or remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` plus the second character of the string `s` or remains unchanged.**

The code increments the value of `cur` by adding `1 << cur_ss` to it. The value of `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25, which is equal to the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. This means that `cur_ss` is a valid index for a bit in the binary representation of `cur`. 

If `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then the value of `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `(1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss)`. 

If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then the value of `cur` becomes 0, `cnt` becomes 1, and `ans` becomes either the first character of the string `s` plus the second character of the string `s` or remains unchanged. 

The values of the other variables are not affected by the code.
