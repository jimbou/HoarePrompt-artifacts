To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ss` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 characters, and `ss` must be the third character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to `cur_ss`, then `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `(1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` or remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` plus the second character of the string `s` or remains unchanged.**
