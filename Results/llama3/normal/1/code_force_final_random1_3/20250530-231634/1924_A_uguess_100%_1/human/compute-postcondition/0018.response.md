Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 3, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')` which is between 0 and 25.**

The value of `cur_ss` is updated to be equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, which is the ASCII value of the third character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. This value is between 0 and 25. The values of the other variables are not affected.
