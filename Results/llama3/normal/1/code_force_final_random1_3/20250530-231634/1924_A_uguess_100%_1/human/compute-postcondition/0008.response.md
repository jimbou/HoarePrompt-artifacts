Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. The bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is set. The current value of `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, indicating that all bits corresponding to the value of `k` are set in `cur`.**
