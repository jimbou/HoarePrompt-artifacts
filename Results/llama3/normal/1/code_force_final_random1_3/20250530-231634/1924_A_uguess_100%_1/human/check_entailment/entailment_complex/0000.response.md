Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input values of n, k, and m, and the string s.
2. It initializes the variables cnt (to count the number of complete sequences found) and cur (to keep track of the current sequence).
3. It iterates through the string s, and for each character, it checks if the character is a new one (i.e., not already present in the current sequence). If it is, it adds the character to the current sequence and updates the cur variable accordingly.
4. If the current sequence is complete (i.e., all k characters are present), it increments the cnt variable and resets the current sequence.
5. After iterating through the entire string s, it checks if the number of complete sequences found (cnt) is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 'YES'.
6. If cnt is less than n, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that is a subsequence of s but not a complete sequence of k distinct characters. It does this by finding the first character that is not present in the current sequence and appending it to the last sequence found, making it a complete sequence of k distinct characters.
7. Finally, it prints the resulting string.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
