To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for ss in s:`.

The only object in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `ss`, which is the current character being processed in the string `s`. Since `ss` is the first character in the string `s` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to move to the next character in the string for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the second character in the string `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur`.**
