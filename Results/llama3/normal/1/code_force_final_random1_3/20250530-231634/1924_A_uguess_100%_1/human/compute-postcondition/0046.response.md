State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 1 or `k+1`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is either an empty string or a string, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), `cur` is 0, `ans` is either the concatenation of the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet) or the concatenation of the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet) and 'a' repeated n-cnt-1 times, and either 'YES' is printed or `ans` is printed.**
