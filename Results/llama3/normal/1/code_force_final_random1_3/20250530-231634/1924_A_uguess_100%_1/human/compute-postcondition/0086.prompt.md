Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k rounded up, `ans` is a string containing every kth character of the original string s, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and 'NO' is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k rounded up, ans is a string containing every kth character of the original string s, if cur & 1 << i == 0, then cur is 0, tmp is 'a', and 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k rounded up, ans is a string containing every kth character of the original string s. If cur & 1 << i == 0, then tmp is 'b' and 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 2 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k rounded up, ans is a string containing every kth character of the original string s. If cur & 1 << i == 0, then tmp is 'c'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
