Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k rounded up, ans is a string containing every kth character of the original string s, and cur is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each character, it checks if the corresponding bit in the variable `cur` is 0. If it is, it sets that bit to 1. If all bits in `cur` are 1 (i.e., `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`), it increments the counter `cnt`, appends the current character to the string `ans`, and resets `cur` to 0. After the loop finishes, `cnt` will be the number of times the loop found all bits in `cur` to be 1, `ans` will contain every `k`th character of the original string `s`, and `cur` will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
