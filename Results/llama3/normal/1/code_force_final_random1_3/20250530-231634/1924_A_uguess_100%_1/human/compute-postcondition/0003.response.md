To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ss` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 1, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`**
