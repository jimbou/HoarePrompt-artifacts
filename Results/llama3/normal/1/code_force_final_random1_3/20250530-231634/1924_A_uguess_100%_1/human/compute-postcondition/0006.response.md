Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 1, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. The bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is now set, i.e., `(cur & 1 << cur_ss) != 0`.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated by setting the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` to 1. This is achieved by performing a bitwise left shift operation on 1 by `cur_ss` places and then adding the result to `cur`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
