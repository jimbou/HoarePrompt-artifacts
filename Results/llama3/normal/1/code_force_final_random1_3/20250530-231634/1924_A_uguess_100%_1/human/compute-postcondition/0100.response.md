Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of the string `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur` remain unchanged.***
