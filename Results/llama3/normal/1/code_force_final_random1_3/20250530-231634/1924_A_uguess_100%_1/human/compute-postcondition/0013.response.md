The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. The value of `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25, equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, where `ss` is the second character in the string `s`. 

The value of `1 << cur_ss` is a power of 2, specifically 2 to the power of `cur_ss`. This value is added to `cur`, which was initially 0.

The output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the second character in the string `s`.
