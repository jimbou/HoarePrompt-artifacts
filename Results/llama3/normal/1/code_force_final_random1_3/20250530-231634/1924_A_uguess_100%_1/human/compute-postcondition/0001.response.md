To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, which already ensures that the loop will execute, so we don't need to adjust `t`. However, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, since the loop will start from the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000). The second line contains a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
