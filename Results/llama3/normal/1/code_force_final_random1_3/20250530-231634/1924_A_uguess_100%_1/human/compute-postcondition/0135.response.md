Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 2 or k+2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, tmp is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to 'z' that are at indices that are multiples of k in the string s, and ans is printed, which is a string consisting of characters from s that are at indices that are multiples of k and 'a' repeated n-cnt-1 times.***
