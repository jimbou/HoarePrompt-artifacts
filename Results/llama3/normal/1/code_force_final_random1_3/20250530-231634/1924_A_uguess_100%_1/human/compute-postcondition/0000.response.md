Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000). The second line contains a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^5. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case has two lines, the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
