Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 2 or k+2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k, ans is a string consisting of characters from s that are at indices that are multiples of k, cur is 0 if the length of s is a multiple of k, otherwise cur is a number between 1 and (1 << k) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in s that have not been added to ans yet.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The variables n, k, m, t, i, and stdin remain unchanged. The string s is the same as the initial string. The variable cnt is the number of times the loop has found a character in s that makes cur equal to (1 << k) - 1, which is at most the length of s divided by k. The string ans consists of characters from s that are at indices that are multiples of k. The variable cur is 0 if the length of s is a multiple of k, otherwise cur is a number between 1 and (1 << k) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in s that have not been added to ans yet.
