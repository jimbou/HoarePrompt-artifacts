Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, ss is the third character in the string, cnt is 1, ans is a string containing the third character of s, and cur is 0.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, making it 1. It then sets `cur` to 0. Finally, it appends the third character of `s` to `ans`, making `ans` a string containing the third character of `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `ss` remain unchanged.
