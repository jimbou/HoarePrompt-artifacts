Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is set to 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`. If `cur` equals (1 shifted left by `k`) minus 1, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur` remain unchanged.***
