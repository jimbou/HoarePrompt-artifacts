Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to `cur_ss`, then `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `(1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` or remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` plus the second character of the string `s` or remains unchanged.**

The code only updates the value of `cur_ss`, which is now equal to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
