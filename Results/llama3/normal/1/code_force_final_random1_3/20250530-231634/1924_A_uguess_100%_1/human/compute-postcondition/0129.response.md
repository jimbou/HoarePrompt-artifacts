Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k, ans is a string consisting of characters from s that are at indices that are multiples of k, cur is 0 if the length of s is a multiple of k, otherwise cur is a number between 1 and (1 << k) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in s that have not been added to ans yet, cnt is less than n, 'NO' is printed, and tmp is 'b'.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to `tmp`. Since `i` is 2, `tmp` becomes 'b'. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
