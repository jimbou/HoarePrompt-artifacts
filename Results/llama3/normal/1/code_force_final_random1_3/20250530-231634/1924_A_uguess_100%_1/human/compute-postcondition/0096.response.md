Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 << cur_ss, `ans` is an empty string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to 1 << cur_ss, which means the bit at the position corresponding to the value of `cur_ss` is now set. The other variables remain unchanged.
