Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `cur` is either 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` plus 1 or (1 shifted left by `k`) minus 1 plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` has been updated by adding 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` to its previous value, which was either 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` or (1 shifted left by `k`) minus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
