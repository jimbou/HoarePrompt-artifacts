Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is k, stdin contains t-5 test cases, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k, ans is a string consisting of characters from s that are at indices that are multiples of k and 'a' repeated n-cnt-1 times, cur is 0 if the length of s is a multiple of k, otherwise cur is a number between 1 and (1 << k) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in s that have not been added to ans yet, cnt is less than n, 'NO' is printed, and tmp is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to 'z' that are at indices that are multiples of k in the string s.**

The code block modifies the `ans` variable by appending the string `tmp` and then appending `n-cnt-1` repetitions of the character 'a'. The `cnt` variable remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `cur` variable also remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The `tmp` variable is not modified, as it is only used as a source for appending characters to `ans`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `t`, `i`, and `stdin`) are not affected by the code.
