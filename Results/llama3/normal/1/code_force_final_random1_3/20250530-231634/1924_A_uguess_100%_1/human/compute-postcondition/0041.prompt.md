Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), `cur` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), `cnt` is less than `n`, "NO" is printed, and `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k must be greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), cur is 0, ans is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of s that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), cnt is less than n, "NO" is printed, and tmp is either an empty string or 'a', depending on whether the current value of cur has a bit set at position i.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the `k`th character in the alphabet), `cur` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the `k`th character in the alphabet), `cnt` is less than `n`, "NO" is printed, and `tmp` is either 'a' if the current value of `cur` has a bit set at position `i`, otherwise `tmp` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is greater than 2, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), cur is 0, ans is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of s that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), cnt is less than n, "NO" is printed, and tmp is either 'b' if the current value of cur has no bit set at position i, otherwise tmp is an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
