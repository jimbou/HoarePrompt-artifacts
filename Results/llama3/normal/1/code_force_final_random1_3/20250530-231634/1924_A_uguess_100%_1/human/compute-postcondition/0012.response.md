Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the second character in the string `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur`.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_ss` has been updated to be the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. This means that `cur_ss` now holds the position of the second character in the alphabet (with 'a' being 0, 'b' being 1, and so on). The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
