Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, cnt is 0, cur is 0, ans is an empty string, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 2 or k+2, stdin contains t-5 test cases
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of the string `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to `cur_ss`, then `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `(1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` or remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` plus the second character of the string `s` or remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to `cur_ss`, then `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `(1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss)` or `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` or remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is the first character of the string `s` plus the third character of the string `s`. If `cur` does not have a bit set at the position corresponding to `cur_ss`, then `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `(1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` or remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
