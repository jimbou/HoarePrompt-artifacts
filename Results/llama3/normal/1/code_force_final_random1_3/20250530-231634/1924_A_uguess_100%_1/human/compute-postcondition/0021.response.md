Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length at least 3, ss is the third character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer equal to ord(ss) - ord('a') which is between 0 and 25, cnt is increased by 1, cur is reset to 0, ans is appended with ss.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, resets the value of `cur` to 0, and appends the value of `ss` to `ans`. The values of `t`, `i`, `stdin`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.
