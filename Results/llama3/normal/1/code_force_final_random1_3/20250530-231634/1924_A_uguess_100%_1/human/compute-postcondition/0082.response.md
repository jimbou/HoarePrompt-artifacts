Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k rounded up, ans is a string containing every kth character of the original string s. If cur & 1 << i == 0, then tmp is 'b' and 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
