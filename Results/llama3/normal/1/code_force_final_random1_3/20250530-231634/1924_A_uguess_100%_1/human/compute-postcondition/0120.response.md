Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of `s` divided by `k`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `s` that are at indices that are multiples of `k`, `cur` is 0 if the length of `s` is a multiple of `k`, otherwise `cur` is a number between 1 and (1 << `k`) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in `s` that have not been added to `ans` yet, `cnt` is less than `n`, 'NO' is printed, and `tmp` is an empty string.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, with the addition of `tmp` being an empty string. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases, and the other variables maintain their relationships and constraints as specified in the initial state.
