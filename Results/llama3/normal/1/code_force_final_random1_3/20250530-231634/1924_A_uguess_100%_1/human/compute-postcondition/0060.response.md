Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, ss is the second character in the string, cnt is 1, ans is a string containing the second character of s, cur is 0, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of the second character of s minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, `cur` has been reset to 0, and `ans` now contains the second character of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
