Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k rounded up, ans is a string containing every kth character of the original string s, and cur is 0. If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed, and the string ans is being printed which contains every kth character of the original string s plus tmp plus (n - cnt - 1) 'a's, where tmp is a string containing the kth letter of the alphabet.***
