Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string, if `cur` is equal to (1 shifted left by `k`) minus 1, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the third character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.***
