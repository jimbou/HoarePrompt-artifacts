To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ss` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least two characters. Therefore, `ss` should be the second character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of the string `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur` remain unchanged.**
