The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again k must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the `k`th character in the alphabet), `cur` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the `k`th character in the alphabet), `cnt` is less than `n`, "NO" is printed, and `tmp` is either 'a' if the current value of `cur` has a bit set at position `i`, otherwise `tmp` is an empty string.**
