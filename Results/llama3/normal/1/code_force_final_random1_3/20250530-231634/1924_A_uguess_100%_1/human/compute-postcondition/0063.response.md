Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is either 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` plus 1 or (1 shifted left by `k`) minus 1 plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`. If `cur` is equal to (1 shifted left by `k`) minus 1, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the third character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `cur_ss` is now assigned the value of the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the conditions on `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` are still dependent on the value of `cur_ss` and `cur`.
