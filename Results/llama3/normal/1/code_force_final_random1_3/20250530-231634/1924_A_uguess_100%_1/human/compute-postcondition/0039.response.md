Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is greater than 2, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is the number of times the string s can be divided into substrings of length k where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), cur is 0, ans is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of s that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), cnt is less than n, "NO" is printed, and tmp is 'b'.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the character 'b' (which is the character at position 2 in the alphabet, since 'a' is at position 0) to the variable `tmp`. The second line breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is part of, but since there is no loop or conditional statement in the provided code snippet, this line does not have any effect. 

The initial state of the variables remains the same, except for `tmp`, which is now 'b'. The value of `i` is used to determine the character assigned to `tmp`, and since `i` is 2, `tmp` becomes 'b'. The other variables are not affected by the code snippet.
