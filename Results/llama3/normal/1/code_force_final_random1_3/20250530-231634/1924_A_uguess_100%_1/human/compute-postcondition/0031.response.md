The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), `cur` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), `cnt` is less than `n`, "NO" is printed, and `tmp` is an empty string**
