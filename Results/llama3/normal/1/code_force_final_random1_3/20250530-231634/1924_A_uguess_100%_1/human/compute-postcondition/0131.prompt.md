Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, stdin contains `t-5` test cases, `cnt` is an integer between 0 and the length of `s` divided by `k`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters from `s` that are at indices that are multiples of `k`, `cur` is 0 if the length of `s` is a multiple of `k`, otherwise `cur` is a number between 1 and (1 << `k`) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in `s` that have not been added to `ans` yet, `cnt` is less than `n`, 'NO' is printed, and `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k, ans is a string consisting of characters from s that are at indices that are multiples of k, cur is 0 if the length of s is a multiple of k, otherwise cur is a number between 1 and (1 << k) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in s that have not been added to ans yet, cnt is less than n, 'NO' is printed, and tmp is 'a' if the bit at position i in cur is 0, otherwise tmp remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k, ans is a string consisting of characters from s that are at indices that are multiples of k, cur is 0 if the length of s is a multiple of k, otherwise cur is a number between 1 and (1 << k) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in s that have not been added to ans yet, cnt is less than n, 'NO' is printed, and tmp is 'a' if the bit at position i in cur is 0, otherwise tmp is 'b'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k, ans is a string consisting of characters from s that are at indices that are multiples of k, cur is 0 if the length of s is a multiple of k, otherwise cur is a number between 1 and (1 << k) - 1 with bits set at positions corresponding to characters in s that have not been added to ans yet, cnt is less than n. If the bit at position i in cur is 0, then tmp is 'a', otherwise tmp is 'b'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
