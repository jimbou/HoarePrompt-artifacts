Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 equal to the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is either `1 << cur_ss` or `(1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is either the first character of the string `s` or remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cur_ss` is still an integer between 0 and 25, representing the ASCII value of the second character in the string `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The value of `cur` is now either `1 << cur_ss` (if `cur` was initially 0) or `(1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss)` (if `cur` was initially `(1 << k) - 1`).
