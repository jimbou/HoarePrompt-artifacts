Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the string `s` can be divided into substrings of length `k` where each substring contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), `cur` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or 'a' to the kth character in the alphabet), `cnt` is less than `n`, "NO" is printed, and `tmp` is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `tmp` which is an empty string. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
