Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, cnt is an integer between 0 and the length of s divided by k rounded up, ans is a string containing every kth character of the original string s, cur is 0, tmp is 'a', and 'NO' is being printed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the character 'a' to the variable tmp, since the ASCII value of 'a' is 97 and the ASCII value of 'a' plus i (which is 0) is still 97. The second line breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is enclosed in, but since we do not have information about the enclosing structure, we cannot determine its exact effect. However, we can conclude that the break statement does not affect any of the variables.
