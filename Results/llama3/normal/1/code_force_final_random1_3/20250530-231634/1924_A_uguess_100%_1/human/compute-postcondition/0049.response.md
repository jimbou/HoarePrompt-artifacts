Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25**

The code assigns the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')` to `cur_ss`. Since `ss` is the first character in the string `s` and `s` must have at least 1 character, `ss` is a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z'. The `ord` function returns the ASCII value of a character, so `ord(ss)` is an integer between 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') and 122 (the ASCII value of 'z'). Subtracting `ord('a')` (which is 97) from this value gives an integer between 0 and 25, which is assigned to `cur_ss`. The other variables are not affected by this code.
