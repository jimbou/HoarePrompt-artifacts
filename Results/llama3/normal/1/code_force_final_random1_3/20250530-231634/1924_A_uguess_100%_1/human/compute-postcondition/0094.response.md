Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 2 or `k+2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_ss` is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, and the ASCII value of 'a' is 97, `cur_ss` will be an integer between 0 and 25, representing the position of the first character in the alphabet. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
