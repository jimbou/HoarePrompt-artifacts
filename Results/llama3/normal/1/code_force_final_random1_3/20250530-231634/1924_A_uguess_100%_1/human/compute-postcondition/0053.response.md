Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. The current value of `cur` is equal to 2^k - 1, which means all bits in `cur` are set to 1 up to the k-th position.**
