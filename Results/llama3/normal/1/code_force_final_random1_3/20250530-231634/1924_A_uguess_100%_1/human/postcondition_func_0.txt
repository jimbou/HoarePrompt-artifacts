This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints output for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. For each test case, it reads three integers (n, k, m) and a string s of length m, then checks if the string contains at least n sequences of k distinct characters. If it does, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and appends a string to the last sequence found, making it a complete sequence of k distinct characters, and prints the resulting string.
