Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, ss is the first character in the string, cnt is 1, ans is a string containing the first character of s, and cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25. The value of cur is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet increments the value of `cnt` by 1, making it 1. It then resets the value of `cur` to 0. Finally, it appends the first character of the string `s` (denoted by `ss`) to the string `ans`, making `ans` contain the first character of `s`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
