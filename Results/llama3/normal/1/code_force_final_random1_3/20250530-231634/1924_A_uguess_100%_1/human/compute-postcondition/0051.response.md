Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is either 1 or k+1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 << cur_ss, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25.**

The value of `cur` is updated by adding 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places, which is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`. The current value of `cur` is now a power of 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`. The states of the other variables are not affected.
