Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length at least 3, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')` which is between 0 and 25. If `cur` equals to 2 to the power of `k` minus 1, then `cnt` is increased by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is appended with `ss`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
