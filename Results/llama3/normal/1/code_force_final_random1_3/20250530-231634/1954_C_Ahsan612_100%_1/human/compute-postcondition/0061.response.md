According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least `i+1` elements and `i` is the current value of `i` plus three. For the loop to be executed one more time, `a` must have at least `i+1` elements and `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Since `i` is the current value of `i` plus three, `a` must have at least `i+4` elements. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` has at least `i+4` elements, `b` is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of `a`, `new` is a list of integers where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `new2` is a list of integers where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus three, and `stdin` contains `2t - 2` lines**
