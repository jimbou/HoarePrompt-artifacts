Output State: **a has at least len(a) elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of integers where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to len(a), and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list 'a' will have at least as many elements as its initial length, the list 'b' will still have elements equal to the corresponding elements of 'a', the list 'new' will contain the minimum values between 'a' and 'b' for each position, the list 'new2' will contain the maximum values between 'a' and 'b' for each position, the variable 'i' will be equal to the length of 'a', and the standard input 'stdin' will still contain 2t - 2 lines.
