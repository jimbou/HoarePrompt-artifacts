Output: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the maximum of a[i] and b[i], i is equal to t, and stdin contains 2t - t - 1 lines if a has at least t elements. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: a string of integers representing the new2 list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the maximum of a[i] and b[i]**
