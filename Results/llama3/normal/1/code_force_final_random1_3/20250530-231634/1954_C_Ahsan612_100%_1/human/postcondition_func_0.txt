This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, followed by 2t lines of integers. It then processes each pair of lines, comparing the integers digit by digit. If the digits are equal, it outputs the maximum digit; otherwise, it outputs the minimum digit for the first differing digit and then swaps the output for the remaining digits. The function repeats this process t times, printing the resulting integers for each pair of input lines.
