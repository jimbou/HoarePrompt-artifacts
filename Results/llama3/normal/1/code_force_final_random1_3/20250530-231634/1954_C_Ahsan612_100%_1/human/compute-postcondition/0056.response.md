Output State: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of integers where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is the current value of i plus one, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines.**

The code block modifies the values of `new[i]`, `new2[i]`, and `i`. The first line updates the value of `new[i]` to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and the second line updates the value of `new2[i]` to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The third line increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and the remaining elements of `new` and `new2` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` is also unaffected.
