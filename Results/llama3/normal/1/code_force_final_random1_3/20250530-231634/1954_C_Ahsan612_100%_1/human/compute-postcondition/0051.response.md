Output State: **a is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of integers where the first two elements are the maximum of the first two elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first two elements are the minimum of the first two elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 2, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `new` now has its second element set to the maximum of the second elements of `a` and `b`, in addition to its first element which was already set to the maximum of the first elements of `a` and `b`. Similarly, the list `new2` now has its second element set to the minimum of the second elements of `a` and `b`, in addition to its first element which was already set to the minimum of the first elements of `a` and `b`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it is not accessed or modified by the code.
