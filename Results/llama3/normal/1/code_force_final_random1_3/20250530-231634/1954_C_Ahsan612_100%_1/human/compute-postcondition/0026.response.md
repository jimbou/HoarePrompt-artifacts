The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. Here's the combined effect of all lines:

*   The first line assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Since `i` is 0, this operation compares the first elements of `a` and `b`, which are equal according to the initial state. Therefore, `new[0]` becomes equal to the first element of `a` (and `b`).
*   The second line assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. Similar to the first line, since `i` is 0, this operation compares the first elements of `a` and `b`, which are equal. Therefore, `new2[0]` also becomes equal to the first element of `a` (and `b`).
*   The third line increments the value of `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The value of `a`, `b`, `new` (except for the first element), `new2` (except for the first element), and `stdin` remain unchanged.

Output State: **a is a non-empty list of integers, b is a list of integers where the first element is equal to the first element of a, new is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the remaining elements are None, new2 is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the remaining elements are None, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 3 lines**
