Output State: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements of a equal the corresponding elements of b, new is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to its original value plus 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, _ is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first line assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Since all elements of `a` equal the corresponding elements of `b`, `new[i]` becomes equal to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). The second line assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. Again, since all elements of `a` equal the corresponding elements of `b`, `new2[i]` also becomes equal to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). The third line increments `i` by 1. No other variables are affected.
