Output State: **a is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the first element is equal to the first element of b, b is a list of integers where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the second element is equal to the second element of a, new is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b, new2 is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 3 lines**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the maximum value between the second elements of `a` and `b` to the second element of `new`. Since `a` and `b` have the same first two elements, the maximum value is the second element of either `a` or `b`. The second line assigns the minimum value between the second elements of `a` and `b` to the second element of `new2`. Similarly, the minimum value is the second element of either `a` or `b`. The third line increments `i` by 1, making it 2. No other variables are affected.
