Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of None values, new2 is a list of None values, i is 0, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of integers with at least one element, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of None values except for the first element which is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, new2 is a list of None values except for the first element which is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, i is 1, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of integers where the first two elements are the maximum of the first two elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first two elements are the minimum of the first two elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 2, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of integers where the first three elements are the maximum of the first three elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first three elements are the minimum of the first three elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 3, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
