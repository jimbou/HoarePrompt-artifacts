Output State: **a is a non-empty list of integers, b is a list of integers where the first element of a equals the first element of b, new is a list of values with the same length as a where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, _ is 0**

In this output state, the first elements of `new` and `new2` have been updated to the maximum and minimum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` remain as None. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `b`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
