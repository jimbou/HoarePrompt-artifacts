Output State: **a has at least i+3 elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of integers where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is the current value of i plus four, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by one, and the elements of `new` and `new2` at index `i` have been updated to be the minimum and maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
