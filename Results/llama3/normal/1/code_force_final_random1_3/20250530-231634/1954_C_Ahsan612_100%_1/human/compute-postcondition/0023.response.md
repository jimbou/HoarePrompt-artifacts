To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `a` is a list of integers
* `b` is a list of integers where all elements of `a` equal the corresponding elements of `b`
* `new` is a list of values with the same length as `a` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`
* `new2` is a list of values with the same length as `a` where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`
* `i` is equal to `len(a)`
* `stdin` contains `2t - 2` lines
* `_` is 0
* A string of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` is being printed
* A string of the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` is being printed

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop counter `_`. Since `_` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented to 1 for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, the `stdin` needs to contain at least one more line for the `input()` function to read, so the number of lines in `stdin` should be increased by 1.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`, `i`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers where all elements of `a` equal the corresponding elements of `b`, `new` is a list of values with the same length as `a` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `new2` is a list of values with the same length as `a` where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `stdin` contains `2t - 1` lines, `_` is 1, and a string of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` is being printed, and a string of the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` is being printed**
