The code prints the elements of the list `new2` as a string, where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`. Since all elements of `b` are equal to the corresponding elements of `a`, the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` will be equal to the elements of `a`. Therefore, the code will print the elements of list `a` as a string.

Output: **the elements of list a as a string**
