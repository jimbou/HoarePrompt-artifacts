Output State: **a is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, b is a list of integers with the same length as a where the first element of a equals the first element of b and a[1] equals b[1], new is a list of values with the same length as a where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `new` and `new2` are updated as follows: the first element of `new` is the maximum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the second element of `new` is the maximum of the second elements of `a` and `b`. Similarly, the first element of `new2` is the minimum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the second element of `new2` is the minimum of the second elements of `a` and `b`. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` are `None`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2.
