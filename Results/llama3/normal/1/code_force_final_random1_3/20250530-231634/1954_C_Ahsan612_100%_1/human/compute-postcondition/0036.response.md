According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to its original value plus 2, and `a` has at least 2 elements. Since `i` is equal to its original value plus 2, it means that `i` has already been incremented twice, so it is currently at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` has at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of `a`, `new` is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of `a` except at index `i-1` where it is the minimum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]` and at index `i` where it is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of `a` except at index `i-1` where it is the maximum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]` and at index `i` where it is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `i` is equal to its original value plus 2, and `stdin` contains `2t - 3` lines**
