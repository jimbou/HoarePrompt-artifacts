Output State: **a has at least 3 elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at index i-1 where it is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], at index i where it is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and at index i+1 where it is the minimum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], new2 is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at index i-1 where it is the maximum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], at index i where it is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and at index i+1 where it is the maximum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], i is equal to its original value plus 3, and stdin contains 2t - 4 lines**

In this final state, the lists `new` and `new2` have been modified to reflect the minimum and maximum values of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
