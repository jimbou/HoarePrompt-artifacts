The variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than the length of a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is equal to its original value plus 3 and a has at least 3 elements, So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of i needed to have been less than the length of a minus 3 and a currently must have at least 4 elements.
State: **a has at least 4 elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at index i-1 where it is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], at index i where it is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and at index i+1 where it is the minimum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], new2 is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at index i-1 where it is the maximum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], at index i where it is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and at index i+1 where it is the maximum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], i is equal to its original value plus 3, and stdin contains 2t - 4 lines**
