Output State: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements of a equal the corresponding elements of b, new is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to len(a), stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, _ is 0.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, with all elements of `a` still equal to the corresponding elements of `b`. The lists `new` and `new2` have been updated such that each element is the minimum and maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The variable `i` has been incremented to the length of the list `a`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements of `a`. The state of the other variables, `stdin` and `_`, remains unchanged.
