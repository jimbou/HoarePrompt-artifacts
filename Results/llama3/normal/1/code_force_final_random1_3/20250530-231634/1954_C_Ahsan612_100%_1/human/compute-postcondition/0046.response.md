To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input, as `_` is a throwaway variable and `range` is a function that generates a sequence of numbers.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more lines in the input. At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains 2t - t - 1 lines. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more line.

State: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the maximum of a[i] and b[i], i is equal to t, and stdin contains 2t - t lines**
