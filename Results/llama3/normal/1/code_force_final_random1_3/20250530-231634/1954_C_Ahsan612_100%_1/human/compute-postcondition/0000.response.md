The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines. Each pair of lines contains two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9. So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines. Each pair of lines contains two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9, input() must be at least 1, _ is 0**
