Output State: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of integers where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to the length of a, and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines.**

The loop continues to execute as long as the current index `i` is less than the length of `a` and the elements at the current index in `a` and `b` are equal. In each iteration, it updates the corresponding elements in `new` and `new2` with the maximum and minimum of the elements at the current index in `a` and `b`, respectively, and increments `i`.

After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, indicating that all elements in `a` and `b` have been processed. The `new` list will contain the maximum of each pair of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, and the `new2` list will contain the minimum of each pair of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `2t - 2` lines.
