Output: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of integers where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to len(a), and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. If i is not equal to len(a), then the function executes as described in the if part. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b is printed**
