The code prints a string of integers where each integer is the minimum of the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`. Since `new` is a list of integers where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, the printed string will contain these minimum values.

Output: **a string of integers representing the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists a and b**
