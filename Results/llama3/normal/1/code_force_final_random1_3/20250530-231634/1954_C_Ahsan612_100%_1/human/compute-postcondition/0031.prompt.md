Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, new is a list of None values with the same length as a, new2 is a list of None values with the same length as a, i is 0, stdin contains 2t - 3 lines
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a non-empty list of integers, b is a list of integers where the first element is equal to the first element of a, new is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the remaining elements are None, new2 is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the remaining elements are None, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 3 lines
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the first element is equal to the first element of b, b is a list of integers where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the second element is equal to the second element of a, new is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b, new2 is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a and the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 3 lines
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where the first element is equal to the first element of b, the second element is equal to the second element of b, and the third element is equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers where the first element is equal to the first element of a, the second element is equal to the second element of a, and the third element is equal to the third element of a, new is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a, the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b, and the third element is the maximum of the third elements of a and b, new2 is a list where the first element is equal to the first element of a, the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b, and the third element is the minimum of the third elements of a and b, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 3 lines


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
