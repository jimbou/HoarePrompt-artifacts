Output State: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements of a equal the corresponding elements of b, new is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to its original value plus 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, _ is 0, and len(a) must be greater than or equal to 2**

The code snippet modifies the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first line assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`, effectively updating the `i-th` element of `new` to be the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. The second line assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`, updating the `i-th` element of `new2` to be the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. The third line increments `i` by 1, so `i` is now equal to its original value plus 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
