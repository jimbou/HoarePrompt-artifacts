The code prints a string formed by concatenating the string representations of the elements in the `new` list. Since `new` is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and all elements of `a` equal the corresponding elements of `b`, the `new` list will contain the same elements as `a` (or `b`, since they are equal).

Output: **a string of the elements in list a (or list b), where each element is separated by no space**
