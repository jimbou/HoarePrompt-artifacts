Output State: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at index i where it is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at index i where it is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], i is equal to its original value plus 1, and stdin contains 2t - 3 lines.**

In this output state, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `new` has been updated at index `i` to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, while the list `new2` has been updated at index `i` to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
