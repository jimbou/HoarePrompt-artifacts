Output State: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements of a equal the corresponding elements of b, new is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to its original value plus 3, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, _ is 0, and len(a) must be greater than 2**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`, `_`, and `len(a)` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now equal to its original value plus 3. The state of `stdin` remains the same, as no input operations are performed.
