Output State: **a has at least 4 elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at index i-1 where it is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], at index i where it is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and at index i+1 where it is the minimum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], new2 is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at index i-1 where it is the maximum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], at index i where it is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and at index i+1 where it is the maximum of a[i+1] and b[i+1], i is equal to its original value plus 4, and stdin contains 2t - 5 lines**

In this final state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `new` and `new2` at index `i` have been updated to be the minimum and maximum of `a` and `b` at that index, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
