The variables in the loop head are i, a, and b, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i, a, and b. If i is less than the length of a and a[i] equals b[i], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, a is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, b is a list of integers with the same length as a where the first element of a equals the first element of b and a[1] equals b[1]. For the loop to execute again, i must be less than the length of a, so a must have at least 3 elements. Also, a[2] must equal b[2]. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, b is a list of integers with the same length as a where the first element of a equals the first element of b and a[1] equals b[1] and a[2] equals b[2], new is a list of values with the same length as a where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, _ is 0**
