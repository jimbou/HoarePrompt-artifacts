Output State: **a has at least t elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the maximum of a[i] and b[i], i is equal to t, and stdin contains 2t - t - 1 lines.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that a has at least t elements, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the maximum of a[i] and b[i], i is equal to t, and stdin contains 2t - t - 1 lines.
