Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines. Each pair of lines contains two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    if i != len(a):
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements of a equal the corresponding elements of b, new is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values with the same length as a where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to len(a), stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, _ is 0, and a string of the minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b is being printed, and a string of the maximum values between corresponding elements of a and b is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2 is a list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the maximum of a[i] and b[i], i is equal to t, and stdin contains 2t - t - 1 lines if a has at least t elements. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: a string of integers representing the new2 list where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a except at indices 0 through t-1 where they are the maximum of a[i] and b[i]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers where all elements are equal to the corresponding elements of a, new is a list of integers where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to len(a), and stdin contains 2t - 2 lines. If i is not equal to len(a), then the function executes as described in the if part. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
