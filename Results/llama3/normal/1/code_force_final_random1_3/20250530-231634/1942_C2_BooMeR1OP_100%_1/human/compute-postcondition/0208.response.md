Postcondition: **`n`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans` is increased by `gap` plus `gap // 2`, `_`, `t`, `st`, `next_elem`, `odd`, `even`, `gap` is the next even gap in the `even` list, if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0 and `n`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans` is increased by 2 times the original value of `y`. Otherwise, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.**
