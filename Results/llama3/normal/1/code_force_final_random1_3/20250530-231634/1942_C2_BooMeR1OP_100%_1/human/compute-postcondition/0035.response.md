Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[2 - 1] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[2 - 1] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to 0 - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to 2 - 1, `next_elem` is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1, otherwise a[i + 1], `gap` is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, `odd` is a list containing two integers which are equal to gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise a list containing one integer which is equal to gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise an empty list, `even` is a list containing two integers: one integer which is equal to (a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1) if i is not equal to x - 1, otherwise (a[0] + n - a[i] - 1) and another integer which is equal to gap if gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise a list containing one integer which is equal to (a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1) if i is not equal to x - 1, otherwise (a[0] + n - a[i] - 1) if gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise an empty list.**

The code appends the value of `gap` to the `odd` list. The value of `gap` is either greater than 1 and an odd number, or not. If `gap` is greater than 1 and an odd number, `odd` now contains two integers equal to `gap`. If `gap` is not greater than 1 or not an odd number, `odd` now contains one integer equal to `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and an odd number, otherwise an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
