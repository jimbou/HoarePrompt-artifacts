Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `_`, `t`, `st`, `next_elem`, `odd`, `even`, and `gap` are as described in the precondition. If `y` is less than half of the second even gap, then `y` is set to 0 and `ans` is increased by twice the second even gap. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
