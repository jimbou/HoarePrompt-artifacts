Output State: **n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 1, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a list containing the last odd gap in a if the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list, even is a list containing the last even gap in a if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is an empty list, gap is the last even gap in even if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in odd. If the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, ans is increased by the sum of all odd gaps, and if y is less than half of the first even gap, ans is increased by 2 times the original value of y. If y is less than half of the last even gap, y is set to 0, ans is increased by gap, and y is decreased by half of gap, and the value of ans is printed. If t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, ans is increased by 1, and now ans is increased by 1. If t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, ans remains unchanged, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1.**
