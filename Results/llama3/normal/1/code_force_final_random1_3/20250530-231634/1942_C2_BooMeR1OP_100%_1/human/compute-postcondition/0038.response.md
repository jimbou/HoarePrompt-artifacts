Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 2, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[2 - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[2 - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to 0 - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to 2 - 1, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1, otherwise a[i + 1], gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1. If gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, odd is a list containing two integers which are equal to gap. If gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, even is a list containing two integers: one integer which is equal to (a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1) if i is not equal to x - 1, otherwise (a[0] + n - a[i] - 1) and another integer which is equal to gap. If gap is not greater than 1 or is not an odd number, odd is a list containing one integer which is equal to gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise an empty list. If gap is not greater than 0 or is not an even number, even is a list containing one integer which is equal to (a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1) if i is not equal to x - 1, otherwise (a[0] + n - a[i] - 1) if gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise an empty list. If gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, even is a list containing three integers: one integer which is equal to (a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1) if i is not equal to x - 1, otherwise (a[0] + n - a[i] - 1), another integer which is equal to gap, and the third integer which is equal to gap. Otherwise, even is a list containing one integer which is equal to (a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1) if i is not equal to x - 1, otherwise (a[0] + n - a[i] - 1) if gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise an empty list.***
