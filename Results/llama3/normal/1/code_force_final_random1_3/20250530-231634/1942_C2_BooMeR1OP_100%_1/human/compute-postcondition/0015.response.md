Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[2] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[2] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is an integer equal to either `x + 1` or `x` depending on whether `t1` is in `st` and `t2` is in `st`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to either `x` or `x - 1` depending on whether `t1` is in `st` and `t2` is in `st`.***
