Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1, odd is a sorted list containing all the odd gaps between consecutive elements in a, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps between consecutive elements in a.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first gap, otherwise ans remains unchanged, odd is a sorted list containing all the odd gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 1 gap, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the first gap in the list, ans is increased by the value of gap, y is decreased by half of the value of gap.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer decreased by half of the value of gap, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first gap, otherwise ans remains unchanged, odd is a sorted list containing all the odd gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 2 gaps, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the second gap in the list, ans is increased by the value of gap.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first gap, otherwise ans remains unchanged, odd is a sorted list containing all the odd gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 3 gaps, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the third gap in the list, ans is increased by the value of the third gap in the list, and y is the original value of y minus half of the third gap if y is less than half of the third gap, otherwise y remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
