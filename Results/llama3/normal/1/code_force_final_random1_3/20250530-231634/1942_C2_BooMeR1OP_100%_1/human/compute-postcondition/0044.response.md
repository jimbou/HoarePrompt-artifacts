Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first gap, otherwise ans remains unchanged, odd is a sorted list containing all the odd gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 1 gap, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the first gap in the list.***
