Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, odd is a sorted list containing all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the last even gap in even if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in odd. If the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, ans is increased by the sum of all odd gaps, and if y is less than half of the first even gap, ans is increased by 2 times the original value of y. If y is less than half of the last even gap, y is set to 0, ans is increased by gap, and y is decreased by half of gap, and the value of ans is printed. If t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, ans is increased by 1, and now ans is increased by 1. If t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, ans remains unchanged, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, odd is a sorted list containing all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 1 gap, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the first gap in the list odd, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1. If y is less than half of the first even gap, y is set to 0. Otherwise, no change is made to y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the gap, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, plus the gap, _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, odd is a sorted list containing all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 2 gaps, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the second gap in the list odd, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the gap, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, plus the gap plus the gap, _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, odd is a sorted list containing all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 3 gaps, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the third gap in the list odd, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
