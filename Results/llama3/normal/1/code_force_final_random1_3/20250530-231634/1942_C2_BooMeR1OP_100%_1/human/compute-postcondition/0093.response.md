Postcondition: ***n is an integer, x is greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, gap is a positive integer equal to the difference between next_elem and a[i] minus 1, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1]. The gap between consecutive elements in a is either less than or equal to 1 or it is even. The current value of gap is greater than 0 and is an even number***
