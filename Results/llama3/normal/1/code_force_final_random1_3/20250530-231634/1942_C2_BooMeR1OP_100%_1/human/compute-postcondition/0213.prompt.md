Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    ans = x - 2
    st = set(a)
    a.sort()
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
            ans += 1
    odd = []
    even = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
            odd.append(gap)
        elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
            even.append(gap)
    odd.sort()
    even.sort()
    for gap in odd:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    for gap in even:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, y is 0, gap is 0, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, x is greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, gap is the last even gap in even, ans is increased by the sum of all even gaps, and if y is less than half of the first even gap, ans is increased by 2 times the original value of y. If y is less than half of the last even gap, y is set to 0, ans is increased by gap, and y is decreased by half of gap, and the value of ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is 0, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, gap is the last even gap in even, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the sum of the original value of ans plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
