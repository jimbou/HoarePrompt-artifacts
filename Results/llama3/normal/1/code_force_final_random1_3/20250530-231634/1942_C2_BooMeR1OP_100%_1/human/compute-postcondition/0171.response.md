Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus 2 times the original value of `y` if `y` is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise `y` is less than half of the last odd gap, `_` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `st` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is a list containing the last odd gap in `a` if the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list, `even` is a list containing the last even gap in `a` if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is an empty list, `gap` is the last even gap in `even` if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in `odd`, and `odd` now contains the last even gap in `even` if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in `odd`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the `odd` list now contains the last even gap in `even` if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in `odd`.
