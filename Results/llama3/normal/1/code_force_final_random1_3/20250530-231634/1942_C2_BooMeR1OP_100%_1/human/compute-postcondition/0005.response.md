Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, ans is an integer equal to x - 2, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n. The current value of t1 is not in st and the current value of t2 is in st.**
