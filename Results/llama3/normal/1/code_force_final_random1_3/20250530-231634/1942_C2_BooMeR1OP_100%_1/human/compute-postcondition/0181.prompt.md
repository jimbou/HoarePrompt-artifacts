Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, gap is the last even gap in even, ans is increased by the sum of all even gaps, and if y is less than half of the first even gap, ans is increased by 2 times the original value of y. If y is less than half of the last even gap, y is set to 0, ans is increased by gap, and y is decreased by half of gap, and the value of ans is printed. If t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, ans is increased by 1, and now ans is increased by 1. If t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, ans remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus 2 times the original value of `y` if `y` is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise `y` is less than half of the last odd gap, `_` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `st` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is a list containing the last odd gap in `a` if the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list, `even` is a list containing the last even gap in `a` if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is an empty list, `gap` is the last even gap in `even` if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in `odd`. If the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, `ans` is increased by the sum of all odd gaps, and if `y` is less than half of the first even gap, `ans` is increased by 2 times the original value of `y`. If `y` is less than half of the last even gap, `y` is set to 0, `ans` is increased by `gap`, and `y` is decreased by half of `gap`, and the value of `ans` is printed. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, `ans` is increased by 1, and now `ans` is increased by 1. If `t1` is in `st` or `t2` is not in `st`, `ans` remains unchanged, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 1, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a list containing the last odd gap in a if the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list, even is a list containing the last even gap in a if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in odd, gap is the last even gap in even if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in odd. If the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, ans is increased by the sum of all odd gaps, and if y is less than half of the first even gap, ans is increased by 2 times the original value of y. If y is less than half of the last even gap, y is set to 0, ans is increased by gap, and y is decreased by half of gap, and the value of ans is printed. If t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, ans is increased by 1, and now ans is increased by 1. If t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, ans remains unchanged, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1. If the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, even is updated to include the last even gap in a. If the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, odd now contains the last even gap in even if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus 2 times the original value of `y` if `y` is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise `y` is less than half of the last odd gap, `_` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `st` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is a list containing the last odd gap in `a` if the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise it is an empty list, `even` is a list containing the last even gap in `a` if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in `odd`, `gap` is the last even gap in `even` if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in `odd`. If the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, `ans` is increased by the sum of all odd gaps, and if `y` is less than half of the first even gap, `ans` is increased by 2 times the original value of `y`. If `y` is less than half of the last even gap, `y` is set to 0, `ans` is increased by `gap`, and `y` is decreased by half of `gap`, and the value of `ans` is printed. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, `ans` is increased by 1, and now `ans` is increased by 1. If `t1` is in `st` or `t2` is not in `st`, `ans` remains unchanged, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, `even` is updated to include the last even gap in `a`. If the gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, `odd` now contains the last even gap in `even` if the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, otherwise it is the last odd gap in `odd`. If the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, `even` is updated to include the last even gap in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
