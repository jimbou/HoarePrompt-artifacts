Output State: **n is an integer, x is greater than 0, y is an integer decreased by half of the second even gap, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 2 elements, gap is the second even gap in even, ans is increased by the sum of the first even gap and the second even gap, and if y is less than half of the first even gap, ans is increased by 2 times the original value of y.**
