Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1`.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was previously equal to `x - 1` if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, otherwise `ans` was equal to `x - 2`, now `ans` is equal to `x` if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `x - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
