Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The rest of the input remains the same, containing `t` test cases, each with two lines of integers as described in the initial state.
