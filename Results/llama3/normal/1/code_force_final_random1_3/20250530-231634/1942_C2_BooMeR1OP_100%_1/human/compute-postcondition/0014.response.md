Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[2] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[2] + 2) % n`, `ans` is an integer equal to either `x + 1` or `x` depending on whether `t1` is in `st` and `t2` is in `st`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now either `x + 1` or `x`, depending on the conditions specified in the initial state.
