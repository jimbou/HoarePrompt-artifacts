Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `gap` is 0, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `st` is a set containing all elements of a. If the current value of t1 is not in st and the current value of t2 is in st, then `ans` is increased by 1.**
