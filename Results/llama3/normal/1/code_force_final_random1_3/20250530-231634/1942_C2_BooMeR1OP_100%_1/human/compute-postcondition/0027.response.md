State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[1 - 1] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[1 - 1] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to 0 - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to 1 - 1. If the gap between `next_elem` and `a[i]` is greater than 1 and is an odd number, then `odd` is a list containing one integer which is equal to gap, and `even` is an empty list. If the gap is greater than 0 and is an even number, then `odd` is an empty list, and `even` is a list containing one integer which is equal to (a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1) if i is not equal to x - 1, otherwise (a[0] + n - a[i] - 1).**
