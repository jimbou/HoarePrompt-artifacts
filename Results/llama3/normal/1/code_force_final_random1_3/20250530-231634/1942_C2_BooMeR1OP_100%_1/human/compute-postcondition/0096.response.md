Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in `a`. If the gap between consecutive elements in `a` is greater than 1 and odd, it is added to the `odd` list. If the gap is greater than 0 and even, it is added to the `even` list. `gap` is a positive integer equal to the difference between `next_elem` and `a[i]` minus 1, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `st` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`.***
