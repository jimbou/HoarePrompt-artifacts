Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1`, `st` is a set of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[0] + 2) % n`. The current value of `t1` is not in `st` and the current value of `t2` is in `st`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The set `st` still contains the same elements, and the current values of `t1` and `t2` are still not in `st` and in `st`, respectively. The input stream `stdin` still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
