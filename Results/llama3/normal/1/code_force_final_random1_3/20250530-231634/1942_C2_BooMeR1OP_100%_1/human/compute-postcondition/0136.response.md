To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `gap` and `even`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `even` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `even` has at least 2 elements, and `gap` is the second even gap in `even`. For the loop to execute again, `even` must have at least 3 elements, and `gap` must be the third even gap in `even`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an integer decreased by half of the second even gap, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, `i` is `x`, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus 2 times the original value of `y` if `y` is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise `y` is less than half of the last odd gap, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `st` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in `a` that must have at least 3 elements, `gap` is the third even gap in `even`, and `ans` is increased by the sum of the first even gap and the second even gap, and if `y` is less than half of the first even gap, `ans` is increased by 2 times the original value of `y`.**
