Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first gap, otherwise ans remains unchanged, odd is a sorted list containing all the odd gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 3 gaps, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the third gap in the list, ans is increased by the value of the third gap in the list, and y is the original value of y minus half of the third gap if y is less than half of the third gap, otherwise y remains unchanged.**
