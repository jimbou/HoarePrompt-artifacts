Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 1 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 1, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `gap` is 0, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `st` is a set containing all elements of a.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus 1, which is x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 1 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 1.
