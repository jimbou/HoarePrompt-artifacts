Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of x - 2, the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1, the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a, the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a, and 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, plus the sum of all even gaps, and if y is less than half of the first even gap, 2 times the original value of y, if y is less than half of the last even gap, gap and y decreased by half of gap)**
