Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, gap is 0, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1, st is a set containing all elements of a
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
    t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
    if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `gap` is 0, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `st` is a set containing all elements of a. If the current value of t1 is not in st and the current value of t2 is in st, then `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, x is greater than 1, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[i] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[i] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 1 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st then ans is increased by 1, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, gap is 0, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1, st is a set containing all elements of a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `x` is greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[i] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 1 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st then ans is increased by 1, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `gap` is 0, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `st` is a set containing all elements of a. If t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, then ans is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
