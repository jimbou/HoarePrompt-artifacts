Output State: **`n`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans` is increased by `gap` plus `gap // 2`, `_`, `t`, `st`, `next_elem`, `odd`, `even`, and `gap` are as described in the precondition, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`. If `y` is less than half of the second even gap, then `y` is set to 0 and `ans` is increased by twice the second even gap. Otherwise, no changes are made to these variables.**
