Postcondition: ***n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, odd is a sorted list containing all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 2 gaps, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, gap is the second gap in the list odd, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1. If y is less than half of the first even gap, y is set to 0. Otherwise, no change is made to y.***
