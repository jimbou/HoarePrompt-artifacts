Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[0 - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[0 - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to 0 - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to 0 - 1, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1, otherwise a[i + 1], and the current value of gap is an integer greater than 1 and is an odd number, specifically gap is equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1.**
