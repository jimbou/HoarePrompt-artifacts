Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, `gap` is a positive integer equal to the difference between next_elem and a[i] minus 1, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `st` is a set containing all elements of a, `next_elem` is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], `odd` is a list containing the gap.**

The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. The value of `gap` is a positive integer equal to the difference between `next_elem` and `a[i]` minus 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
