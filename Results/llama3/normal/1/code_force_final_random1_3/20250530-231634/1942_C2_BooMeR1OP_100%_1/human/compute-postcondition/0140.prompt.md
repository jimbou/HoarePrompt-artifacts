Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, x is greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a, y is either 0 or less than half of the last odd gap.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, x is greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 1 element, gap is the first even gap in even, ans is increased by gap, y is decreased by half of gap.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, x is greater than 0, y is an integer decreased by half of the second even gap, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 2 elements, gap is the second even gap in even, ans is increased by the sum of the first even gap and the second even gap, and if y is less than half of the first even gap, ans is increased by 2 times the original value of y.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, x is greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i from 0 to x - 1 plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in a plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in a plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise y is less than half of the last odd gap, _ is 1, t is an integer greater than 1, st is a set containing all elements of a, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing all even gaps between consecutive elements in a that must have at least 3 elements, gap is the third even gap in even, and ans is increased by the sum of the first even gap and the second even gap, and if y is less than half of the first even gap, ans is increased by 2 times the original value of y. If y is less than half of the third even gap, y is set to 0, ans is increased by gap, and y is decreased by half of gap.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
