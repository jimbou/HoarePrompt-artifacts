To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need to be explicitly mentioned in the state).

According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can adjust the state to reflect that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains at least 1 test case**
