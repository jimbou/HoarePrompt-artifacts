Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than its original value, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[0] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[0] + 2) % n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all even gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus the sum of all odd gaps between consecutive elements in `a` plus 2 times the original value of `y` if `y` is less than half of the first even gap, otherwise `y` is less than half of the last odd gap, `_` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `st` is a set containing all elements of `a`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `gap` is the last even gap in `even`, `ans` is increased by the sum of all even gaps, and if `y` is less than half of the first even gap, `ans` is increased by 2 times the original value of `y`. If `y` is less than half of the last even gap, `y` is set to 0, `ans` is increased by `gap`, and `y` is decreased by half of `gap`, and the value of `ans` is printed. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, `ans` is increased by 1.***
