Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `p` is a list of four even integers where each integer is either 0 or an even number between 2 and 200, and this is printed: a boolean value indicating whether all the first three elements of the list `p` are odd numbers (i.e., their remainder when divided by 2 is greater than 0), and the sum of all elements in the list `p` divided by 2, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to a list of four even integers, where each integer is either 0 or an even number between 2 and 200. This is because the `map` function applies the lambda function to each input integer, subtracting the remainder when divided by 2, effectively rounding down to the nearest even number. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
