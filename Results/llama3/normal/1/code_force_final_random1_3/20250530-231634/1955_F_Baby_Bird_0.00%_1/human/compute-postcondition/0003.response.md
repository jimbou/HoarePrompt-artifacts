Output: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `p` is a list of four integers where each integer is either 0 or 2 or an even number between 2 and 200, and this is printed: a boolean value indicating whether all the first three elements of the list `p` are odd numbers (i.e., their remainder when divided by 2 is greater than 0), and the sum of all elements in the list `p` divided by 2**
