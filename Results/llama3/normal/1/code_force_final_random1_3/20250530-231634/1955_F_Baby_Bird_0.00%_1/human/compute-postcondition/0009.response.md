Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-4` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `p` is a list of four even integers where each integer is either 0 or an even number between 2 and 200, `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, and the following is printed: False and the sum of all elements in the list `p` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` reads a line from `stdin`, splits it into four integers, and then applies a lambda function to each integer. The lambda function subtracts the remainder of the integer divided by 2 from the integer itself, effectively rounding down to the nearest even number. The resulting list of four even integers is assigned to `p`. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged, as well as the printed output. The only change is that `stdin` now contains `t-4` lines instead of `t-3`, since one line has been read.
