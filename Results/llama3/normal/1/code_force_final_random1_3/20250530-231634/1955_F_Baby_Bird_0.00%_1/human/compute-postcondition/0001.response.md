Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `p` is a list of four integers where each integer is either 0 or 2 or an even number between 2 and 200.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is decreased by 1 because one line of input is consumed by the `input()` function. The list `p` is created by mapping the input integers to their even counterparts, which means each integer in `p` is either 0 or 2 or an even number between 2 and 200.
