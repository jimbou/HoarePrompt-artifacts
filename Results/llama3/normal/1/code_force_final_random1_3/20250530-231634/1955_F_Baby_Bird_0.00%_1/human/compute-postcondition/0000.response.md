To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `_` (a throwaway variable, but we'll focus on the condition) and the `input()` function, which reads from `stdin`.

Given that `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` that must be at least 1, followed by `t` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200)**
