Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` is equal to `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then if `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, then if `m` is equal to `n - 1`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, then if both `m` and `n` are even numbers, or if either `m` or `n` is odd and the other is also odd, 'Yes' is printed. If either `m` or `n` is odd and the other is even, 'No' is printed.***
