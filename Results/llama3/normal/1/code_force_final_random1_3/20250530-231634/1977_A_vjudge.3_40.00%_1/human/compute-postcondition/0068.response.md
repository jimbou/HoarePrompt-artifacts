Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is `t-1`, stdin is empty. If `n` equals `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is one less than `n`, 'Yes' is printed. If both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains the same, `n` and `m` are still integers between 1 and 100, and `i` has reached its final value of `t-1`. The stdin is empty because all lines have been read. The conditions for printing 'Yes' or 'No' remain the same as in the previous iterations.
