Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers (1 <= n, m <= 100). If both `m` and `n` are even, 'Yes' is being printed. If both `m` and `n` are odd, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.***
