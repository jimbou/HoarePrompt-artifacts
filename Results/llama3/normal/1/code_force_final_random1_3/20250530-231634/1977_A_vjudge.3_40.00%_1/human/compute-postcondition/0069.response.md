Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t pairs of integers n and m. It then checks each pair and prints 'Yes' if n equals m, m is one less than n, or both n and m have the same parity (both even or both odd). Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function processes all t pairs and empties the standard input.**
