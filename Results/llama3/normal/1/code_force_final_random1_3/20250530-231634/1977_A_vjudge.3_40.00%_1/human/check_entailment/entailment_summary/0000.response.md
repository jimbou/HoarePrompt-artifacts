Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks the following conditions:

- If n equals m, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding 1 cube at a time.
- If m is one less than n, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding 1 cube at a time and then removing 1 cube.
- If both n and m have the same parity (both even or both odd), it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints 'Yes' if it's possible to build a tower with m cubes, and 'No' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
