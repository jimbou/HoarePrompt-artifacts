Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking various conditions based on the values of n and m. However, the conditions are not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios.

The program correctly handles the cases where n equals m, m is greater than n, and m is equal to n minus 1. It also correctly handles the cases where both m and n are even or both are odd.

However, the program does not correctly handle the cases where m is less than n and m is not equal to n minus 1. In such cases, the program does not provide a clear solution.

For example, consider the input (5, 3). The program will print 'No', but it is actually possible to build a tower with 3 cubes after 5 moves (add 3 cubes and then remove 2).

Therefore, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
