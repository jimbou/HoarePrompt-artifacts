Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), and `n` is not equal to `m`. The current value of `m` is greater than the current value of `n`, and 'No' is being printed**
