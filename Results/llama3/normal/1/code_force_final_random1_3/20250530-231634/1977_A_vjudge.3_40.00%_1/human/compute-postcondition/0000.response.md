The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) first, followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). After accepting the first integer `t` from the stdin, the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).**
