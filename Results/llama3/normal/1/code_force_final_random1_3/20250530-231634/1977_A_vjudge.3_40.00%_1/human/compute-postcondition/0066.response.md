Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is not greater than `n`, then if `m` is one less than `n`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is not one less than `n`, then if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. If either `m` or `n` is odd and the other is even, 'No' is printed.***
