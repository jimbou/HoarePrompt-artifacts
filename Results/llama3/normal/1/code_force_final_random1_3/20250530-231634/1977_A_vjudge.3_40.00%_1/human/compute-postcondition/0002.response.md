Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100)**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are now integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, as they were read from the input. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), as one line has been read and processed. The value of `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.
