Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers (1 <= n, m <= 100). If both `m` and `n` are odd, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.***
