Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` equals `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is one less than `n`, 'Yes' is printed. If both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
