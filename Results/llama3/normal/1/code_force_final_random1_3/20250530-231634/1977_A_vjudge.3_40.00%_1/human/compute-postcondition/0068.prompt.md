Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if n == m:
        print('Yes')
    elif m > n:
        print('No')
    elif m == n - 1:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` is equal to `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then if `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, then if `m` is equal to `n - 1`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, then if both `m` and `n` are even numbers, or if either `m` or `n` is odd and the other is also odd, 'Yes' is printed. If either `m` or `n` is odd and the other is even, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` equals `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is one less than `n`, 'Yes' is printed. If both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` is equal to `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then if `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is not greater than `n`, then if `m` is one less than `n`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is not one less than `n`, then if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. If either `m` or `n` is odd and the other is even, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
