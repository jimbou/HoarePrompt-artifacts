Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, he either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

- If n equals m, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time, so it prints 'Yes'.
- If m is greater than n, it's impossible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves, so it prints 'No'.
- If m is one less than n, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time and then removing one cube, so it prints 'Yes'.
- If both m and n are even or both are odd, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes because the parity of the number of cubes and the number of moves is the same, so it prints 'Yes'.
- In all other cases, it's impossible to build a tower with m cubes, so it prints 'No'.

The program correctly covers all possible cases and provides the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
