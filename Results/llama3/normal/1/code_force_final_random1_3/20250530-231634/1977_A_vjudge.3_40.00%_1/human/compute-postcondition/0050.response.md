Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the two integers read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers, because one line has been read and processed.
