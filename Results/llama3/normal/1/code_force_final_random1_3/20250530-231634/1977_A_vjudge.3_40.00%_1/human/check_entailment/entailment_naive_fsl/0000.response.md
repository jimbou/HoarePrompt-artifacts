Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines whether it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks the following cases:

- If n is equal to m, it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time.
- If m is greater than n, it's not possible to have a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If m is equal to n - 1, it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time and then removing one cube.
- If both m and n are even or both are odd, it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly. I couldn't find any case where the program doesn't work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
