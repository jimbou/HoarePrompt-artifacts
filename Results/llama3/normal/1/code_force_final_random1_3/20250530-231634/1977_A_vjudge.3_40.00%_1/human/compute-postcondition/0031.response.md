Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers (1 <= n, m <= 100)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the two integers read from the first line of the input, which are between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers, since one line has been read and processed.
