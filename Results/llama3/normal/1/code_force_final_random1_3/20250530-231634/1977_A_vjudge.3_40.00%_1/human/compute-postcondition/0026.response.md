Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), and `n` is not equal to `m`, and `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. If both `m` and `n` are even numbers, 'Yes' is printed. If either `m` or `n` is odd, and the other is also odd, 'Yes' is printed. If either `m` or `n` is odd, and the other is even, 'No' is printed.***
