Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `ar`.
2.  It initializes an array `res` of size `n` to store the result and a variable `mex` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
3.  The program then iterates over the input array `ar` in reverse order. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates the corresponding value in the permutation `p` as `mex - ar[i]` and stores it in `res[i]`.
4.  After calculating `res[i]`, the program updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum between its current value and `mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` constructed so far.
5.  Finally, the program prints the elements of `res` as the permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
