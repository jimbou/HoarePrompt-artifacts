Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case. The current value of `mex` is greater than or equal to the value of `mex - ar[i]`**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to be `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, which is the result of subtracting the value at index `i` of `ar` from the original value of `mex`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `mex` is greater than or equal to the value of `mex - ar[i]` is still valid.
