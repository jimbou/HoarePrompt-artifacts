Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 3]` is equal to `mex - ar[n - 3]` and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between the previous value of `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 3]`, `i` is `n - 3`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` at index `i` is updated to be equal to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is `n - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mex` is still the minimum value between its previous value and `mex - ar[n - 3]`. The input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case.
