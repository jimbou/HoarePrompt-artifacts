Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], mex is equal to 0, i is -n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state is such that the list `res` contains the differences between the initial value of `mex` (which is `n`) and each element in the list `ar`. The value of `mex` is updated in each iteration to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between its current value and the current element in `ar`. After all iterations, `mex` will be 0, and `i` will be -n, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The other variables, `n`, `ar`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
