Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It successfully constructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program uses a deque to efficiently keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p`. This is done by initializing `mex` to `n` and updating it whenever a smaller value is found.
2. The program iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order, which is crucial in constructing the permutation `p`. This is because the value of `mex` depends on the previous elements in `p`, and iterating in reverse order ensures that we have the correct `mex` value for each element.
3. For each element `ar[i]`, the program calculates the corresponding value in `p` as `mex - ar[i]`. This is based on the definition of `MEX` and the relationship between `a` and `p`.
4. The program updates the `mex` value whenever a smaller value is found, which ensures that we always have the correct `mex` value for the next element.
5. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p` as a space-separated string.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including edge cases where `n` is 1 or where the array `a` contains negative values. The use of a deque and the reverse iteration over the array `ar` are key to the program's correctness.

Overall, the program is well-structured, efficient, and correctly implements the required logic to construct a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.
