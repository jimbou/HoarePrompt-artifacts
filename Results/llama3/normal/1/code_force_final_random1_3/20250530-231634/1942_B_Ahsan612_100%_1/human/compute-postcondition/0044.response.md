Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 2]` is equal to `mex - ar[n - 2]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case.**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is `n - 2`. The values of `n`, `ar`, `mex`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The list `res` now has its `n - 2` index updated with the new value.
