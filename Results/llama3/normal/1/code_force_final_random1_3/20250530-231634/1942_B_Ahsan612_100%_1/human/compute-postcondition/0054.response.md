Output State: **The loop has finished executing, stdin is empty, and the output contains a string of space-separated values for each test case, where each value is mex - ar[i] and mex is equal to the minimum value between the initial value of mex and the minimum value of mex - ar[i] for all i.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the input has been fully processed. The output contains the results of the loop's execution for each test case, where each result is a string of space-separated values calculated based on the input values and the minimum value of mex.
