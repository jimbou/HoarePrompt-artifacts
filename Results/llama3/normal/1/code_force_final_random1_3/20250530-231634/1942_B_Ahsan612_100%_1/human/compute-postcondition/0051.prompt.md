Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], mex is equal to n, i is -n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case, and this is printed: A string of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], separated by a space.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    res[i] = mex - ar[i]
    if mex > mex - ar[i]:
        mex = mex - ar[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is equal to `n - ar[n - 1]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 1]`, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 2]` is equal to `mex - ar[n - 2]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between the previous value of `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case. The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between the previous value of `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 2]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 3]` is equal to `mex - ar[n - 3]` and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between the previous value of `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 3]`, `i` is `n - 3`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to the minimum value between the previous value of `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
