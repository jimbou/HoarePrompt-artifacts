The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. So for the loop to be executed  `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
