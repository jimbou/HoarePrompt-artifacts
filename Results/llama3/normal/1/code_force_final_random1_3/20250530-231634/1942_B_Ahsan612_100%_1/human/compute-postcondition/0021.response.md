Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `mex` is equal to `n` and `ar[i]` is the value at index `i` in the list `ar`. The rest of the values in the list `res` remain None. The values of `n`, `ar`, `mex`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.
