Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case. The current value of `mex` is greater than the value of `mex - ar[i]`***
