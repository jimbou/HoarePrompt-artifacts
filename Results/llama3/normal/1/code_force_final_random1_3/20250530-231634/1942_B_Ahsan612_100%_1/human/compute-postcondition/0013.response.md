Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the second last value is `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, the third last value is `mex - ar[len(ar)-3]`, and the rest are `None` except the last value which is `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mex` has been updated to be equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-3]`, which means it has been decremented by the value of the third last element in the list `ar`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.
