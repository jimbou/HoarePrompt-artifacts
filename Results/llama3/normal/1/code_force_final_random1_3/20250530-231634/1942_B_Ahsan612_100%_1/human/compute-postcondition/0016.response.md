The code prints a string of space-separated values, where each value is the difference between the mex (minimum excluded value) and the corresponding element in the list `ar`. The mex is initially set to 0.

Since `i` is -1, it means that the loop that calculates the mex has not started yet, and the mex is still 0. Therefore, each value in the `res` list will be the difference between 0 and the corresponding element in `ar`.

Output: **0 - ar[0], 0 - ar[1], ..., 0 - ar[n-1]**
