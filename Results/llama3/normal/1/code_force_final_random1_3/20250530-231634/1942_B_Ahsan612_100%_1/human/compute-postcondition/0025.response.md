The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and ar, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `len(ar) - 2`.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case. The current value of `mex` is greater than or equal to the value of `mex - ar[i]`.**
