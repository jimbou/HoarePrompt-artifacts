To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0` in reverse order, decrementing `i` by `1` each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by `1`, so `i` becomes `len(ar) - 3`.

The other objects in the loop head are `len(ar) - 1` and `-1`, which are not variables and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which becomes `len(ar) - 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[len(ar) - 3]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, and the value at index `i` in `res` is now assigned the value `mex - ar[i]`.**
