The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `len(ar) - 2`.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where the second last value is mex - ar[i] and the rest are None, mex is equal to mex - ar[i], i is len(ar) - 2. The current value of mex is less than or equal to the difference between the original value of mex and the last element of ar.**
