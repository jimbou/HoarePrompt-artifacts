Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of n integers, `res` is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], `mex` is equal to the minimum value between the initial value of `mex` and the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all i, `i` is -1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `res` contains the minimum value between the initial value of `mex` and the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all i, and the variable `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between the initial value of `mex` and the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all i. The variable `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
