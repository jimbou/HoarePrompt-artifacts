Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is None, mex is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    res[i] = mex - ar[i]
    if mex > mex - ar[i]:
        mex = mex - ar[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case. The current value of `mex` is greater than or equal to the value of `mex - ar[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, and the value at index `i` in `res` is now assigned the value `mex - ar[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
