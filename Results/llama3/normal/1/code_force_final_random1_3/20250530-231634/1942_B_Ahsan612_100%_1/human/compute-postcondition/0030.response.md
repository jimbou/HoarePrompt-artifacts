Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[len(ar) - 3]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.**

In this output state, the value at index `i` in `res` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`. The value of `mex` is determined based on the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]`. If this condition is true, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, otherwise it is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`. The rest of the values in `res` remain the same. The values of `n`, `ar`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
