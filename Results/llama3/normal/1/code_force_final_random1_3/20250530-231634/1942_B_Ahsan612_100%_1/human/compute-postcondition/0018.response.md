To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the state) and the `range` object created by `int(input())`.
2. The state of the `range` object depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases.
3. Since the loop has already executed once, the number of test cases has been reduced by 1.
4. Therefore, the state of the `range` object should be adjusted to reflect that there is one fewer test case remaining.

Considering the above points, the adjusted state is:

State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i] and mex is equal to 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 lines per test case, and the list of values in res is printed where each value is mex - ar[i] and mex is equal to 0.**

Note that the states of `n`, `ar`, `res`, `i`, and the printed list remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the loop head. Only the state of the `stdin` is adjusted to reflect that one more test case has been processed.
