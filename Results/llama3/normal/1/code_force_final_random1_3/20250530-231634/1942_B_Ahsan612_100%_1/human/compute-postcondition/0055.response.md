Functionality: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then calculates and prints a list of values for each test case, where each value is the difference between the minimum value of the list and the corresponding element in the list, updated iteratively from right to left. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, leaving the standard input empty and the output containing the calculated values for each test case.
