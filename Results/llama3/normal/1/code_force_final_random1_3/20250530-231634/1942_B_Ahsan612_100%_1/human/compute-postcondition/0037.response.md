Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], mex is equal to n, i is -n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case, and this is printed: A string of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], separated by a space.**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now a specific integer greater than 0. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `ar`. The list `res` is initialized with `n` values of `None`. The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `n`. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `-n`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case. Finally, a string of `n` values where each value is `mex - ar[i]`, separated by a space, is printed.
