Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last value is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1**.

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `mex` is equal to `n` and `i` is the last index of the list `ar`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
