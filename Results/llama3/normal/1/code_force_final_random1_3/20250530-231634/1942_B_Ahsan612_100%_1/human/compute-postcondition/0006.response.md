Postcondition: ***stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where the last value is mex - ar[i] and the rest are None, mex is equal to mex - ar[i], i is len(ar) - 1. The current value of mex is less than or equal to the difference between the original value of mex and the last element of ar.***
