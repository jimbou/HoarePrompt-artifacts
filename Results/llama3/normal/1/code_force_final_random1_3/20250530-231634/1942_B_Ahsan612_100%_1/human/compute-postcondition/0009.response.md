Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the second last value is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `None` except the last value which is `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to be equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, which means it has been decremented by the value of the second last element in the list `ar`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.
