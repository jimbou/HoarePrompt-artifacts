To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `ar` has at least one element. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0 and `ar` is a list of `n` integers, we can conclude that `ar` has at least one element.

Before the loop starts, `i` is -1, which is not a valid index for `ar`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `i` to be a valid index for `ar`. Since the loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`, we can set `i` to `len(ar) - 1` to ensure the loop can execute.

The other variables, `n`, `res`, `mex`, and `stdin`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where each value is None, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case**
