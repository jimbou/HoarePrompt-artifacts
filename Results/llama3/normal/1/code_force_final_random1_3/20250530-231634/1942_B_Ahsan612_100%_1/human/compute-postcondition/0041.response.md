Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is equal to `n - ar[n - 1]`, `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[n - 1]`, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case. The current value of `mex` is less than or equal to `n - ar[n - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to be equal to `mex - ar[n - 1]`, which is less than or equal to `n - ar[n - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case.
