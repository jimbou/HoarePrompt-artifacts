Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, and the value at index `i` in `res` is now assigned the value `mex - ar[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` at index `i` is now calculated and assigned, which is equal to `mex - ar[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case. The value of `mex` is still equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `i` is still `len(ar) - 2`.
