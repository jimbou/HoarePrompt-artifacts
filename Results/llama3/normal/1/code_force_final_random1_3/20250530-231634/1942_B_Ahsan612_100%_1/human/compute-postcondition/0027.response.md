Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, and the value at index `i` in `res` is now assigned the value `mex - ar[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mex` has been updated by subtracting the value at index `i` of `ar` from it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value at index `i` in `res` is still assigned the value `mex - ar[i]`, but now `mex` has a new value. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, minus 2 lines per test case.
