Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is equal to `n - ar[n - 1]`, `mex` is equal to n, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case**

In this output state, the value of `res[n - 1]` has been updated to `n - ar[n - 1]`, which means the last element of the `res` list is now equal to the difference between `n` and the last element of the `ar` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
