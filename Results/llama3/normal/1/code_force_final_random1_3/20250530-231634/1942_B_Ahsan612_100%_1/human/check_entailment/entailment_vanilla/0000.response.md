Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a deque from the `collections` module, but it is not actually used in the code. Instead, the program uses a simple iterative approach to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an array `res` of length `n` to store the permutation, and a variable `mex` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
4. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a_i`, it calculates the corresponding element `p_i` in the permutation using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`.
5. It then updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
6. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `res`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given input. However, there is a small issue with the program. The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the permutation. However, the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation should be initialized to 0, not `n`. This is because the permutation can contain any non-negative integer from 0 to `n-1`.

To fix this issue, the initialization of `mex` should be changed to `mex = 0`.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect initialization of `mex`)
