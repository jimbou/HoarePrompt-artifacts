The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, which is greater than or equal to -1 (since `n` is an integer greater than 1). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1 (due to the `-1` step in the `range` function). Therefore, `i` should be `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 3]` is equal to `mex - ar[n - 3]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between the previous value of `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 3]`, `i` is `n - 3`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case.**
