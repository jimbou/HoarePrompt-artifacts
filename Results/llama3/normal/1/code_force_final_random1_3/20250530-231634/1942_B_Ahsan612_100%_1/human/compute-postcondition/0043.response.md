The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and list `ar`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `ar`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `n - 2` and `n` must be greater than 1 and `ar` must be a list of at least 2 integers.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 2]` is equal to `n - 2 - ar[n - 2]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case.**
