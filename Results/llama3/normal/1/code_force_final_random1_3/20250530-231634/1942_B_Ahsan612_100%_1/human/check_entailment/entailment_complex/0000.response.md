Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, where `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

The program uses a deque from the `collections` module to efficiently calculate the `MEX` value. It iterates over the input array `ar` in reverse order, calculating the `res` array values as `mex - ar[i]`. The `mex` value is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and the minimum of the differences between `mex` and each `ar[i]`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for each test case. The use of a deque is not necessary in this case, as a simple variable `mex` can be used to keep track of the minimum value. However, the program's structure and logic are sound.

Correctness: **True**
