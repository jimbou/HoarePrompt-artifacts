Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n None values, mex is equal to n**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, reducing the number of lines in stdin by 1. The second line reads `n` integers from stdin, assigns them to `ar`, and reduces the number of lines in stdin by 1. The third line creates a list `res` of `n` None values. The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to `mex`. No other variables are affected.
