Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last value is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1. The current value of `mex` is greater than the difference between `mex` and the last element of `ar`***
