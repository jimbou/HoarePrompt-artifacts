To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0` in reverse order, decrementing `i` by `1` each time.

Given the current state:

* `n` is an integer greater than `0`
* `ar` is a list of `n` integers
* `res` is a list of `n` values where the second last value is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `None` except the last value which is `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`
* `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`
* `i` is `len(ar) - 2`
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head variables `i` and `ar`. Since `i` is currently `len(ar) - 2`, we need to decrement it by `1` to get the next value. Therefore, `i` should be `len(ar) - 3`.

The state of `ar` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The state of `res` and `mex` is not directly affected by the loop head, so we cannot make any changes to these variables based on the loop head alone.

The state of `stdin` is not relevant to the loop head, so we cannot make any changes to it.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the second last value is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `None` except the last value which is `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case**

Note that we cannot update the value of `mex` or `res` based on the loop head alone, as their values depend on the loop body, which is not provided.
