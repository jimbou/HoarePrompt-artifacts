Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i] and mex is equal to 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `res` will contain the differences between the original value of `mex` and each element in the list `ar`, and the value of `mex` will be 0. The loop will have iterated over the entire list `ar` in reverse order, updating the values in `res` and `mex` accordingly. The other variables, `n` and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
