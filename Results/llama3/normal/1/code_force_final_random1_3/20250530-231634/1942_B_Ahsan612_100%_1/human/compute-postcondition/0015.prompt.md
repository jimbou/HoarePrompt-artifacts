Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n None values, mex is equal to n
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    res[i] = mex - ar[i]
    if mex > mex - ar[i]:
        mex = mex - ar[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where the last value is mex - ar[i] and the rest are None, mex is equal to mex - ar[i], i is len(ar) - 1. The current value of mex is less than or equal to the difference between the original value of mex and the last element of ar.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the second last value is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `None` except the last value which is `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the second last value is `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, the third last value is `mex - ar[len(ar)-3]`, and the rest are `None` except the last value which is `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-3]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
