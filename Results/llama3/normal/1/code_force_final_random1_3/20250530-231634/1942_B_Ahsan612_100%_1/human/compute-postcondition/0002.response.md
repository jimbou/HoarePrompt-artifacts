To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `ar`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `ar` has at least one element. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0 and `ar` is a list of `n` integers, we can conclude that `ar` has at least one element.

To make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be within the valid range of indices for `ar`. Since the loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`, we can set `i` to be `len(ar) - 1` to ensure the loop executes.

The other variables, `stdin`, `n`, `res`, and `mex`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` None values, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1**
