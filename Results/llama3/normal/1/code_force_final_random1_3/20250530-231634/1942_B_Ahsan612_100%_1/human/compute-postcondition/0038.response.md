To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `ar`, and the implicit `len(ar)`.

Since `i` is initialized to `len(ar) - 1` and the loop iterates backwards to `-1`, we can infer that `len(ar)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. This means `ar` must have at least one element.

Additionally, since `i` is initialized to `len(ar) - 1`, we can set `i` to `n - 1` (since `n` is the length of `ar`).

The other states, such as `n`, `res`, `mex`, and `stdin`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values, `mex` is equal to n, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case**
