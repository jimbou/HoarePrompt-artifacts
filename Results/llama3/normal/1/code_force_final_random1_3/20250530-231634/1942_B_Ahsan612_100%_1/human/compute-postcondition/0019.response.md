The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `ar`. The third line creates a list of `n` values, all initialized to `None`, and assigns it to `res`. The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to `mex`.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is None, mex is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.**
