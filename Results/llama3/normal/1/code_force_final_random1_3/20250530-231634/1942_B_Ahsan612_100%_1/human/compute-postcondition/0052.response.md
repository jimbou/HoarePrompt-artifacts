The code prints a string of space-separated integers, where each integer is the difference between the minimum value between the initial value of `mex` and the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all i, and the corresponding element in the list `ar`.

Since the exact values of `mex` and `ar` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the differences. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a list of differences between `mex` and each element in `ar`.

Output: **[mex - ar[0], mex - ar[1], ..., mex - ar[n-1]] (where mex is the minimum value between the initial value of mex and the minimum value of mex - ar[i] for all i, and ar is the list of n integers)**
