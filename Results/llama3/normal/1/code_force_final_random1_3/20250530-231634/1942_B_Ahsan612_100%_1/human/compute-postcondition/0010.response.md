Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the second last value is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `None` except the last value which is `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar)-2]`.***
