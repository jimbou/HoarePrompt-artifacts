Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last value is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1. The current value of `mex` is less than or equal to the difference between the original value of `mex` and the last element of `ar`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mex` has been updated to be the difference between its original value and the last element of the list `ar`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `mex` is now less than or equal to the difference between its original value and the last element of `ar`.
