Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `ar` is a list of at least 2 integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 2]` is equal to `mex - ar[n - 2]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between the previous value of `mex` and `mex - ar[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mex` has been updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and the difference between its previous value and the element at index `n - 2` in the list `ar`. The other variables remain unchanged.
