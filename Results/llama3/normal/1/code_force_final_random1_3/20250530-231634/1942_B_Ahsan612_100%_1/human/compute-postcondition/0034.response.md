The code prints a string of space-separated values, where each value is the difference between the minimum excluded value (mex) and the corresponding element in the list `ar`. Since `mex` is equal to 0, each value in the output will be the negation of the corresponding element in `ar`.

Output: **-ar[0] -ar[1] ... -ar[n-1] (where -ar[i] is the negation of the i-th element in the list ar)**
