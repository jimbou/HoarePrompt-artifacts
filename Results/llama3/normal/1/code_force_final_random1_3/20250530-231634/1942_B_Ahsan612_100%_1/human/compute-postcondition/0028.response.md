Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case, and the value at index `i` in `res` is now assigned the value `mex - ar[i]`.***
