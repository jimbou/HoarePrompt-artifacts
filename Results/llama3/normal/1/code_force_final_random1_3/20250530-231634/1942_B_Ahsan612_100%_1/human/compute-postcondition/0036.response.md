The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], mex is equal to 0, i is -n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 lines per test case, and this is printed: A string of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], separated by a space.**
