Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the value of `mex` updated to be `mex - ar[i]`. The value of `mex` is now dependent on the value of `ar[i]`, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` remains the same, with multiple test cases minus 2 lines per test case.
