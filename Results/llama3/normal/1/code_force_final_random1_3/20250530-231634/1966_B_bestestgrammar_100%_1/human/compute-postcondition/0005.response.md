The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing one string, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', m is an integer**
