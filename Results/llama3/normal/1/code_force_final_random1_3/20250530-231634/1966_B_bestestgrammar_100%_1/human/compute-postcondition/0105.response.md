Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is 0, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the current value of the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the second character of the last string in `gr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `impossible` is now False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `gr` still contains `n` strings, and the indices `i` and `j` are still `n-1` and 0, respectively. The number of test cases in stdin is still `t-4-n`. The conditions regarding the characters of the strings in `gr` are still valid.
