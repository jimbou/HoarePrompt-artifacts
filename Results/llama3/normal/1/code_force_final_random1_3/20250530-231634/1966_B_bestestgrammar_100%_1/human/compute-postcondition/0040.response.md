Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, ans is 'NO', and the current value of impossible is True**

In this output state, the value of ans has been updated to 'NO', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the properties of gr, n, and impossible are still valid.
