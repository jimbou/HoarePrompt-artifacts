Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False.**

The code sets the value of `impossible` to False, regardless of the previous condition. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `impossible` is now definitely False. The other variables remain unchanged.
