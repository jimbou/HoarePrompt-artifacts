Based on the precondition, the value of `ans` depends on the condition `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`. If this condition is true, `ans` is 'NO', otherwise `ans` is 'YES'.

Since the exact values of `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where 'YES' is printed if gr[0][0] is equal to gr[n - 1][m - 1], otherwise 'NO' is printed)**
