Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is 'YES'**

In natural language, the code sets the value of `ans` to 'YES', while the rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list `gr` still contains `n` strings of length `m`, and the variable `i` is still equal to `n-1`. The rest of the variables and conditions, including the contents of `stdin`, remain the same.
