The `print(ans)` statement will print either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition that checks the first character of the first string in the list `gr` and the last character of the last string in the list `gr`.

Since the exact strings in the list `gr` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the condition, the output will be 'YES' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and 'NO' otherwise.

Output: **YES if the first character of the first string in gr is equal to the last character of the last string in gr, otherwise NO**
