Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 1, `impossible` is False, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `n` is at least 3**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `impossible` which is set to False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
