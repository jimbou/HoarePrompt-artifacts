State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False. If the first character of the string at index 1 in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the string at index 2 in `gr`, or the last character of the string at index 1 in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the string at index 2 in `gr`, then `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.**
