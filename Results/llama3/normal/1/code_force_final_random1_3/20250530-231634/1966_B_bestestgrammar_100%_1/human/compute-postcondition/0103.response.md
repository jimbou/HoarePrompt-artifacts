To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 2, because the range function will generate at least one value (0) when `m` is 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `m` to be at least 2.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is 0, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.**
