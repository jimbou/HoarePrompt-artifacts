Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is 2. If the first or last string in `gr` has different characters at index `j` and `j+1`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
