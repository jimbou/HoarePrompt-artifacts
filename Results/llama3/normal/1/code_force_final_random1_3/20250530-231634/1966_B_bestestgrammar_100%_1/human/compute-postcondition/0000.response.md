Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The remaining input in stdin still contains the t test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'.
