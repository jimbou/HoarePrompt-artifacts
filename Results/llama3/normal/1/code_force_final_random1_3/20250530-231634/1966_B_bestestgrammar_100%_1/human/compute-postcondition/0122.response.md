To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The other variables in the loop head are `n`, which remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False (if the first character of the string at index 0 in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the string at index 1 in `gr`, or the last character of the string at index 0 in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the string at index 1 in `gr`)**
