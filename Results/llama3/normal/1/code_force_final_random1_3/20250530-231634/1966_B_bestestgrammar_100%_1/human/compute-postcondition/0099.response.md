Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is either 'YES' or 'NO', stdin contains t-4-n test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `gr` will contain a list of `n` strings, where `n` is the number of iterations of the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
