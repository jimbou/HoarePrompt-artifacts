To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(m - 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is at least 0, and `m` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes at least 1. Since `m` is at least 3, the condition `j < m - 1` is still true, and the loop can execute again.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `tc`, `gr`, `i`, `stdin`, `n`, `ans`, and `impossible`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is at least 3, ans is 'YES', j is at least 1. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then impossible is False. Otherwise, impossible is True.**
