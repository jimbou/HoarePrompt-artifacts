Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining if it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program reads the input, checks the conditions for making all squares the same color, and prints the result.

The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right squares are of the same color. If they are not, it then checks if there are any adjacent squares of different colors in the first and last rows, or in the first and last columns. If there are no such adjacent squares, it means that it's impossible to make all squares the same color, and the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all the possible cases. It correctly identifies the conditions under which it's possible or impossible to make all squares the same color.

Correctness: **True**
