Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing one string, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer that must be greater than 0, m is an integer**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to contain one string, which is the first line of the input. The value of `stdin` has also been updated to contain t-2 test cases, since one test case has been read. The values of `t`, `tc`, and `i` remain unchanged.
