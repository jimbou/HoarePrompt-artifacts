Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains two strings of length m, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n-1 strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to contain two strings of length `m`, as a new string has been appended to it from the input. The number of test cases in stdin has also been updated to `t-5`, as one test case has been processed. The other variables remain unchanged.
