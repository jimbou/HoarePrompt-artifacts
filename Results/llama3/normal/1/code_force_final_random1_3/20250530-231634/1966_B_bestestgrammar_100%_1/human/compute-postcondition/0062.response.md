The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 and `m` must be greater than `j + 1`. So `j` is at least 0 and `m` is at least 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is at least 3, ans is 'YES', impossible is False if the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`. Otherwise, impossible is True, j is at least 0**
