Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `impossible` is True, `n` is at least 2. The current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.**
