Output State: `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `gr` will contain `n` strings of length `m`, and the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
