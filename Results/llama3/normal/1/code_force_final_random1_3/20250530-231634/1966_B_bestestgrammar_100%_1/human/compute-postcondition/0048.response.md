Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains one string of length m, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n-1 strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has changed to contain one string of length `m`, which is the first string of the current test case. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
