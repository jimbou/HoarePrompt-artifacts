Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` strings of length `m`, each containing only 'W' and 'B', `n` is an integer, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `impossible` is False, `j` is 0. The current value of `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been updated to False, while all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
