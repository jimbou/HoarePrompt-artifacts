To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `m` remains the same, but since `j` is now 2, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is 2**
