Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `n` is at least 3. `impossible` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been updated to False, while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3-n test cases, and `n` is at least 3 is still valid.
