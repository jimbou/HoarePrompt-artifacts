To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is `n-1` before the loop starts, we need to adjust `i` to be 0 (the starting value of the range) and `n` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', stdin contains t-4-n test cases**
