Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`. The variable `impossible` has been set to False, indicating that at least one pair of adjacent strings in the list `gr` has different first or last characters. The other variables remain unchanged.
