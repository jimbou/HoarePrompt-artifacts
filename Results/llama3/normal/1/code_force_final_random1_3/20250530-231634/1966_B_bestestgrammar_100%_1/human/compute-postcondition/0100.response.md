Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is 'YES', stdin contains t-4-n test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 'YES', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, and `m` is an integer still holds true. Additionally, the stdin still contains `t-4-n` test cases.
