Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `impossible` is set to False, regardless of its previous value. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same. The list `gr` still contains `n` strings. The values of `t`, `tc`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `j`, and `ans` are unchanged.
