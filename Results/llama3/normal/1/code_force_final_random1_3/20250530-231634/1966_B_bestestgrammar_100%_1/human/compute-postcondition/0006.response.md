Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', m is an integer**

In this output state, the list `gr` now contains two strings, where the second string is the input string from the stdin. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin now contains t-3 test cases, each with two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'.
