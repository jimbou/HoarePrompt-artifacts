Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `n` is at least 2. If the first character of the current string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the next string in `gr` or the last character of the current string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the next string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
