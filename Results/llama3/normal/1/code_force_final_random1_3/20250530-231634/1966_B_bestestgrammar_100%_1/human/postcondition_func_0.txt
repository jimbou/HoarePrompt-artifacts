The function reads a number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) followed by n strings of length m containing only 'W' and 'B'. It then checks if it's possible to transform the first string into the last string by changing one character at a time, with the constraint that the first and last characters of each string must be the same. If it's possible, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for each test case.
