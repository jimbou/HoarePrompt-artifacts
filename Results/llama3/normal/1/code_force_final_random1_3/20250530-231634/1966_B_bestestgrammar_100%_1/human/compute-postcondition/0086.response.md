Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer. If the first or last character of any two consecutive strings in `gr` are the same, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is not 'NO'.***
