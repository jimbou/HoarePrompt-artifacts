Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right squares are the same color. If they are not, it checks if there is a row or column where two adjacent squares are different colors. If such a row or column exists, it means that it is impossible to make all squares the same color, because there is no way to change the color of the squares in that row or column without changing the color of the top-left or bottom-right square.

If the top-left and bottom-right squares are the same color, or if there is no row or column with two adjacent squares of different colors, the program prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to make all squares the same color.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct answer for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
