Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer. `impossible` is True, regardless of the values of the first and last characters of the strings in `gr`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `n` is at least 2. If the first character of the current string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the next string in `gr` or the last character of the current string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the next string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `n` is at least 3. If the first or last character of the strings at index `i` and `i+1` in `gr` are different, then `impossible` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `n` is at least 3. If the first or last character of the strings at index `i` and `i+1` in `gr` are different, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
