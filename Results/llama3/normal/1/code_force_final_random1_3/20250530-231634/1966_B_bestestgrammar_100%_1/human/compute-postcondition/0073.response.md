According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer. `impossible` is True, regardless of the values of the first and last characters of the strings in `gr`. But these do not ensure that the loop will execute , so they need to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `impossible` is True, `n` is at least 2**
