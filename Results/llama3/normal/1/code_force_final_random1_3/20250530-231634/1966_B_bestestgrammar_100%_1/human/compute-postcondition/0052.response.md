Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains three strings of length m, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, stdin contains t-6 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n-1 strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has changed to contain three strings of length `m` because a new string has been appended to it from the input. The stdin now contains `t-6` test cases because one test case has been consumed to append the new string to `gr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
