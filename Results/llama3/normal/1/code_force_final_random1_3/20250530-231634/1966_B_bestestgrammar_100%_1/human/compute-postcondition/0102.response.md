Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases. The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.**

In this output state, a new variable `impossible` has been introduced and assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-4-n` test cases, and the condition that the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` still holds.
