Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, ans is 'NO', impossible is False.**

In this output state, the value of impossible has been changed to False. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. Each test case still contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'. The first character of the first string in gr is still not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, and ans is still 'NO'.
