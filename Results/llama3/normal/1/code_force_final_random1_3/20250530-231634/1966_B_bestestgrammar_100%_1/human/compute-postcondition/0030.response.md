Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, ans is 'NO', and impossible is False. The current value of i is such that the first character of the string at index i in gr is not equal to the first character of the string at index i+1 in gr, or the last character of the string at index i in gr is not equal to the last character of the string at index i+1 in gr.**

In this output state, the value of the variable "impossible" has been updated to False. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
