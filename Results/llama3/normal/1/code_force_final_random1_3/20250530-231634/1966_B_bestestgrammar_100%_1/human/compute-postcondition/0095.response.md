The code appends a new string to the list `gr` by accepting an input from stdin. Since `gr` initially contains one string, it will now contain two strings. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains t-6-n test cases because one test case has been consumed by the input.

Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', stdin contains t-6-n test cases**
