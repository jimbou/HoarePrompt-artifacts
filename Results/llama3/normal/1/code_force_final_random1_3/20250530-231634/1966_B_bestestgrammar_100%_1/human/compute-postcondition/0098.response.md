Output State: `t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', stdin contains t-4-n test cases.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `gr` will contain `n` strings, where `n` is the number of iterations. The variable `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The other variables remain unchanged.
