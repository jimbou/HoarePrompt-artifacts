Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` strings of length `m`, each containing only 'W' and 'B', `n` is an integer, `m` must be at least 4, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr` or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False and `j` is `m`. Otherwise, `impossible` is False, and `impossible` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `impossible` is now False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
