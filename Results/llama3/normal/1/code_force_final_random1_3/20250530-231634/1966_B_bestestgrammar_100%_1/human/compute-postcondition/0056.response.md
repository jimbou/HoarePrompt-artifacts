Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is 'YES'. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`***
