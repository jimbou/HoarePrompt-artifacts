Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing one string, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', stdin contains t-5-n test cases**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to contain one string, which is the input accepted from the stdin. The stdin now contains t-5-n test cases, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
