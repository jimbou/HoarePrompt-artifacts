Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, gr is an empty list, i is n-1, stdin contains t-4-n test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is either 'YES' or 'NO'.**

The code reads two integers n and m from stdin, which are assigned to the variables n and m respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The variable gr is initialized as an empty list. The values of t, tc, and i remain unchanged. The value of ans is determined based on the condition that if the first or last character of any two consecutive strings in gr are the same, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES'. Since gr is empty, ans is 'YES'.
