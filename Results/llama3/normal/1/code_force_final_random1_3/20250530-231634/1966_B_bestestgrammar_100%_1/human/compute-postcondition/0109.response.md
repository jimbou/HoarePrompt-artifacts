Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is 1. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.***
