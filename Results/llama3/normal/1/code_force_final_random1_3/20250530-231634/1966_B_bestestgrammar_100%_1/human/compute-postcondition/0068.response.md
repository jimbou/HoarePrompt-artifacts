Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is 'YES', impossible is False if the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. Otherwise, impossible is True.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the value of `j` has reached `m-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The value of `impossible` is determined based on whether the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If either of these conditions is true, `impossible` is False; otherwise, it remains True.
