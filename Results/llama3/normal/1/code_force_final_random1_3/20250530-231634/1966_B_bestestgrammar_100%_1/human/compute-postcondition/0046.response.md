Output State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, gr is an empty list, i is n-1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed**

The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`, respectively. It then creates an empty list `gr`. The value of `t` remains at least 2, `tc` remains 1, `i` remains `n-1`, and the remaining test cases in the standard input are reduced by 1. The value of `ans` is not affected by this code snippet, so its value remains the same as before, which is 'NO' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and 'YES' otherwise.
