The only variable in the loop head is variable tc, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t and tc. If tc is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 1, tc is 0. For the loop to execute again, tc must be increased by 1, so tc is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed**
