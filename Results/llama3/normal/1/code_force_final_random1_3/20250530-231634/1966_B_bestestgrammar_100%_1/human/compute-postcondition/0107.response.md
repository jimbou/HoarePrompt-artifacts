The only object in the loop head is variable  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and m. If j is less than m-1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0, m is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time j is 1 and m must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False if the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` is True. stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is 1, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.**
