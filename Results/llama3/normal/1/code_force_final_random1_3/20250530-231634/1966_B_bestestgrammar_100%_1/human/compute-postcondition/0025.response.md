Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, ans is 'NO', the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr. The current value of impossible is True.**

The code changes the value of `ans` from 'YES' to 'NO'. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, each with two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'. The list `gr` still contains n strings, and the index `i` is still n-1. The value of `impossible` is still True.
