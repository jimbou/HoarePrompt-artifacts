Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is at least 3, ans is 'YES', impossible is False, j is at least 0**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been updated to `False`, regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-3-n test cases. The strings in `gr` still have a length of m and contain only 'W' and 'B'. The value of `j` is still at least 0.
