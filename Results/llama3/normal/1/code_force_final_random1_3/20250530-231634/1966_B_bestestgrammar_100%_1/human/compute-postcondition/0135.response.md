Output State: **t is 0, tc is t, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed t times.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for all test cases (t times), and for each test case, it has processed all strings (i is n-1) and printed either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions. The input stream (stdin) is now empty (contains 0 test cases), and the variables n and m retain their last values from the last test case.
