Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list of `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, there are `t-4-n` test cases in stdin, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is True.
