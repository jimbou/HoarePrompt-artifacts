Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr. If impossible is True, then ans is 'NO' and impossible is True. Otherwise, ans is 'YES' and impossible is False.***
