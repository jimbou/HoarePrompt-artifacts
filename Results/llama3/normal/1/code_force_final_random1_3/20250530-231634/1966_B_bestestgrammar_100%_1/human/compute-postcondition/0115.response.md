Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is `m-1`**

The code changes the value of `ans` from 'YES' to 'NO'. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `t`, `tc`, `gr`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `impossible`, stdin, and `j` is still the same as in the initial state.
