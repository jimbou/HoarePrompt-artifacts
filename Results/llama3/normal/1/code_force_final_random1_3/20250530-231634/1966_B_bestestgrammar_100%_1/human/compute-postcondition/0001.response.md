The only variable in the loop head is `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `tc` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'.**
