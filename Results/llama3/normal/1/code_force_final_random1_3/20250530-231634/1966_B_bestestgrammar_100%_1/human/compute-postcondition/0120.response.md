Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False. The first character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the string at index `i+1` in `gr`, or the last character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the string at index `i+1` in `gr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list of `n` strings, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, there are `t-4-n` test cases in stdin, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is now False. The condition that the first character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the string at index `i+1` in `gr`, or the last character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the string at index `i+1` in `gr` still holds.
