Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is `m-1`, `ans` is 'NO'. If `impossible` is True, then the current state is maintained. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
