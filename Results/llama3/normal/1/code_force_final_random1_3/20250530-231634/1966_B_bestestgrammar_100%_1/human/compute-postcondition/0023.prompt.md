Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is 'YES', the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, and impossible is True.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m - 1):
    if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
        impossible = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` strings of length `m`, each containing only 'W' and 'B', `n` is an integer, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr` or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False and `j` is 0. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` strings of length `m`, each containing only 'W' and 'B', `n` is an integer, `m` must be at least 3, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr` or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False and `j` is `m-1`. Otherwise, `impossible` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m must be at least 4, ans is 'YES', the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr. If the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the second character of the first string in gr or the first character of the last string in gr is not equal to the second character of the last string in gr, then impossible is False and j is m. Otherwise, impossible is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
