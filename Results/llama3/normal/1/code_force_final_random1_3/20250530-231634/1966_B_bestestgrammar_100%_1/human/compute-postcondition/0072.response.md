Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer. `impossible` is True, regardless of the values of the first and last characters of the strings in `gr`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state, except that the variable `impossible` is now set to True, regardless of the values of the first and last characters of the strings in `gr`.
