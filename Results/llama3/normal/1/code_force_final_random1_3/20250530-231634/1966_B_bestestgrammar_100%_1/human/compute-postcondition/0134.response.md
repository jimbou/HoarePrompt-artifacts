Based on the precondition, we can determine the postcondition as follows:

The code prints the value of `ans`, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the first character of the first string in the list `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in the list `gr`.

Since `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `ans` is 'NO'.

Therefore, the postcondition is:

Output: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, n is an integer, m is an integer, stdin contains t-4-n test cases, and 'NO' is being printed**
