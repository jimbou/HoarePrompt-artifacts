Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer. If the first or last character of any two consecutive strings in `gr` are different, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has checked all consecutive pairs of strings in `gr`. If any pair of strings has different first or last characters, then `impossible` is set to False. If no such pair is found, then `impossible` remains True. The values of `t`, `tc`, `gr`, and stdin remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
