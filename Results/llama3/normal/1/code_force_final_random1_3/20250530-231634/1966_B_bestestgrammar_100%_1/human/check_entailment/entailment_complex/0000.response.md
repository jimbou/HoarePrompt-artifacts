Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have the same color. If they don't, it then checks if there is a row or column where the colors are different. If there is no such row or column, it means that it's impossible to make all squares the same color, so it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

This logic is correct because if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, and there is no row or column where the colors are different, then it's impossible to make all squares the same color. This is because any operation that changes the color of a square will also change the color of the top-left or bottom-right corner, which will always be different.

Correctness: **True**
