Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the first and last rows and columns have the same color, and if they don't, it checks if there are any adjacent squares with different colors in the first and last rows and columns. However, this is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
WBWB
WBWB
WBWB
WBWB
```

In this case, the program will output "YES" because the first and last rows and columns have the same color, and there are no adjacent squares with different colors in the first and last rows and columns. However, it is not possible to make all squares the same color in this grid, because there are alternating black and white squares in each row and column.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem, and its correctness is **False**.
