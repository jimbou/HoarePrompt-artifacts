Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing three strings, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', m is an integer**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to include a new string input from the user, which is appended to the existing list of two strings. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-4 test cases, each with two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', where m is an integer.
