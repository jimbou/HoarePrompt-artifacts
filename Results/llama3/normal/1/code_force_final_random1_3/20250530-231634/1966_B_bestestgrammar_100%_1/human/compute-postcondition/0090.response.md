The only variable in the loop head is variable  tc, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `tc`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be increased by 1, so `tc` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer. If the first or last character of any two consecutive strings in `gr` are the same, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES', and whether the first or last character of any two consecutive strings in `gr` are the same or not is printed, which is either 'YES' or 'NO'.**
