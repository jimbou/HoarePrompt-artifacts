Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is 'NO', the current value of impossible is True, meaning the first character of the first string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the first string in `gr`, and the first character of the last string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 'NO', while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `impossible` is still True, indicating that the first character of the first string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the first string in `gr`, and the first character of the last string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.
