The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined by the condition of the first or last character of any two consecutive strings in `gr` being the same.

Since `gr` contains n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', we can analyze the possible values of `ans` based on the condition.

If the first or last character of any two consecutive strings in `gr` are the same, then `ans` is 'NO'. This means that if there are any consecutive strings in `gr` that start or end with the same character, `ans` will be 'NO'.

On the other hand, if the first or last character of any two consecutive strings in `gr` are different, then `ans` is 'YES'. This means that if all consecutive strings in `gr` start and end with different characters, `ans` will be 'YES'.

Since the exact strings in `gr` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, based on the condition, we can conclude that `ans` will be either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the arrangement of the strings in `gr`.

Output: **YES or NO (depending on whether the first or last character of any two consecutive strings in gr are the same or different)**
