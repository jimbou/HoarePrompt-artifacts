To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since `i` is `n-1` before the loop starts, we can adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value for the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed**
