To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute again if `n` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `n` is at least 3. If the first or last character of the strings at index `i` and `i+1` in `gr` are different, then `impossible` is False.**
