Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, tc is 1, gr is an empty list, i is n-1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    gr.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains one string of length m, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n-1 strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains two strings of length m, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n-1 strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains three strings of length m, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, stdin contains t-6 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n-1 strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then ans is 'NO', otherwise ans is 'YES', and ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
