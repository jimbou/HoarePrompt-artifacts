Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is at least 3, ans is 'YES', j is at least 1, impossible is False.**

In this output state, the value of the variable `impossible` has been changed to False. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-3-n test cases, each with two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'. The conditions on n, m, ans, and j also remain the same.
