Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer. The first or last character of any two consecutive strings in `gr` are the same, and `impossible` is True, `ans` is 'NO'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is at least 2, the value of `tc` is 1, the list `gr` contains n strings of length m, the value of `i` is n-1, and the standard input contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B'. The first or last character of any two consecutive strings in `gr` are the same, and the variable `impossible` is True. Additionally, the variable `ans` is assigned the value 'NO'.
