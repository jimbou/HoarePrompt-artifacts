Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, ans is 'NO', impossible is False.**

In this output state, all the variables and conditions from the initial state remain the same, except for the variable "impossible", which is now set to False. This means that the condition that was previously True is now False, indicating that it is possible to satisfy the conditions.
