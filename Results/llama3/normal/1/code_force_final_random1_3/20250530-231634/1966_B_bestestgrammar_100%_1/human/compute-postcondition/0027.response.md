Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, ans is 'NO', and impossible is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains at least 1, the value of tc remains 0, the list gr still contains n strings, the value of i remains n-1, and the stdin still contains t-1 test cases. Each test case still contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', and n is still an integer. The first character of the first string in gr is still not equal to the last character of the last string in gr. However, the value of impossible has been set to True, and as a result, the value of ans has been set to 'NO'.
