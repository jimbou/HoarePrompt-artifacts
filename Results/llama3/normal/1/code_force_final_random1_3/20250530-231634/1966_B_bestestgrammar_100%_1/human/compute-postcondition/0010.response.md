Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is 'YES'**

The code assigns the string 'YES' to the variable ans. The values of the other variables are not affected. The variable ans now holds the value 'YES'.
