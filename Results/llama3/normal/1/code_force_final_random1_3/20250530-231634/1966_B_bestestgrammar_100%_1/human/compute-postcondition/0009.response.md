Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `gr` will contain `n` strings, where `n` is the number of strings in the current test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, with `t` still being at least 1, `tc` still being 0, and the input stream still containing `t-1` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` strings of length `m` containing only 'W' and 'B'.
