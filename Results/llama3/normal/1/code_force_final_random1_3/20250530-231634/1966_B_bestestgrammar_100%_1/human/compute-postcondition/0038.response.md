Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, ans is 'NO', and impossible is False.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable i has reached its final value of n-1, and the variable impossible has been set to False, indicating that at least one pair of adjacent strings in the list gr has different characters at the start or end. The other variables remain unchanged, with t still being at least 1, tc still being 0, gr still containing n strings, stdin still containing t-1 test cases, and ans still being 'NO'.
