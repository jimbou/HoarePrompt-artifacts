Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains `t-4-n` test cases, `j` is 1, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `impossible` is set to False, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same. The relationship between the first character of the first string and the last character of the last string in `gr` also remains the same.
