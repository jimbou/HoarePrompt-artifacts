Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is at least 2, ans is 'YES', impossible is False. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`, j is 0. Additionally, either the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`.**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been changed to `False`, while all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
