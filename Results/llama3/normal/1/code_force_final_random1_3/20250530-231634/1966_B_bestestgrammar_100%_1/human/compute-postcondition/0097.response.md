Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing three strings, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', stdin contains t-7-n test cases**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to a list containing three strings, as a new string input has been appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has also been updated to t-7-n, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
