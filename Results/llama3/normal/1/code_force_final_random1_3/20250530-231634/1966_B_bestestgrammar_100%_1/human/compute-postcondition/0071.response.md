Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the first string in `gr`, and the first character of the last string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, then ans is 'NO' and impossible is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
