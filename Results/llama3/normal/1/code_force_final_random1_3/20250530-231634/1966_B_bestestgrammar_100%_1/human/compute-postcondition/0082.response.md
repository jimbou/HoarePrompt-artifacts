Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `gr` contains n strings of length m, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3-n test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m, followed by n strings of length m, each containing only 'W' and 'B', n is an integer, m is an integer, `n` is at least 3. If the first or last character of the strings at index `i` and `i+1` in `gr` are different, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
