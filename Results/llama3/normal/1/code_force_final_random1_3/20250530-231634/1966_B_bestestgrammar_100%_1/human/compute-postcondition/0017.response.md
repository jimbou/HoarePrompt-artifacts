The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` must be `m-1` and `m` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` strings of length `m`, each containing only 'W' and 'B', `n` is an integer, `m` must be at least 3, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr` or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False and `j` is `m-1`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
