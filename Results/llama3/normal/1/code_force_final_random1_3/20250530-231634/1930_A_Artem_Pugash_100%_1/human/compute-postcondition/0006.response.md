To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the range `0` to `2 * n` with a step of `2`. This means that `i` is incremented by `2` at each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by `2`, making it `4`.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

The other variables, such as `l`, `score`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is increased by `l[0]` and `l[2]`, `i` is 4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0**
