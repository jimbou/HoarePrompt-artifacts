Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50, l is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, score is 0, i is not defined, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 50, which is assigned from the input. The list `l` contains 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, sorted in ascending order, also assigned from the input. The variable `score` is reset to 0. The variable `i` is not defined in the output state because it was not assigned a value in the given code snippet. The stdin now contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, because two test cases have been consumed by the input operations.
