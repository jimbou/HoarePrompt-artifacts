Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and then reads `2n` integers.
3.  The program sorts the integers in ascending order, which is a crucial step in finding the maximum final score.
4.  It then calculates the sum of the even-indexed elements (0-indexed) in the sorted list, which corresponds to the minimum values in each pair of integers.
5.  By adding these minimum values to the score, the program effectively simulates the process of choosing two integers, adding the minimum to the score, and erasing them from the whiteboard.
6.  Finally, the program prints the maximum final score for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases and terminates correctly.

Correctness: **True**
