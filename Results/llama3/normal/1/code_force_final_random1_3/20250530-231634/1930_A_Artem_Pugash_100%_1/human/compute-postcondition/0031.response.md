The code prints the value of `score`, which is the sum of all even-indexed elements in the sorted list `l`. Since `l` contains 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, the list `l` has a length of 2n, which is an even number.

The even-indexed elements in `l` are the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2. Since `l` is sorted, these elements are the smallest even-indexed elements in the list.

The sum of these elements is calculated and stored in the variable `score`. Therefore, the print statement will output the sum of the smallest even-indexed elements in the sorted list `l`.

Output: **the sum of the smallest even-indexed elements in the sorted list l**
