Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers on the whiteboard.
3. It sorts the integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It initializes a score variable to 0.
5. It iterates over the sorted integers in steps of 2, starting from the first integer (index 0). For each pair of integers, it adds the smaller integer (the one at the current index) to the score.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program works correctly because:

* By sorting the integers, it ensures that the smallest integer is always chosen first, which maximizes the score.
* By iterating over the sorted integers in steps of 2, it ensures that each pair of integers is considered exactly once.
* By adding the smaller integer of each pair to the score, it ensures that the maximum score is achieved.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles all possible inputs, including edge cases like `n=1` or `n=50`, and produces the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
