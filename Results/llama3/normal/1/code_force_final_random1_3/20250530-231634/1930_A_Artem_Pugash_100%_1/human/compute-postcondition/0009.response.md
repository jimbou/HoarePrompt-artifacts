The code prints the value of `score`, which is the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in the sorted list `l`. Since `l` contains 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, and `score` is increased by the sum of the odd-indexed smallest integers in `l`, the output will be the sum of n odd-indexed smallest integers in `l`.

Output: **the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in the sorted list l**
