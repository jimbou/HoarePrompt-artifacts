Output State: **The loop has finished executing, `t` test cases have been processed, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is the sum of all even-indexed elements in `l`, `i` is 2n, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 0, stdin is empty, and the sum of all even-indexed elements in `l` which is `score` has been printed for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, processing all `t` test cases. For each test case, the input `n` and the sorted list `l` of 2n integers have been processed, and the sum of all even-indexed elements in `l` (which is `score`) has been calculated and printed. The loop variables `i` and `2 * n` have reached their final values, and the input stream `stdin` is now empty.
