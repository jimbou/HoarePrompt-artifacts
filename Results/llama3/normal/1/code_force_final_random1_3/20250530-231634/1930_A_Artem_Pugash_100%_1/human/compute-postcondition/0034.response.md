Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, calculates the sum of the even-indexed elements, and prints this sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
