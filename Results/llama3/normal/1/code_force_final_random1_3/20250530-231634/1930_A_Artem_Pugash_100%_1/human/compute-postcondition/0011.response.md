The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stdin`. If `stdin` has at least t test cases the loop executes again for the t-th time. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` has t-1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `stdin` must have at least t test cases.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is increased by the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in `l`, `i` is 2n-2, stdin contains t test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0, and score (which is the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in `l`) is printed**
