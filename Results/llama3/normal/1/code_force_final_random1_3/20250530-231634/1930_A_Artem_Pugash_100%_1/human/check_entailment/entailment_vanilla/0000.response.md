Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The move involves choosing two integers x and y, adding the minimum of x and y to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The given program sorts the list of integers in ascending order and then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2. In each iteration, it adds the current integer to the score. This approach ensures that the minimum of each pair of integers is added to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the final score.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses a efficient approach to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
