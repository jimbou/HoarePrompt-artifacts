Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    score = 0
    for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
        score += l[i]
    print(score)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is increased by the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in `l`, `i` is 2n-2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0, and score (which is the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in `l`) is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element, `i` is 2n, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0., and this is printed: the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is the sum of all even-indexed elements in `l`, `i` is 2n, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, and the sum of all even-indexed elements in `l` which is `score` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
