The value of `score` is increased by `l[i]`, where `i` is 4. Since `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `l[4]` is the 5th smallest integer in the list. The value of `score` was previously increased by `l[0]` and `l[2]`, which are the smallest and 3rd smallest integers in the list, respectively. Therefore, the value of `score` is now increased by the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, and 5th smallest integers in the list.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is increased by the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, and 5th smallest integers in `l`, `i` is 4, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0**
