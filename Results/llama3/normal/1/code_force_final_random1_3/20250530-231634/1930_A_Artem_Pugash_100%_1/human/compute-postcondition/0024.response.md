To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `2 * n` is greater than 0, since the range starts from 0 and increments by 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is 0, `i` is 0, `2 * n` must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers**
