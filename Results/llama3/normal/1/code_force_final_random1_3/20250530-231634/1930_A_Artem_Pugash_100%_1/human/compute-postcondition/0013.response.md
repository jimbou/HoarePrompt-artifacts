To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is within the range of `0` to `2 * n` with a step of `2`.

Given the initial state, we can make the following adjustments:

* `n` must be greater than 0 (already satisfied by the initial state)
* `i` must be within the range of `0` to `2 * n` with a step of `2`

Since `i` is initially set to `2n-2`, which is within the range, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we need to ensure that `2 * n` is at least 2 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `2 * n` must be at least 2**
