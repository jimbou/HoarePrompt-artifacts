To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to `2 * n` with a step size of 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `2 * n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

Since the step size is 2, the next value of `i` will be 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `2 * n` must be greater than 4.

The other variables in the state, `n`, `l`, `score`, and `stdin`, are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is `l[2] + l[i]`, `i` is 4, `2 * n` must be greater than 4, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers**
