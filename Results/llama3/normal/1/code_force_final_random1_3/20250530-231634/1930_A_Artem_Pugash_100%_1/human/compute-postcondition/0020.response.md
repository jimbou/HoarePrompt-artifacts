The code prints the value of `score`, which is the sum of every other element of the sorted list `l` starting from the first element.

Since `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, and `score` is the sum of every other element starting from the first element, the value of `score` will be the sum of the smallest, third smallest, fifth smallest, and so on, up to the (2n-1)th smallest elements in the list.

The exact value of `score` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values in the list `l`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the sum of every other element of the list `l` starting from the first element.

Output: **the sum of every other element of the list l starting from the first element**
