The code `score += l[i]` adds the value of `l[i]` to `score`. Since `i` is 2, `l[i]` is the third element of the sorted list `l`. The value of `score` is initially equal to the first element of `l`. After the addition, `score` will be equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `2 * n` must be at least 4**
