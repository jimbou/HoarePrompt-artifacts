Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and then reads the `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It initializes a variable `score` to 0, which will store the maximum final score.
5. It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`), adding the smaller of each pair of integers to the `score`. This is the key insight: by sorting the integers, we can ensure that we're always adding the smaller of each pair to the score, which maximizes the final score.
6. Finally, it prints the `score` for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
