The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Since `i` is 0, the value of `score` is incremented by the first element of the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `2 * n` must be at least 2**
