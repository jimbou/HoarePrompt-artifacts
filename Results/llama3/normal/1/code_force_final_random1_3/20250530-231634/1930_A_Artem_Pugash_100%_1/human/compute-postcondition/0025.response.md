Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is `l[0]`, `i` is 0, `2 * n` must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers**

In this output state, the value of `score` has been updated to include the first element of the list `l`, which is `l[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers.
