To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `2 * n` must be at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time), so `i` becomes 4. For the loop to execute again, `2 * n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 4, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `2 * n` must be at least 6**
