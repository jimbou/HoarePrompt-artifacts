To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute as long as there are more inputs to read from `stdin`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is an integer between 1 and 50
* `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7
* `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element
* `i` is 2n
* `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers
* `n` must be greater than 0

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head. The loop will execute again if there is another test case to read from `stdin`. This means we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to reflect that there is one less test case remaining.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element, `i` is 2n, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0**

Note that we didn't adjust the values of `n`, `l`, `score`, or `i`, as they are not directly related to the loop head. We only adjusted the state of `stdin` to reflect that there is one less test case remaining.
