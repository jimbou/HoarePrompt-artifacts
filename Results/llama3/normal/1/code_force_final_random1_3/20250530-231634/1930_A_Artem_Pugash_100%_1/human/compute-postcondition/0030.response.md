Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is the sum of all even-indexed elements in `l`, `i` is 2n, `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `score` will be the sum of all even-indexed elements in the list `l`. The value of `i` will be equal to `2n`, which is the last index of the list `l`. The other variables, `n` and `l`, remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the remaining test cases.
