Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element, `i` is 2n, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `score` will be the sum of every other element of the list `l`, starting from the first element. The value of `i` will be equal to `2n`, which is the total number of elements in the list `l`. The other variables, `n`, `l`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
