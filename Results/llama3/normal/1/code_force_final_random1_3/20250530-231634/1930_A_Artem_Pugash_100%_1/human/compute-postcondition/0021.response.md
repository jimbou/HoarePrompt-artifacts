The code prints the value of `score` which is the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element.
Output: ** `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element, `i` is 2n, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0., and this is printed: the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element**
