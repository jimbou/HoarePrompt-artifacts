The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2), so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `2 * n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is increased by `l[0]`, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0**
