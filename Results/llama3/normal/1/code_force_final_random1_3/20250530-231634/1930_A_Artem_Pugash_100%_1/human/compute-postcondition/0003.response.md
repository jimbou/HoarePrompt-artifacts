Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is increased by `l[0]`, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `score` is increased by the first element of the sorted list `l`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^7. The values of `n`, `l`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
