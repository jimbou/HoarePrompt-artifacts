Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is increased by the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in `l`, `i` is 2n-2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `score` will be the sum of all the odd-indexed elements in the sorted list `l`, and the loop counter `i` will be at its final value of `2n-2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
