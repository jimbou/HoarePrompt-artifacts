The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 50, l is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, score is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50, l is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, score is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `i` is 0,  `n` must be greater than 0**
