The code prints the value of `score` which is the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in the sorted list `l`. Since the exact values of the integers in `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `score`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated score.

Output: ** `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `l` is a sorted list of 2n integers between 1 and 10^7, `score` is increased by the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in `l`, `i` is 2n-2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by 2n integers, `n` must be greater than 0, and score (which is the sum of the smallest, 3rd smallest, 5th smallest, ..., (2n-1)th smallest integers in `l`) is printed**
