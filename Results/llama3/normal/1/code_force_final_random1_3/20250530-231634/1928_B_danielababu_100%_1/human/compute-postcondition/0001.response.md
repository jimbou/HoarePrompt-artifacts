To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will execute as long as `arr` has at least one element, because the range starts from `len(arr) - 1` and goes down to `-1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
