To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate from the last index of `arr` down to 0, decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

The current state is:

* `arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element
* `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1
* `tem` is the product of the last element of `arr` and 1
* `i` is `len(arr) - 1`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the values of `i` and `arr` (if necessary).

Since `i` is currently `len(arr) - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 2`, because the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time.

The length of `arr` remains the same, so `arr` does not need to be adjusted.

The values of `ans` and `tem` are not affected by the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `tem` is the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**
