To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than -1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(arr) - 3`.

The state of `arr` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `ans` and `tem` are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and the product of the second last element of `arr` and the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `tem` is the product of the second last element of `arr` and the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`**
