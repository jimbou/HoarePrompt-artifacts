Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, the product of the second last element of arr and the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the product of the second last element of arr, the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the element of arr at index i, tem is the product of the second last element of arr, the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the element of arr at index i, i is len(arr) - 3**

The code multiplies the value of `tem` by the element of `arr` at index `i`, and appends the result to the list `ans`. The value of `tem` is updated to be the product of the second last element of `arr`, the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and the element of `arr` at index `i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The list `arr` and the initial elements of `ans` are not modified by the code.
