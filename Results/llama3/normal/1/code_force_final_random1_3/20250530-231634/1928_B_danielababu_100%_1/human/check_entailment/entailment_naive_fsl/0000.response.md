Correctness: **False**.

The program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. However, the provided code does not contain any logic to achieve this. It only contains some general-purpose functions for input/output and sorting, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem.

To solve this problem, the program should sort the input array, then iterate over the array to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. The program should also consider the constraint that the permutation should consist of distinct integers from 1 to n.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program should output 2, because we can add a permutation [2, 1, 4, 3, 5] to make the array [3, 3, 4, 4, 5], where the number 3 and 4 occur twice.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it is incorrect.
