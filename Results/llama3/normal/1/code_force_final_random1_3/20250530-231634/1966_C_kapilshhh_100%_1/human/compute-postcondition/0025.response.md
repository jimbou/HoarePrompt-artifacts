The only variable in the loop head is variable tc, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable tc.  If tc is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, tc is greater than or equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time tc must be greater than 0.
State: **tc is greater than 0, n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, i is n, dp is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of dp. If dp is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**
