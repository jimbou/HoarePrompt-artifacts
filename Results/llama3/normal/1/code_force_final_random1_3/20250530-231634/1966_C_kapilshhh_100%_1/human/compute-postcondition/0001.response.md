To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `tc > 0`.

Given that `tc` is a positive integer (1 <= tc <= 10^4), we can see that `tc` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `tc` for the loop to execute the first time.

The state of `stdin` containing multiple test cases does not affect the loop condition, so no adjustments are needed there either.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer (1 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
