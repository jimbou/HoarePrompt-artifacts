Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer (1 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 2, dp is either True if the difference between the current and next element in arr is greater than 1 or the previous value of dp is False**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. If the difference between the current and next element in `arr` is greater than 1, `dp` becomes True. Otherwise, `dp` becomes the opposite of its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
