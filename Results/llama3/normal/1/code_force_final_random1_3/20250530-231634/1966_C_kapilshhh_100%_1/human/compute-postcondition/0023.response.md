Output: **tc is greater than 0, n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, i is n, dp is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of dp. If dp is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**
