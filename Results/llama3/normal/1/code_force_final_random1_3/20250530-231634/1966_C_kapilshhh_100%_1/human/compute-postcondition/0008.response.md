Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer (1 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 3, dp is True if the difference between the current and next element in arr is greater than 1 or the previous value of dp is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases, the input for test cases, the size of the array, the array itself, and the index `i` remain unchanged. The value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between the current and next element in the array and the previous value of `dp`. If the difference is greater than 1 or the previous value of `dp` is False, then `dp` becomes True; otherwise, it remains False.
