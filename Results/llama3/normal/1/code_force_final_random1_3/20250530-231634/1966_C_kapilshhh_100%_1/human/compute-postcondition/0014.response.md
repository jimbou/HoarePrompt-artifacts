Output State: **tc is greater than 0, n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, i is n - 1, dp is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of dp. If dp is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `arr`, and `dp`. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, replacing the original value of `n`. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, removes duplicates, sorts them in descending order, and appends a 0 at the end, assigning the result to `arr`. The third line sets `dp` to True. The fourth line updates the value of `n` to be the length of `arr` minus 1.

The initial state's information about `tc`, `i`, and the printing of 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the value of `dp` remains valid, as these variables are not modified by the code snippet.
