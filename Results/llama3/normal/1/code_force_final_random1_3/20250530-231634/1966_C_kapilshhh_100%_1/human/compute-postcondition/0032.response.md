Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1) and at least 3, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 3, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, including the pair at index 3 and 4, False otherwise**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated to include the pair of adjacent elements at index 3 and 4 in the `arr` list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `dp` variable now checks if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, including the pair at index 3 and 4.
