Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer (0 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases (`tc`) has decreased by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same. The input stream (`stdin`) still contains multiple test cases minus one. The values of `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `dp` are unchanged, and the printing of 'Alice' or 'Bob' still depends on the value of `dp`.
