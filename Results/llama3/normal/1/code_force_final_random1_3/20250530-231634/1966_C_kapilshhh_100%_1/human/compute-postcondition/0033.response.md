Output State: **tc is greater than 0, n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, i is 1, dp is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of dp. If dp is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the exception that the value of `i` is now 1, and the value of `dp` is updated to reflect whether there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1. The values of `tc`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
