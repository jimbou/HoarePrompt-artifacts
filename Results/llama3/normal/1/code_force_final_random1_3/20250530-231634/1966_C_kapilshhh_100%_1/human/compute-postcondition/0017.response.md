To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1). For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 2, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, including the pair at index `i` and `i+1`, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**
