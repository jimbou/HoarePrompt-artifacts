The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which means the loop will not execute. So, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value that is less than `n`. Since the loop starts from 1, `i` should be 1.

State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1) and at least 2, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 1, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**
