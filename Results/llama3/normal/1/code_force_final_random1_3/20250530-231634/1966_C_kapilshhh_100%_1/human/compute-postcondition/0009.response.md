Output State: **tc is a positive integer (1 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, i is n - 1, dp is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` has reached the second last index of the array `arr` (i.e., `n-1`), and the variable `dp` is set to `True` if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in the array `arr` with a difference greater than 1, and `False` otherwise. The values of `tc` and `n` remain unchanged, and the array `arr` remains the same.
