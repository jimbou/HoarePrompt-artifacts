Output State: **`tc` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 1, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

The value of `tc` is decremented by 1, but it was initially greater than 0, so it is now greater than or equal to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
