Output State: **tc is a positive integer (1 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads `n` integers from the input, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, sorts the remaining integers in descending order, and appends a 0 to the end of the list. The length of this list minus one is assigned back to `n`. The variable `dp` is set to True. The value of `tc` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one.
