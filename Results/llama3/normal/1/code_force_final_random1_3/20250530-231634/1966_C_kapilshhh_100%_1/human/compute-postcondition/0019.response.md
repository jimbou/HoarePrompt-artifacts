State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 3, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, including the pair at index `i` and `i+1`, or if `dp` was previously False, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**
