Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1) and at least 2, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 1, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is 1, this condition checks if the difference between the first and second elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` is currently False. If either of these conditions is true, `dp` is set to True; otherwise, it is set to False. The other variables remain unchanged.
