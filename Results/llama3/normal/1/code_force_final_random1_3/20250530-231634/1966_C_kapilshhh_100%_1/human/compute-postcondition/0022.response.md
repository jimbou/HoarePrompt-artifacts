Based on the precondition, the value of `dp` determines what will be printed. If `dp` is `True`, it means there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in the list `arr` with a difference greater than 1. In this case, 'Alice' will be printed.

On the other hand, if `dp` is `False`, it means there are no pairs of adjacent elements in the list `arr` with a difference greater than 1. In this case, 'Bob' will be printed.

Since the exact value of `dp` is not provided, we can't determine exactly what will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on the value of `dp`.

Output: **'Alice' if dp is True, 'Bob' if dp is False**
