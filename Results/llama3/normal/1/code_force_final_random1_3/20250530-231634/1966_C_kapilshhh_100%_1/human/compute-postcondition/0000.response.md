Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer (1 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. Since the initial state specifies that the number of test cases is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, the value of `tc` will be within this range. The rest of the input, containing multiple test cases with two inputs each, remains unchanged in the stdin.
