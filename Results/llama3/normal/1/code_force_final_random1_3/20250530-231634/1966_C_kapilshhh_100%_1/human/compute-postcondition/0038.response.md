Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n distinct integers. It then determines whether there exists at least one pair of adjacent integers with a difference greater than 1. If such a pair exists, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Bob'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
