Output State: **tc is greater than or equal to 0, n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, i is n, dp is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of dp. If dp is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of tc has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to 0. The values of n, arr, i, and dp remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The printing of 'Alice' or 'Bob' still depends on the value of dp.
