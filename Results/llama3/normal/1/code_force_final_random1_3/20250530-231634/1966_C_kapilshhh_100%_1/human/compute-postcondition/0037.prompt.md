Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is a positive integer (1 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is a positive integer (0 <= tc <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: tc is greater than or equal to 0, n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, i is n, dp is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of dp. If dp is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tc` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 1, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
