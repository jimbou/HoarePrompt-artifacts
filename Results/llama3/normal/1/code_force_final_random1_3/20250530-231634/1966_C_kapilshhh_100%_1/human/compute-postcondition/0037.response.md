Output State: **`tc` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 1, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing all the test cases, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `tc` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed; `n` is a positive integer, representing the number of elements in the last test case; `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, representing the last test case; `i` is 1, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the last test case; and `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, False otherwise, determining whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed.
