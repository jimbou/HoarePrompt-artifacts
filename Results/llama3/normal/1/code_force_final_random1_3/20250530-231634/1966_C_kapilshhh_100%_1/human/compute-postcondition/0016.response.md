Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer (2 <= n <= 2*10^5 + 1), `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `i` is 1, `dp` is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` with a difference greater than 1, including the pair at index `i` and `i+1`, False otherwise, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tc` remains greater than 0, `n` remains a positive integer between 2 and 2*10^5 + 1, `arr` remains a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, and `i` remains 1. The value of `dp` is updated to True if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i+1` in `arr` is greater than 1, or if `dp` was previously False. The output also includes the printing of either 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on the updated value of `dp`.
