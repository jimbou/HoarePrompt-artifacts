Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to index `i-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `a` has been updated such that each element `a[i]` is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to index `i-1`. The other variables, `n` and `x`, remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs.
