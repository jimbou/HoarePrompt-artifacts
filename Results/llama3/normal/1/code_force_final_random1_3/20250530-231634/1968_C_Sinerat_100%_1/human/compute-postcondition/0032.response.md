Output: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to index `i-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs, and the list `a` is printed, where the first element of `a` is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to index `i-1`**
