Output State: **n is an integer, i is n, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000 and each subsequent element a[i] is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in x up to index i-1, stdin contains no more test cases, and the list a is printed, where the first element of a is 1000 and each subsequent element a[i] is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in x up to index i-1.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will still be an integer, the loop counter `i` will have reached its final value `n`, the list `x` will still contain integers, and the list `a` will have been fully populated with the cumulative sums of the elements in `x` plus 1000. Additionally, there will be no more test cases left in the standard input (`stdin`), and the final list `a` will have been printed.
