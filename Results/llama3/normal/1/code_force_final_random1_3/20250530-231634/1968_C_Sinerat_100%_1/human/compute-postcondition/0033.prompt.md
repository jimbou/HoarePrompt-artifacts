Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). The second line contains n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of `x` plus 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the list `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least n, i is n-1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element is 1000 plus the second element of x, the fourth element is 1000 plus the second element of x plus the third element of x, and so on, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus n-1 inputs, and the list a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to index `i-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs, and the list `a` is printed, where the first element of `a` is 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to index `i-1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
