According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs**
