The value of `a[i]` is updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]` which is 1000, and `x[i - 1]` is `x[0]`. Therefore, `a[1]` is updated to be 1000 + `x[0]`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs**
