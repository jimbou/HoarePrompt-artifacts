Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 plus the first element of `x`, the third element is 1000 plus the second element of `x`, and the fourth element is 1000 plus the second element of `x` plus the third element of `x`, and the rest of the elements are not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which is equivalent to 1000 plus the second element of `x` plus the third element of `x`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.
