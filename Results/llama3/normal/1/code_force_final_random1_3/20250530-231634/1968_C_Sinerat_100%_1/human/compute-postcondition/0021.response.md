Output: **n is at least n, i is n-1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 plus the first element of x, the third element is 1000 plus the second element of x, the fourth element is 1000 plus the second element of x plus the third element of x, and so on, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus n-1 inputs, and the list a is being printed**
