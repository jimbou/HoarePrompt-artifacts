Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and the fourth element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer greater than 3. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 3. The value of `x` remains the same, which is a list of integers. The value of `a` has been updated, where the first three elements remain the same, and the fourth element is now the sum of the first three elements plus `x[2]`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs.
