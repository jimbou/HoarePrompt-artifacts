Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000 and the second element is 1000 + `x[0]` and the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the current element `x[i - 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `a` now has its third element updated to be the sum of the first two elements and the second element of list `x`.
