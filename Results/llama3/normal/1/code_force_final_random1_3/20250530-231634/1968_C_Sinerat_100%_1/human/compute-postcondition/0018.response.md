Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 plus the first element of `x`, the third element is 1000 plus the second element of `x`, the fourth element is 1000 plus the second element of `x` plus the third element of `x`, and the fifth element is 1000 plus the second element of `x` plus the third element of `x` plus the fourth element of `x`, and the rest of the elements are not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which is equivalent to the fourth element of `a` plus the third element of `x`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
