Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000 and the second element is 1000 + `x[0]` and the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` and the fourth element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]` and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which means the fourth element of `a` is now 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
