Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of `x` plus 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`. The list `a` will have its first element as 1000, and the rest of the elements will be the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in list `x` plus 1000. The value of `n` and the contents of list `x` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
