The code prints the elements of the list `a`. The list `a` contains `n` integers, where the first element is 1000 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sum of `x` plus 1000.

Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of `a` as described above.

Output: **1000, (x[0] + 1000), (x[0] + x[1] + 1000), ..., (cumulative sum of x up to the (n-1)th element + 1000)**
