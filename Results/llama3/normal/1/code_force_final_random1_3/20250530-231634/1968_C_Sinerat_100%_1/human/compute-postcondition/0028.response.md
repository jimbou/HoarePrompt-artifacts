The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, and the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs**
