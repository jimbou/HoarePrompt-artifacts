The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000 and the second element is 1000 + `x[0]` and the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**
