Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, and the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the current element `x[i - 1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `a` now has its third element updated, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `n` minus 1 inputs.
