Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n-1 integers. It then generates a list of n integers, where the first element is 1000 and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of 1000 and the previous elements in the input list. Finally, it prints the generated list for each test case.**
