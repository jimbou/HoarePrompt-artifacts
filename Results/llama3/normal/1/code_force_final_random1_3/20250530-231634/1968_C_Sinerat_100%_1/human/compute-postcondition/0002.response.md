The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1,  `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
