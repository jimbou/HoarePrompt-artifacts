The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding the value of `x[i - 1]` to the value of `a[i - 1]`. 

Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]` which is 1000, and `x[i - 1]` is `x[0]`. 

So, `a[1]` is updated to be 1000 + `x[0]`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000 and the second element is 1000 + `x[0]` and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**
