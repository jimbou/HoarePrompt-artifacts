Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of a single integer `n` followed by `n-1` integers.
2. It initializes the first element of the output list `a` to 1000, which satisfies the condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
3. For each subsequent element `a[i]`, it calculates the value as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, where `x[i-1]` is the corresponding element from the input list. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` holds true for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.
4. The program prints the generated list `a` for each test case.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the output matches the expected results for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
