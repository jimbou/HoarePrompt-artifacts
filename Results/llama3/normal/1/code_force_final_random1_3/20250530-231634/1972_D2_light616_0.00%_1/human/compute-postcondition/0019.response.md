The code `y = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `y`. The initial state specifies that `y` is greater than or equal to 1, but now it is specifically set to 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt` remain the same as before, but the value of `y` is now specifically set to 1.
