Output State: **`t` is at least `t`, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` will be at least equal to its initial value (since it's an integer between 1 and 10^4), there will still be no input in stdin, and the function `func_1()` will have been executed a total of `t` times.
