The only variable in the loop head is variable x and n, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and n. If x * x is less than or equal to n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 3 and n is greater than or equal to 10. For the loop to be executed one more time, n must be greater than or equal to 16.
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 15, `x` is 3, `y` is 5, `cnt` is increased by at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 16**
