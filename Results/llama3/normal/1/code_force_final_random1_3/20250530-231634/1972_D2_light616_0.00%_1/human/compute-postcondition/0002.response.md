Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify it. The stdin still contains no input, as there is no input operation performed in the code. The function `func_1()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are unknown, as its implementation is not provided.
