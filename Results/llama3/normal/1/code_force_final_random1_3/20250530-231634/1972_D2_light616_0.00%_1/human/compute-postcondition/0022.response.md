To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

The code is: `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 6
- `m` is greater than or equal to 3
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1

Let's substitute the values of `x` and `y` into the expression:
- `x + y` = 2 + 1 = 3
- `n / ((x + y) * x)` = `n / (3 * 2)` = `n / 6`
- `m // ((x + y) * y)` = `m // (3 * 1)` = `m // 3`

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `n / 6` will be greater than or equal to 1.
Since `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `m // 3` will be greater than or equal to 1.

The `min` function will return the smaller of the two values. Since both values are greater than or equal to 1, the minimum value will be 1.

Therefore, `cnt` will be incremented by 1.

The output state is:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 6
- `m` is greater than or equal to 3
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1 (since it was incremented by 1)

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1**
