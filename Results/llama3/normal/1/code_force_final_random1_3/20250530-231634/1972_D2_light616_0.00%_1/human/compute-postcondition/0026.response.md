According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. For the loop to execute again, the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must be met.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, and `m` is greater than or equal to 3. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the values of `n` and `m` to be greater than or equal to the values that would satisfy the conditions.

Since `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8` and `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`, we need `n` to be greater than or equal to 8 and `m` to be greater than or equal to 8.

The values of `x` and `y` do not need to be adjusted, as they are already fixed at 2. The value of `cnt` is not relevant to the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2**
