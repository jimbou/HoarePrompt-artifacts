Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function 1 calculates the count of pairs of coprime numbers (x, y) such that (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m. However, the problem statement does not explicitly mention coprime numbers. Instead, it requires b * gcd(a, b) to be a multiple of a + b. The function seems to be using a different approach, which might not be correct.

Moreover, the function uses a while loop to iterate over x and y, but the loop conditions are not clearly related to the problem statement. The function also uses the math.gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor of x and y, but it's not clear how this is used to satisfy the condition b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function 2 reads an integer t from standard input and executes Function 1 t times. This function seems to be correct, as it simply reads the input and calls Function 1 the required number of times.

However, since Function 1 is not clearly correct, the overall program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
