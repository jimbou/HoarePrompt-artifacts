Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `n` divided by 6 and `m` divided by 12. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.***
