The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
