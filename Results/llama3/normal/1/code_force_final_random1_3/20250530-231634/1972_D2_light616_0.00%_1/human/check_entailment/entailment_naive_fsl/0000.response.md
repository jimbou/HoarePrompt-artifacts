Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the mathematical formula for counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The formula is based on the fact that b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b if and only if (a + b) * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a * b.

The program uses two functions: func_1() and func_2(). func_1() calculates the count of valid pairs for a single test case, and func_2() reads the number of test cases and calls func_1() for each test case.

In func_1(), the program iterates over all possible values of x (1 <= x <= sqrt(n)) and y (1 <= y <= m / (x + y)). For each pair (x, y), it checks if gcd(x, y) is 1. If it is, the program increments the count by the minimum of n / ((x + y) * x) and m / ((x + y) * y). This is because for each pair (x, y), there are min(n / ((x + y) * x), m / ((x + y) * y)) pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n or m is 1. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
