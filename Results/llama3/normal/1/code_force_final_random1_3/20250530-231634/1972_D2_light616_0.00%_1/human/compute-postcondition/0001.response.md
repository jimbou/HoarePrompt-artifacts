The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make it explicit that the loop will execute, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains no input**
