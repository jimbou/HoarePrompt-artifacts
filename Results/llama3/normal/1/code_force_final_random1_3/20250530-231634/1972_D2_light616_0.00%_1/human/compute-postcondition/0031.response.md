Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 15, `x` is 2, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by at least 1 and equals to `cnt` plus the minimum of `n / 15` and `m / 12`**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n / 15` and `m / 12`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 10 and `m` is greater than or equal to 15, the minimum of `n / 15` and `m / 12` is at least 0.66 (when `n` is 10 and `m` is 15) and at most 1 (when `n` is 15 and `m` is 15). Therefore, the value of `cnt` is increased by at least 0.66 and at most 1.
