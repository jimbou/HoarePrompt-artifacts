Reasoning:

The problem asks to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case, and `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
2. It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0 and two variables `x` and `y` to 1.
3. The outer while loop iterates over `x` from 1 to √n (inclusive). This is because the condition `b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b` implies that `x` must be a divisor of `a`.
4. The inner while loop iterates over `y` from 1 to a value such that `(x + y) * x ≤ n` and `(x + y) * y ≤ m`. This is because the condition `1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m` implies that `a` and `b` must be within the ranges `[1, n]` and `[1, m]`, respectively.
5. Inside the inner loop, it checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1`. If true, it increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This is because the condition `b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b` implies that `b` must be a multiple of `x + y`, and the minimum of the two divisions ensures that we don't count pairs that exceed the bounds of `n` or `m`.
6. After the inner loop, it increments `x` by 1.
7. After the outer loop, it prints the value of `cnt`.
8. `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program appears to be correct, as it iterates over all possible values of `x` and `y` that satisfy the conditions, and correctly increments the counter `cnt` for each valid pair. The use of `min` to ensure that we don't count pairs that exceed the bounds of `n` or `m` is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
