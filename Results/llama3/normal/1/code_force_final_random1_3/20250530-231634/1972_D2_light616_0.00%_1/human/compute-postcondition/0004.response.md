Output State: **`t` is at least 2, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed twice.**

The code snippet is simply a call to the function `func_1()`, which has already been executed once in the initial state. Since the function is called again, it will be executed for the second time. The values of the variables `t` and stdin remain unchanged, as there are no operations that affect them in the code snippet.
