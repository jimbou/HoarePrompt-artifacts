To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the value of `t` is greater than the current iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is at least 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed twice. This means that the loop has already executed twice, and the value of `_` (the loop variable) is not relevant to the state of the program.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `t`. Since `t` is at least 2, and the loop has already executed twice, the value of `t` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least 3, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed twice.**
