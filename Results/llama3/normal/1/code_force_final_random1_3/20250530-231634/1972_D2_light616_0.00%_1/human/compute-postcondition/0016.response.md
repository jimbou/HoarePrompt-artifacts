Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `m` are positive integers, `x` is 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is always 1.
