Reasoning:

The problem statement requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function `func_1()` calculates and prints the count of pairs of coprime numbers (x, y) such that (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m. This function seems to be related to the problem, but it does not directly calculate the required count of pairs (a, b).

However, upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the conditions (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m are equivalent to the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, respectively, when a = x * (x + y) and b = y * (x + y). Moreover, the condition gcd(x, y) == 1 ensures that gcd(a, b) = x + y, which implies that b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Therefore, the function `func_1()` is actually calculating the required count of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer `t` from standard input and executes the function `func_1()` `t` times. This is consistent with the problem statement, which mentions that the input contains multiple test cases.

Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
