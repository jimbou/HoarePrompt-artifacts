Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 15, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by at least 1 plus the minimum of `n / ((3 + 1) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 1) * 1)`, `n` is greater than or equal to 16. The current values of `x` and `y` have a greatest common divisor of 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `m` is still greater than or equal to 15, `x` is still 3, `y` is still 1, `cnt` has been increased by at least 1 plus the minimum of `n / 12` and `m // 4`, `n` is still greater than or equal to 16. The current values of `x` and `y` still have a greatest common divisor of 1.
