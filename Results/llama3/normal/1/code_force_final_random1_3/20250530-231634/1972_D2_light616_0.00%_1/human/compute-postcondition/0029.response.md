The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The value of `y` was 2, so the new value of `y` is 3. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is now 1, since 2 and 3 are coprime. Therefore, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n / 16` and `m / 16`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 8 and `m` is greater than or equal to 8, the minimum of `n / 16` and `m / 16` is at least 0.5. However, since `cnt` is an integer, it is increased by at least 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by at least 1.**
