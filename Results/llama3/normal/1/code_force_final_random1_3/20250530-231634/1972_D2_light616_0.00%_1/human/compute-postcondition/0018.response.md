According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `n`. If `x` * `x` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `n` being greater than or equal to 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 5. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 2, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0**
