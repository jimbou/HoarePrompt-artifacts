Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 4. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is increased by at least 1.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition "If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is increased by at least 1" is still valid, but since `x` is 1 and `y` is 4, their greatest common divisor is 1, so `cnt` is indeed increased by at least 1.
