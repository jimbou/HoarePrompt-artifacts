Output State: **`t` is at least 3, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed three times.**

The code calls the function `func_1()`, which has already been executed twice in the initial state. After executing the code, the function `func_1()` has now been executed a total of three times. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and there is still no input in stdin.
