Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 18. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n / 36` and `m / 36`**.

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `y` being 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and its effect on `cnt` is still applicable, but since `x` is 3 and `y` is now 4, their greatest common divisor is 1, so `cnt` would be increased by the minimum of `n / 36` and `m / 36` if this condition is met.
