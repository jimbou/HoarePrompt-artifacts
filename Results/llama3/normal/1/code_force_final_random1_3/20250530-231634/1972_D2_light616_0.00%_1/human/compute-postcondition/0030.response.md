According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. For the loop to execute again, the following conditions must be met:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, and `m` is greater than or equal to 8.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` as follows:

* `x` and `y` cannot be changed, as they are not in the loop head.
* `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * x`, which is `(2 + 3) * 2 = 10`. So, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.
* `m` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * y`, which is `(2 + 3) * 3 = 15`. So, `m` must be greater than or equal to 15.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 15, `x` is 2, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by at least 1**
