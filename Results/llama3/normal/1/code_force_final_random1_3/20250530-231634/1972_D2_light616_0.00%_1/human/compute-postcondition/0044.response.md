Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 15, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is increased by at least 1 plus the minimum of `n / ((3 + 2) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 2) * 2)`, `n` is greater than or equal to 16, and the current values of `x` and `y` have a greatest common divisor of 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `m` is still greater than or equal to 15, `x` is still 3, `y` is still 2, `cnt` is increased by at least 1 plus the minimum of `n / 15` and `m // 10`, `n` is still greater than or equal to 16, and `x` and `y` still have a greatest common divisor of 1.
