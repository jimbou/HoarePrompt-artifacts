Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 2, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0.**

The code increments the value of `x` by 1. Since `x` was initially 1, its new value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged, so their initial conditions still apply.
