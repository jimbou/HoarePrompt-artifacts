Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing the (count of the first element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet**

In this output state, the value of `j` is still 0, and the value of `i` and `l` are unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The array, alp, and rev_array are also unchanged. However, the ans list now contains a new element, which is the (count of the first element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet. The string of lowercase English letters is still printed, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet.
