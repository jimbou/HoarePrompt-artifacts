Output State: **`i` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing three elements, the first element is the `c - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the first element in the rev_array list, the second element is the `d - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `d` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list, and the third element is the `e - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `e` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list starting from index `j`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 0, `l` is still greater than 2, and `j` is still 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The array, alp, and rev_array lists remain unchanged. The ans list now contains three elements: the first element is the `c - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the first element in the rev_array list, the second element is the `d - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `d` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list, and the third element is the `e - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `e` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list starting from index `j`.
