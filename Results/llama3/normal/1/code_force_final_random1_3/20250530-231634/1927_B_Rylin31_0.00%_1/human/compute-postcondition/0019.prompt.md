Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 1, j is l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is an empty list, l is an integer
Code of the loop:
for j in range(l):
    ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers from `array`, `ans` is a list containing a single lowercase English letter that is the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, `l` is an integer that must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers from `array`, `ans` is a list containing two lowercase English letters where the second letter is the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, `l` is an integer that must be greater than 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers from `array`, `ans` is a list containing three lowercase English letters where the second letter is the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet and the third letter is the (count of the (j+1)th element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, `l` is an integer that must be greater than 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
