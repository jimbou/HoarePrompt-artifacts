The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `l`. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `l` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `l` must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing two elements, the first element is the `c - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the first element in the rev_array list, and the second element is the `d - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `d` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list.**
