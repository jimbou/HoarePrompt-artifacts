The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `l`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is the `c - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list starting from index `j`, and the string formed by joining all elements of the ans list is printed**
