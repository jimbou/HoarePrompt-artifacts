To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l`. If `l` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust `l` to be greater than 0 and `j` to be 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is an empty list**
