Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing the (count of the first element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet and the (count of the second element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the (count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, which is appended to the existing list. The other variables remain unchanged.
