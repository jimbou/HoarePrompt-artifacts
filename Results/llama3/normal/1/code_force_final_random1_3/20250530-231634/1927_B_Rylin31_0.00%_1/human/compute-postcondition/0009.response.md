The code prints a string formed by concatenating the elements of the `ans` list. The `ans` list contains `l` elements, where each element is the `c - 1`-th element of the `alp` list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the `rev_array` list starting from index `j`. Since `j` is equal to `l`, the `j`-th element is the last element of the `rev_array` list. The `rev_array` list is a reversed list of integers from the `array` list. The `alp` list contains lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z'. The `map(str, ans)` function converts each element of the `ans` list to a string. The `''.join(...)` function concatenates these strings into a single string.

Output: **a string formed by concatenating the letters of the alphabet corresponding to the count of occurrences of the last element of the reversed array, repeated l times**
