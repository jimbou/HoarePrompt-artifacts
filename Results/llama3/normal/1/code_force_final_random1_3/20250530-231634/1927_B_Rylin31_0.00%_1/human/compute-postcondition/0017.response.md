To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `l`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `l`. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `l` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers from `array`, `ans` is a list containing two lowercase English letters where the second letter is the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, `l` is an integer that must be greater than 2**
