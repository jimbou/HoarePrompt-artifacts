The `print` statement will print a string of lowercase English letters, where each letter is determined by the count of the corresponding element in the reversed list `rev_array` minus 1, and then mapped to the corresponding letter of the alphabet.

Since `ans` is a list containing `l` lowercase English letters, the `join` function will concatenate these letters into a single string.

Output: **a string of lowercase English letters where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, repeated `l` times**
