Output State: **`i` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing two elements, the first element is the `c - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the first element in the rev_array list, and the second element is the `d - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `d` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the `d - 1`-th element of the `alp` list, where `d` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the `rev_array` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
