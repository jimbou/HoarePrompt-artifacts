Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is `l`, `l` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing the (count of the first element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, the (count of the second element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and so on until the (count of the last element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `l`, and the list `ans` will contain the (count of each element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, in order. The other variables remain unchanged.
