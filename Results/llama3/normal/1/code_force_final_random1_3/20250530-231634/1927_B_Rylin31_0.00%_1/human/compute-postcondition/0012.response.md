Output State: **i is 1, j is l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is an empty list, l is an integer**.

In this final state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and the value of `j` is now equal to `l`, which is an integer read from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, as two inputs have been read. The `array` variable holds a list of integers read from the input, and the `alp` variable remains unchanged as a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z'. The `rev_array` variable holds a reversed list of integers from the `array` list. The `ans` list is empty, and the value of `l` is an integer read from the input.
