Output State: **i is equal to the number of test cases, j is equal to l, stdin is empty, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing l lowercase English letters where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed for each test case, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for all test cases, and for each test case, it has processed the input array, reversed it, counted the occurrences of each element in the reversed array, and printed a string of lowercase English letters corresponding to these counts. The loop variables i and j have reached their final values, and the input has been fully consumed.
