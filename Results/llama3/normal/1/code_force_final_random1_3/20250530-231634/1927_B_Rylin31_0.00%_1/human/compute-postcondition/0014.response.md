Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers from `array`, `ans` is a list containing a single lowercase English letter that is the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, `l` is an integer that must be greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 1, the value of `j` remains 0, the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, the `array` is still a list of integers, the `alp` is still a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', the `rev_array` is still a reversed list of integers from `array`, the `ans` now contains a single lowercase English letter that is the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and the value of `l` is still greater than 0.
