Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `l`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers from `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` lowercase English letters where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, `l` is an integer.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `i`, `stdin`, `array`, `alp`, and `rev_array` as in the initial state. The value of `j` will be equal to `l`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The `ans` list will contain `l` lowercase English letters, each corresponding to the count of the corresponding element in `rev_array` minus 1, and `l` will remain the same integer value as in the initial state.
