Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is `l`, `l` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing the (count of the first element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, the (count of the second element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and so on up to the (count of the last element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `j` has reached the value of `l`, which means the loop has iterated `l` times. The list `ans` now contains the (count of each element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, for all elements in `rev_array`. The other variables remain unchanged.
