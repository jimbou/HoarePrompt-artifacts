The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `l`. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `l` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing one element, which is the `c - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the first element in the rev_array list.**
