Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, l is a positive integer, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for j in range(l):
    ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing one element, which is the `c - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the first element in the rev_array list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing two elements, the first element is the `c - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the first element in the rev_array list, and the second element is the `d - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `d` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing three elements, the first element is the `c - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `c` is the number of occurrences of the first element in the rev_array list, the second element is the `d - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `d` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list, and the third element is the `e - 1`-th element of the alp list, where `e` is the number of occurrences of the `j`-th element in the rev_array list starting from index `j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
