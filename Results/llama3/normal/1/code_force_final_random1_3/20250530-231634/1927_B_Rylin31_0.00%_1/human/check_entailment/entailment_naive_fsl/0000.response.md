Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it generates the string `ans`. The program uses the count of the current element in the reversed array to determine the character to use. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual count of the character in the original string.

For example, consider the input `[0, 1, 1, 0]`. The program will generate the string `['a', 'b', 'b', 'a']`, which is incorrect. The correct string should be `['a', 'b', 'a', 'c']`.

The correct approach would be to use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the original string and use this information to generate the string `ans`.
