#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) — the trace of the string.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n',
            'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
        
        rev_array = array[::-1]
        
        ans = []
        
        for j in range(l):
            ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
        
        print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
        
    #State: i is equal to the number of test cases, j is equal to l, stdin is empty, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing l lowercase English letters where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed for each test case, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers representing a trace of a string. It then processes each test case by reversing the trace, counting the occurrences of each integer in the reversed trace, and mapping these counts to corresponding letters of the alphabet (with the count minus one being the index of the letter). The function prints a string of these letters for each test case, effectively decoding the input trace into a string of lowercase English letters.
