Output State: **i is 2, j is l, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is an empty list, l is an integer equal to the first input, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet**

Explanation:

*   The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `l`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1.
*   The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns them to `array`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1.
*   The third line creates a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' and assigns it to `alp`. This does not affect any existing variables.
*   The fourth line creates a reversed copy of `array` and assigns it to `rev_array`. This does not affect any existing variables.
*   The fifth line creates an empty list and assigns it to `ans`. This does not affect any existing variables.

Note that the code does not modify the values of `i` and `j`, so they remain unchanged. The value of `l` is updated to the first input, and the values of `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`, and `ans` are updated as described above.
