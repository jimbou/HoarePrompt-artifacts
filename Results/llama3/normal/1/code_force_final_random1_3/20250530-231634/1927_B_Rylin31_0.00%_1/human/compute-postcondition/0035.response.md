Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers representing a trace of a string. It then processes each test case by reversing the trace, counting the occurrences of each integer in the reversed trace, and mapping these counts to corresponding letters of the alphabet (with the count minus one being the index of the letter). The function prints a string of these letters for each test case, effectively decoding the input trace into a string of lowercase English letters.**
