Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers from `array`, `ans` is a list containing three lowercase English letters where the second letter is the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet and the third letter is the (count of the (j+1)th element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, `l` is an integer that must be greater than 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending a new letter to the list. The new letter is the (count of the (j+1)th element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
