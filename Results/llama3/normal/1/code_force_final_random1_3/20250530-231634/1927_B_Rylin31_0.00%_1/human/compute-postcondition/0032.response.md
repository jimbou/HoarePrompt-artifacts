The `print` statement will print a string of lowercase English letters, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1)th letter of the alphabet.

Since `rev_array` is a reversed list of integers from `array`, the count of each element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1 will be calculated for each element in `rev_array`. The corresponding letter of the alphabet will be selected based on this count, and the resulting letters will be joined together to form the final string.

For example, if `rev_array` is `[3, 2, 1]`, the count of the first element `3` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1 is 0, so the first letter of the alphabet 'a' will be selected. The count of the second element `2` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1 is 0, so the second letter of the alphabet 'b' will be selected. The count of the last element `1` in the rest of `rev_array` minus 1 is 0, so the last letter of the alphabet 'z' will be selected. The resulting string will be 'abz'.

Output: **a string of lowercase English letters, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet**
