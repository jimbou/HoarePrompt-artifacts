Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `l` is greater than 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', rev_array is a reversed list of integers from array, ans is a list containing the (count of the first element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, the (count of the second element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and the (count of the jth element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and a string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 2, the value of `j` remains 2, the value of `l` remains greater than 2, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2, the array remains the same list of integers, the list of lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' remains the same, the reversed list of integers from array remains the same, the list `ans` now contains three letters: the first letter is the (count of the first element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, the second letter is the (count of the second element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet, and the third letter is the (count of the jth element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet. A string of lowercase English letters is printed, where each letter is the (count of the corresponding element of rev_array in the rest of rev_array minus 1)th letter of the alphabet.
