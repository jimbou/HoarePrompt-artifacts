Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the third line of input, stdin contains at least one line of input.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the two integers from the third line of input, which is stored in `s`. The third line of input is consumed, so stdin now contains at least one line of input. The value of `s` remains the same, which is the third line of input.
