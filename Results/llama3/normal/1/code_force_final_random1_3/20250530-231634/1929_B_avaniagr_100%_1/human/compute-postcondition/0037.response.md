Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is empty, stdin contains at least one more line of input. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then 2n-1 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then 2 times the value of `n` is printed.***
