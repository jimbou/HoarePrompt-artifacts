The `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.

Since `k` is an integer, the division `k / 2` will result in a floating-point number. The `math.ceil` function will then round up this value to the nearest integer.

For example, if `k` is 3, the division `k / 2` would result in 1.5, and `math.ceil` would round this up to 2.

Output: **the ceiling of k divided by 2 (where k is the value of k)**
