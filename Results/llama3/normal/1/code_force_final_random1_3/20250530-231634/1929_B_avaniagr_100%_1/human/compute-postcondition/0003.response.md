The code prints the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.
Since `k` is less than or equal to 4 times the value of `n` minus 4, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k / 2`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.
Output: **the ceiling of the division of k by 2 (where k is an integer less than or equal to 4 times the value of n minus 4)**
