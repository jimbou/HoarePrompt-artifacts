Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line of input, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times the value of `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` is larger than 4 * `n` - 4, then if `k` equals 4 * `n` - 3, 2 * `n` - 1 is printed. If `k` equals 4 * `n` - 2, 2 * `n` is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
