Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the output values printed during the loop's execution.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the output values printed during the loop's execution. The values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly, but the state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
