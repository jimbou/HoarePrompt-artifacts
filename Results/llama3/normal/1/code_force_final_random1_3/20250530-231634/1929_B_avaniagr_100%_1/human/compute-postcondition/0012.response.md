Output: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the second line of input, stdin contains at least one line of input, `k` is larger than 4 * `n` - 4, and `k` is not equal to 4 * `n` - 3. The current value of `k` is equal to 4 * `n` - 2, and 2 * `n` is printed, where `n` is an integer and the value of 2 * `n` is 2 * `n`**
