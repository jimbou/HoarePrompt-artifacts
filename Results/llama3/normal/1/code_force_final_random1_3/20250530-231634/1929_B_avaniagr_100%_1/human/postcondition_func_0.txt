The function reads input from stdin, expecting multiple lines of input where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. It then processes each pair of n and k, and based on the value of k relative to n, it prints a calculated value. The function does not modify the input state and only appends the calculated output values to the output state.
