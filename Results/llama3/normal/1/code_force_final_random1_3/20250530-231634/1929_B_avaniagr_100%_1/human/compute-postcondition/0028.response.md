Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is empty, stdin contains at least one more line of input.**

The code `n, k = map(int, s.split())` assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input string `s`, which is the fourth line of input. Since `s` is now empty, it is no longer the fourth line of input. The values of `n` and `k` are now integers, and the stdin still contains at least one more line of input.
