Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the third line of input, stdin contains at least one line of input. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then the value of 2 times `n` minus 1 is being printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then 2 times the value of `n` is being printed. For all other cases, no value is being printed.***
