To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We are given that `n` and `k` are integers, and `k` is larger than `4 * n - 4` but not equal to `4 * n - 3`. Additionally, the current value of `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2`.

2. **Given Condition**: The condition `k = 4 * n - 2` is crucial for understanding the relationship between `k` and `n`.

3. **Print Statement**: The statement `print(2 * n)` indicates that we are printing the value of `2` multiplied by `n`.

4. **Determining `n`**: Since `k = 4 * n - 2`, we can express `n` in terms of `k` as `n = (k + 2) / 4`. However, without a specific value for `k`, we cannot calculate an exact numerical value for `n`. But we know that `k` is an integer and `k = 4 * n - 2`, which implies that `n` must also be an integer because `k` is an integer.

5. **Output Description**: Given that `n` is an integer and the statement prints `2 * n`, the output will be twice the value of `n`. Since we cannot calculate an exact numerical value for `n` without knowing `k`, we describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **2n (where n is an integer value determined by the relationship k = 4 * n - 2)**
