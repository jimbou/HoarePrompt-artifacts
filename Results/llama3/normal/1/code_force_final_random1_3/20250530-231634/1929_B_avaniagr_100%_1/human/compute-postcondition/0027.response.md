The only object in the loop head is variable `s` and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin. If the stdin has at least one more line of input the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains at least one line of input, `s` is the third line of input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least one more line of input and `s` is the fourth line of input.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is the fourth line of input, stdin contains at least one more line of input. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then the value of 2 times `n` minus 1 is being printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then 2 times the value of `n` is being printed. For all other cases, no value is being printed.**
