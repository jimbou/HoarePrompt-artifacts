Based on the initial state, `n` and `k` are integers, but their exact values are not provided. The variable `s` is empty, but it's not used in the print statement. The fact that stdin contains at least one more line of input is also not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement simply prints the result of the expression `2 * n`. Since `n` is an integer, multiplying it by 2 will result in another integer.

Output: **2 times the value of n (where n is an integer)**
