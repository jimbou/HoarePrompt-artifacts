Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first finds the index of the first '1' (chip) in the array using the `find()` method. This gives the starting point of the block of chips.
2. It then finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the end of the array using the `find()` method on the reversed array. This gives the ending point of the block of chips.
3. It extracts the substring of the array between the starting and ending points of the block of chips using slicing.
4. It counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the extracted substring using the `count()` method. This gives the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the chips are already in a single block (no free cells between them), the program returns 0.
* When there are free cells between the chips, the program correctly counts the number of free cells that need to be removed.
* When there are multiple blocks of chips, the program correctly identifies the starting and ending points of each block and counts the free cells between them.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic to solve the problem, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.
