According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is a substring of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z` of `arr` is being printed**
