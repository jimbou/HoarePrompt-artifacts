Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is either 0 or 1.
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t - 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z of arr has been printed t times.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n binary digits (0s and 1s). It then finds the first and last occurrences of the digit '1' in the string, extracts the substring between these two occurrences, and prints the number of '0' digits in this substring. The function repeats this process for each test case, printing the result for each case.
