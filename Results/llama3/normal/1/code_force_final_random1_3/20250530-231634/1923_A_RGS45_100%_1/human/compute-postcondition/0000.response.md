Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1.
