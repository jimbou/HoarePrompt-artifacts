Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string `arr` representing the cells.
3. It finds the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr` using the `find` method and stores the index in `x`. This gives the starting position of the first block of chips.
4. It finds the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]` using the `find` method and stores the index in `y`. This gives the ending position of the last block of chips.
5. It extracts the substring `z` from `arr` starting from index `x` to `n - y`. This substring contains all the chips.
6. It counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` using the `count` method and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Correctness: **True**
