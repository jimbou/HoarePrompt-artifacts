Reasoning:

The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the binary string `arr` representing the cells.
3. It finds the first occurrence of '1' in the string using `arr.find('1')`, which gives the starting index `x` of the block of chips.
4. It finds the last occurrence of '1' in the string by reversing the string and using `arr[::-1].find('1')`, which gives the ending index `y` of the block of chips (from the right).
5. It extracts the substring `z` between the starting and ending indices `x` and `y` using slicing.
6. It counts the number of '0' digits in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`, which gives the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block, and it handles the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
