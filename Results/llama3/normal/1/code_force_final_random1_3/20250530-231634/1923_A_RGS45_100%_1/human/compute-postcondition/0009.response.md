To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to remain greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `t` is a positive integer greater than 2

The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `stdin`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is a substring of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases**
