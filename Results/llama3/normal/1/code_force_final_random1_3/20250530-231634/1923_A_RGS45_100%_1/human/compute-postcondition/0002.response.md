Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains t - 2 test cases**

The code snippet reads two lines from stdin for each test case, assigning the first line to `n` and the second line to `arr`. The `find` method is used to locate the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` from the start and end, assigning the indices to `x` and `y` respectively. The substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` is then assigned to `z`. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged.
