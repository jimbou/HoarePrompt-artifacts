Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains t - 3 test cases**

The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin, assigning the first line to `n` and the second line to `arr`. The value of `n` is an integer, and the value of `arr` is a string. The third line finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` and assigns it to `x`. The fourth line finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reverse of `arr` and assigns it to `y`. The fifth line extracts a substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n - y`, and assigns it to `z`. The number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z` of `arr` is being printed. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `_` remains 1. The value of `stdin` is reduced by 2 test cases.
