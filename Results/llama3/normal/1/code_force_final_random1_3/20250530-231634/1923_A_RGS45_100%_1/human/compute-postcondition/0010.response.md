Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, stdin contains t - 4 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains the same, which is 2. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `arr` is updated to a string of characters read from the input, with all whitespace characters removed. The value of `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr`. The value of `y` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the reversed string `arr`. The value of `z` is updated to a substring of `arr`, starting from the index `x` and ending at the index `n - y`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, as two inputs are read from `stdin` during the execution of the code.
