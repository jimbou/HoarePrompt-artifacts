Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of `s` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of the first character in `s` have been replaced by the last character in `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from the original `s` in ascending order, `i` is 0, `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars`, and `char` is the first character in the original `s` and it is also present in `unique_chars`. Otherwise, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `s` in ascending order and contains the first character of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is the index of the last character in `unique_chars` plus one, and `char` is the first character in `s`.***
