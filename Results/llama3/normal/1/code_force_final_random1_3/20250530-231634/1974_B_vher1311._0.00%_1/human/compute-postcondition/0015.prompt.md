Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from s in ascending order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char in unique_chars:
        s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
        j -= 1
    else:
        unique_chars.insert(i, char)
        i += 1
        j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of `s` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of the first character in `s` have been replaced by the last character in `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from the original `s` in ascending order, `i` is 0, `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars`, and `char` is the first character in the original `s` and it is also present in `unique_chars`. Otherwise, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `s` in ascending order and contains the first character of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is the index of the last character in `unique_chars` plus one, and `char` is the first character in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the second character in `s`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from the original `s` in ascending order, `i` is 0, `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` if `char` is in `unique_chars`. Otherwise, `unique_chars` has `char` inserted at the beginning, `i` is 1, and `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters. If the third character `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced by the second last character in `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` remains a list of unique characters from the original `s` in ascending order, `i` is 0, and `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` minus 1. Otherwise, `char` is inserted at the beginning of `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
