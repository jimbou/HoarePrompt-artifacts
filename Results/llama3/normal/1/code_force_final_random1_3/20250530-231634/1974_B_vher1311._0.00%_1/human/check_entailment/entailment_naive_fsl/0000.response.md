Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, specifically in the way it replaces characters in the string `s`. The function uses the `replace` method, which replaces all occurrences of a character in the string, not just the first one. This can lead to incorrect results when there are duplicate characters in the string.

For example, consider the input string "aab". The function will replace the first 'a' with the last character in the `unique_chars` list, say 'b'. Then, it will replace the second 'a' with the second last character in the `unique_chars` list, say 'a'. However, this will also replace the first 'a' again, resulting in an incorrect output.

A correct approach would be to iterate through the string `s` and replace each character with its corresponding character in the `unique_chars` list, without using the `replace` method. This can be done by using a dictionary to map each character in `s` to its corresponding character in `unique_chars`, and then using this dictionary to replace the characters in `s`.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    char_map = {char: unique_chars[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    return ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)
```
This implementation correctly replaces each character in the string `s` with its corresponding character in the `unique_chars` list, without using the `replace` method.
