Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1(b)` is supposed to decode the encoded string `b` and return the original string `s`. However, the function is not correctly implemented.

The function first creates a list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the encoded string `b` and replaces each character with the corresponding character from the list of unique characters. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not correctly reverse the encoding process.

The correct approach would be to create a mapping between the characters in the encoded string `b` and the characters in the list of unique characters, and then use this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with the corresponding character from the original string `s`.

Moreover, the function returns a string consisting of unique characters from the original string `s` in ascending order, which is not the correct output. The correct output should be the decoded string `s`.

Correctness: **False**
