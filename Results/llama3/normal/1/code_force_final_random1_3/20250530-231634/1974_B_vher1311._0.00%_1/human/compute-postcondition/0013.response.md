Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, char is the third character in s, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original s in ascending order with char inserted at the beginning, i is 1, j is the index of the second last character in unique_chars plus 1.**

In this output state, the string `s` remains unchanged, and `char` is still the third character in `s`. The list `unique_chars` now has `char` inserted at the beginning, and the index `i` has been incremented to 1. The index `j` has also been incremented by 1, pointing to the new second last character in `unique_chars`.
