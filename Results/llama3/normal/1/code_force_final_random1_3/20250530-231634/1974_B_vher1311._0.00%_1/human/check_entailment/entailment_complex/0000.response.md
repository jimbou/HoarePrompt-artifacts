Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the encoded string `b` and return the original string `s`. However, the function does not perform the decoding correctly.

The function first creates a list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the encoded string `b` and replaces each character with the corresponding character from the end of the list of unique characters. However, this is not the correct decoding process.

The correct decoding process would be to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with the corresponding character from the beginning of the list of unique characters, not the end. This is because the encoding process replaced each character in the original string `s` with the corresponding character from the end of the list of unique characters.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
