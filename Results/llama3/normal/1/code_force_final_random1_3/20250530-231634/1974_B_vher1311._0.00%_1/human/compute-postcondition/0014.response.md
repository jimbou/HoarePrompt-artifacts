Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters. If the third character `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced by the second last character in `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` remains a list of unique characters from the original `s` in ascending order, `i` is 0, and `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` minus 1. Otherwise, `char` is inserted at the beginning of `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` plus 1.***
