Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the second character in `s`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from the original `s` in ascending order, `i` is 0, `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` if `char` is in `unique_chars`. Otherwise, `unique_chars` has `char` inserted at the beginning, `i` is 1, and `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` plus 1.***
