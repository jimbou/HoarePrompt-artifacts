#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original s in ascending order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars, and char is the last character in the original s.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string consisting of unique characters from the original string s in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns a string consisting of unique characters from the original string in ascending order. The function replaces each character in the original string with a unique character from the end of the sorted list of unique characters, and inserts non-unique characters into the sorted list while maintaining its order. The function ultimately returns a string of unique characters in ascending order, effectively sorting and removing duplicates from the original string.
