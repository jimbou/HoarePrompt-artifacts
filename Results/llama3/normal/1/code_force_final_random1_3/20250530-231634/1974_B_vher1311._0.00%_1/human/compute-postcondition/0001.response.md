According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `s` in ascending order, `i` is 0, and `j` is the index of the last character in `unique_chars`. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least 1 character and `char` is the first character in `s`. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `s` in ascending order, `i` is 0, `j` is the index of the last character in `unique_chars`, `char` is the first character in `s`**
