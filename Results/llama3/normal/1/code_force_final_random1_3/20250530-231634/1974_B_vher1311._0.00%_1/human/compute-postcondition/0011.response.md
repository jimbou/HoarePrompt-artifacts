To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `for char in s:`. The only variable in the loop head is `char` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, `char` is the second character in `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `char` must be the third character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the third character in `s`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from the original `s` in ascending order, `i` is 0, `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` if `char` is in `unique_chars`. Otherwise, `unique_chars` has `char` inserted at the beginning, `i` is 1, and `j` is the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` plus 1.**
