This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns a string consisting of unique characters from the original string in ascending order. The function replaces each character in the original string with a unique character from the end of the sorted list of unique characters, and inserts non-unique characters into the sorted list while maintaining its order. The function ultimately returns a string of unique characters in ascending order, effectively sorting and removing duplicates from the original string.
