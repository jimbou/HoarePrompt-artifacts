Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect. The problem requires decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm, which involves replacing each character with its symmetric character from a string of distinct letters in alphabetical order. However, the provided program does not perform this decoding operation.

Instead, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a string consisting of unique characters from the original string in ascending order. This function replaces each character in the original string with a unique character from the end of the sorted list of unique characters, and inserts non-unique characters into the sorted list while maintaining its order. The function ultimately returns a string of unique characters in ascending order, effectively sorting and removing duplicates from the original string.

However, this is not the correct decoding operation. The correct decoding operation would involve replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the original string, using the symmetric property of the encoding algorithm.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
