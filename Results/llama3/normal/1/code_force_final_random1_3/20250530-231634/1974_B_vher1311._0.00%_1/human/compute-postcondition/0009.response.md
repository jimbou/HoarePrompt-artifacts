Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, char is the second character in s, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original s in ascending order with char inserted at the beginning, i is 1, j is the index of the second last character in unique_chars plus 1**

Explanation:
The first line inserts `char` at the beginning of `unique_chars`. Since `char` is the second character in `s`, it is now the first element in `unique_chars`. The second line increments `i` by 1, making it 1. The third line increments `j` by 1, making it the index of the second last character in `unique_chars` plus 1. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and `char` remains the second character in `s`.
