Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `s` in ascending order and contains the first character of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is the index of the last character in `unique_chars` plus one, and `char` is the first character in `s`**.

The code modifies the `unique_chars` list by inserting the first character of `s` at index `i`, which is initially 0. This means the first character of `s` is now included in `unique_chars`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `j` is also incremented by 1, making it the index of the last character in `unique_chars` plus one. The value of `char` remains the same, which is the first character in `s`. The string `s` remains unchanged.
