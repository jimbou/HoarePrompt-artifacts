Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is -2 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0), otherwise the value at index `i` is -1 for all `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is 1, if the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0) and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `curr` is 2, otherwise `curr` is 1, `ans` is 0.***
