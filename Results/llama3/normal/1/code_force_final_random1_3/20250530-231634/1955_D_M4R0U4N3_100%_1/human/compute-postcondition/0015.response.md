The value of `curr` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr` was 0, so the new value of `curr` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one less than its previous value, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0, and `curr` is 1. The current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
