Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `stdin` is empty, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is -1 and the value at index `i` is 0 for all other `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is 0, `curr` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique positive integers `b_values` but its count in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b` at index `a[i]` is decreased by 1, since `a[i]` is in the set of unique positive integers `b_values`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
