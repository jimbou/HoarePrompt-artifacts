Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[i]` is the number of times `b[i]` appears in list `b` and all other values are 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `m`**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `cnt_b` at each index `b[i]` will be the count of how many times `b[i]` appears in the list `b`. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `m`, which is the number of iterations the loop executed. All other variables remain unchanged.
