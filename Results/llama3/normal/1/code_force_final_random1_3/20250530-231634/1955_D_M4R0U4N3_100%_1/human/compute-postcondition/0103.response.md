The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is -2 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0), otherwise the value at index `i` is -1 for all `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is 2, if the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0) and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `curr` is 2, otherwise `curr` is 1, `ans` is 0**
