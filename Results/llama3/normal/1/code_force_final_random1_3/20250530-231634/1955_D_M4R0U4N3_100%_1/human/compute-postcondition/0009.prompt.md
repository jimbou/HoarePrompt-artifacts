Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, b is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    cnt_b[b[i]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[0]` is 1 and all other values are 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[0]` is 2 and the value at index `b[1]` is 1 and all other values are 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[0]` is 2, the value at index `b[1]` is 1, the value at index `b[2]` is 1 and all other values are 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
