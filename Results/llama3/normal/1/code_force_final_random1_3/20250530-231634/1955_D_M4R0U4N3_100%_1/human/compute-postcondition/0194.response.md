Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers, `i` is within the range of 0 to `n - m - 1`, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is -1, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `curr` is `m` if all elements of `a` are in `b_values` and the count of each element in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is less than `m`, and `n - m` is at least 1. The current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
