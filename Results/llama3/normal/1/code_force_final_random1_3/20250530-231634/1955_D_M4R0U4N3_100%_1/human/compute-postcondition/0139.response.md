The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n` and `m`. If `i` is less than `n-m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m+1`, `n` is greater than `m+1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-1`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `m+2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `m+2` and `m` must be less than `n-2`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than `m+2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is `-m-1` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `m+2`. If the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `a[i+m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i+m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.**
