Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one less than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is `m-1`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0, and `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The maximum value `max_val` remains unchanged at 1000000.
*   The count list `cnt_b` is updated such that the value at index `a[i]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
*   The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values` retain their initial values as they are not affected by the loop.
*   The variable `m` is a positive integer representing the number of iterations.
*   The variable `i` is `m-1` after the loop completes.
*   The variable `ans` remains 0 as it is not updated in the loop.
*   The variable `curr` is the total count of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.
