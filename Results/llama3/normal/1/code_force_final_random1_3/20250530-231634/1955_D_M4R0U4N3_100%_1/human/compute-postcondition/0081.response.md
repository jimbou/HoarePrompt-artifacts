The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the input is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input must be greater than 0.
State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `i` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains input, `i` is the last value in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged, and ans is printed, where ans is either `n-m+1` if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`.**
