Output State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of positive integers from the second input, `b` is a list of positive integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is -m-1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is -m if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is `m-1`, `ans` is 0, and `curr` is 1, and `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`. The count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `curr` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
