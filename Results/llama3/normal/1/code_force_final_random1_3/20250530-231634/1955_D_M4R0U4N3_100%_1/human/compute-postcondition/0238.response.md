The only object in the loop head is variable  `i` and set `b_values`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `b_values`.  If the set has at least one more element the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, `b_values` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `b_values`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set must have at least one more element and the `i` is the next element in `b_values`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers that has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i-1]` is -1, `cnt_b[b[i-1]]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution.**
