The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined based on the value of `curr` and the conditions specified in the initial state.

`curr` is calculated as the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`. Otherwise, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`.

If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `b_values` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `n-m+1` or `n-m`, depending on the value of `curr` and the conditions specified.

Output: **n-m+1 if curr is greater than or equal to k, otherwise n-m**
