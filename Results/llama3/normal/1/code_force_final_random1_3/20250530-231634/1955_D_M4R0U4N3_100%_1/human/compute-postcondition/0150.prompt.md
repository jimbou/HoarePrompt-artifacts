Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0), otherwise the value at index `i` is `-m+1` for all `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `m-1`, `curr` is `m` if the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0) and `a[i]` is in `b_values` for all `i` in range `m`, otherwise `curr` is less than `m`. If the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `i` is `-m+1` for all `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous value of `ans`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, then the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m+1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is `-m-1` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `m+1`. If the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `a[i+m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i+m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer and greater than `m+2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is `-m-1` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `m+2`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, the state of `cnt_b` and `curr` remains unchanged. If `a[i+m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i+m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `cnt_b` and `curr` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
