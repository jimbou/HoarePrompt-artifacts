Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is `-m-1` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `n-1`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, the state of `cnt_b` and `curr` remains unchanged. If `a[i+m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i+m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `cnt_b` and `curr` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The loop iterates `n-m` times, where `n` is the length of list `a` and `m` is a non-negative integer less than `n`.
*   The list `cnt_b` keeps track of the count of each element in list `a` that is also in list `b`. If an element is not in `b`, its count is `-m`. If an element is in `b` and its count is greater than 0, its count is `-m-1`.
*   The variable `curr` is used to keep track of the current count of elements in `a` that are also in `b`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.
*   In each iteration, if `a[i]` is in `b`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b`, the state of `cnt_b` and `curr` remains unchanged.
*   If `a[i+m]` is in `b`, the value at index `a[i+m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `cnt_b` and `curr` remains unchanged.
*   After the loop finishes, `i` is `n-1`, and the final value of `ans` is determined based on the value of `curr`.
