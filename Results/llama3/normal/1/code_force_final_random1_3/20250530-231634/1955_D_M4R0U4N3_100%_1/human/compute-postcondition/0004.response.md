The code increments the value of `cnt_b` at the index `b[i]` by 1. Since `i` is 0, the value of `cnt_b` at the index `b[0]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[0]` is 1 and all other values are 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0**
