The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 1 and less than n, `k` is a positive integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of positive integers from the second input, `b` is a list of positive integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index a[i] is -m if a[i] is not in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is 0, otherwise the value at index a[i] is -m-1 if a[i] is in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is greater than 0, and the value at index a[m+1] is increased by 1 if a[m+1] is in b_values and the count of a[m+1] in cnt_b is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index a[m+1] remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list b, `i` is 1, and `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 1, and `cnt_b[b[i]]` is 1, stdin contains no input**
