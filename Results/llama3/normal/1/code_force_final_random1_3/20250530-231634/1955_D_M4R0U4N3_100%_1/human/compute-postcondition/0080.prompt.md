Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `n-m` more than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains the same, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is `n-m-1`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged, and ans is printed, where ans is either `n-m+1` if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is `n-m-1`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b` that is not empty, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged, and ans is printed, where ans is either `n-m+1` if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`, `i` is the first value in `b_values`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is the second value in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b` that has at least 2 values, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged, and ans is printed, where ans is either `n-m+1` if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is the third value in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b` that has at least 3 values, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged, and ans is printed, where ans is either `n-m+1` if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
