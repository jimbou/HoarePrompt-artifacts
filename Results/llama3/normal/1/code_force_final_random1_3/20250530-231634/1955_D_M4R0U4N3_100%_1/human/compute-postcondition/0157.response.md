To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in b_values:`, so we can only adjust the state of `i` and `b_values`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `b_values`. If `b_values` has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `b_values` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `b_values`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `b_values` must have at least 3 elements and `i` is the third element in `b_values`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is `-m-1` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0**
