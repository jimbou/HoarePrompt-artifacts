Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is 2. If the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0) and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is -3, `curr` is 3, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is -1 and `curr` is 2. `ans` is 0.***
