Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, b is a list of positive integers, stdin is empty, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index i is 0 for all i in b_values, b_values is a set of unique positive integers from list b, i is m-1, curr is 0, ans is 0**

The code snippet has the following effects on the program state:

*   The first line, `b_values = set(b)`, creates a set of unique positive integers from list `b` and assigns it to `b_values`. This does not change the values of `b` or any other variables.
*   The second line, `ans = 0`, resets the value of `ans` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `ans`, which was either `n-m+1` or `n-m`.
*   The third line, `curr = 0`, resets the value of `curr` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `curr`, which was the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` was the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`.

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of `ans` and `curr` as modified by the code.
