Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `b[0]` is 2 and the value at index `b[1]` is 1 and all other values are 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[b[1]]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
