To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the set `b_values`. The loop will execute if `b_values` is not empty. Since `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, and `b` is a list of positive integers, we can adjust the state of `b` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is `-m-1` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b` that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `n-1`**
