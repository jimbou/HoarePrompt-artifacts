Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than `m+2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is `-m-1` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `m+2`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, the state of `cnt_b` and `curr` remains unchanged. The value at index `a[i+m]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value at index `a[i+m]` in `cnt_b` has been decreased by 1. This means that if `a[i+m]` was in `b_values` and its count in `cnt_b` was greater than 0, its count has now decreased by 1. If `a[i+m]` was not in `b_values` or its count in `cnt_b` was 0, the state of `cnt_b` remains unchanged.
