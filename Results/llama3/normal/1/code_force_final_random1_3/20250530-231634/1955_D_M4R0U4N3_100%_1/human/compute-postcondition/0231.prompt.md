Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of positive integers from the second input, `b` is a list of positive integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is -m-1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is -m if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `m-1`, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is -1, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `curr` is `m` if all elements of `a` are in `b_values` and the count of each element in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is less than `m`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers, `i` is within the range of 0 to `n - m - 1`, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is -1, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is 0, `ans` is 2 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is `m` if all elements of `a` are in `b_values` and the count of each element in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is less than `m`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers, `i` is within the range of 1 to `n - m`, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i-1]` is -1, `cnt_b[b[i-1]]` is 0, `ans` is 3 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2. If `a[i-1]` is in `b_values`, then if `cnt_b[a[i-1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is `m - 1` if all elements of `a` are in `b_values` and the count of each element in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is less than `m`. If `cnt_b[a[i-1]]` is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i-1]` is not in `b_values`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i + m - 1]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers, `i` is within the range of 2 to `n - m`, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i-1]` is -1, `cnt_b[b[i-1]]` is 0. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 3. The state of the variables `a[i-1]`, `a[i + m - 1]`, `a[i + m]`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` remains unchanged if `a[i-1]` is not in `b_values` or if `cnt_b[a[i-1]]` is not greater than 0. If `a[i-1]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i-1]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is `m - 1` if all elements of `a` are in `b_values` and the count of each element in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is less than `m`. If `a[i + m - 1]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
