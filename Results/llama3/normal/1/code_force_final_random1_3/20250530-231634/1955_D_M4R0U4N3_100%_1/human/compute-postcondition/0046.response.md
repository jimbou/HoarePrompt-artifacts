Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one more than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains the same, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus one if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `ans` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ans` being 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
