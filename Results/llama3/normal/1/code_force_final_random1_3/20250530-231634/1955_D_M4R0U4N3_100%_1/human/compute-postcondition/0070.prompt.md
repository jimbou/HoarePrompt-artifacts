Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one less than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is `m-1`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, and `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one more than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains the same, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus one if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is two more than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains the same, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus one if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 1 and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus two if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 1 and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus one. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one more than its previous value if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus two if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 1 and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus one. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 2. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
