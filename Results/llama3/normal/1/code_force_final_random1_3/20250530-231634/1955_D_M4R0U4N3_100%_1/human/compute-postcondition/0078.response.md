Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is the third value in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b` that has at least 3 values, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged, and ans is printed, where ans is either `n-m+1` if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`.**

The code `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value at index `i` in the list `cnt_b` to 0. Since `i` is the third value in `b_values`, this means that the value at index `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
