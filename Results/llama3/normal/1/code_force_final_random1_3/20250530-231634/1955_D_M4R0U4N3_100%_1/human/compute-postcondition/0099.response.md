The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` was -1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise the value at index `i` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`. So the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is now -2 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise the value at index `i` is -1 for all `i` in `b_values`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is -2 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise the value at index `i` is -1 for all `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is 1, `curr` is 1 if the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0) and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is 0, `ans` is 0**
