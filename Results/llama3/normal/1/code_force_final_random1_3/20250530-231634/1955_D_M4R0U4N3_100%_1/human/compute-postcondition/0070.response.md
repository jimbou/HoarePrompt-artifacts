Output State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `n-m` more than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains the same, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is `n-m-1`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n-m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `max_val` remains unchanged at 1000000.
* The list `cnt_b` has been updated such that the value at index `a[i]` is `n-m` more than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains the same.
* The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.
* The value of `i` has been updated to `n-m-1`.
* The value of `curr` has been updated to the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise it is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`.
* If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `n-m+1`, otherwise it is `n-m`.
* The value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.
* If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.
* If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged.
* If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged.
