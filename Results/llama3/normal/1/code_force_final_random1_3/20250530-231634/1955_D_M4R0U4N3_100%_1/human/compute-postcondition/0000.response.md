Output State: **max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros**.

In this output state, `max_val` is assigned the value of 1000000, and `cnt_b` is initialized as a list of 1000001 zeros, with indices ranging from 0 to 1000000. The state of stdin remains unchanged, as the code does not interact with it.
