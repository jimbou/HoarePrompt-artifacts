This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k. The second line contains n integers, and the third line contains m integers. The function then calculates the number of times a subarray of length m in the first array contains at least k elements from the second array. The function prints the result for each test case.
