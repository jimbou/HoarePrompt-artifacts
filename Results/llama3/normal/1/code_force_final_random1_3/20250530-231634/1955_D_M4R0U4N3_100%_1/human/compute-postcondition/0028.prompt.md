Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index b[i] is the number of times b[i] appears in list b and all other values are 0, n is a positive integer, m is 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, b is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, i is 0, b_values is a set of unique positive integers from list b, ans is 0, curr is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one less than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0, and `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one less than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0, and `curr` is 2 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one less than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is 3 and the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` but `cnt_b[a[i]]` is less than 0, then `curr` is 2. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `curr` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
