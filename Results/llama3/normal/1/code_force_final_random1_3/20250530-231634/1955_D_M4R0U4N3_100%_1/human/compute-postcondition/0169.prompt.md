Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer equal to the first input, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, k is a positive integer equal to the third input, a is a list of positive integers from the second input, b is a list of positive integers from the third input, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index a[i] is -m if a[i] is not in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is 0, otherwise the value at index a[i] is -m-1 if a[i] is in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is greater than 0, and the value at index a[m+1] is increased by 1 if a[m+1] is in b_values and the count of a[m+1] in cnt_b is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index a[m+1] remains the same, b_values is a set of unique positive integers from list b, i is the last element in b_values, and cnt_b[n-1] is 0, and cnt_b[i] is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    cnt_b[b[i]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 0 and less than n, `k` is a positive integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of positive integers from the second input, `b` is a list of positive integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index a[i] is -m if a[i] is not in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is 0, otherwise the value at index a[i] is -m-1 if a[i] is in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is greater than 0, and the value at index a[m+1] is increased by 1 if a[m+1] is in b_values and the count of a[m+1] in cnt_b is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index a[m+1] remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list b, `i` is 0, and `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 1, and `cnt_b[b[i]]` is 1, stdin contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 1 and less than n, `k` is a positive integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of positive integers from the second input, `b` is a list of positive integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index a[i] is -m if a[i] is not in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is 0, otherwise the value at index a[i] is -m-1 if a[i] is in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is greater than 0, and the value at index a[m+1] is increased by 1 if a[m+1] is in b_values and the count of a[m+1] in cnt_b is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index a[m+1] remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list b, `i` is 1, and `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 1, and `cnt_b[b[i]]` is 2, stdin contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 2 and less than n, `k` is a positive integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of positive integers from the second input, `b` is a list of positive integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index a[i] is -m if a[i] is not in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is 0, otherwise the value at index a[i] is -m-1 if a[i] is in b_values and the count of a[i] in cnt_b is greater than 0, and the value at index a[m+1] is increased by 1 if a[m+1] is in b_values and the count of a[m+1] in cnt_b is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index a[m+1] remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list b, `i` is 2, and `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i]` is 1, and `cnt_b[b[i]]` is 3, stdin contains no input




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
