Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m+1` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0), otherwise the value at index `i` is `-m+1` for all `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `m`, `curr` is `m` if the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0) and `a[i]` is in `b_values` for all `i` in range `m`, otherwise `curr` is less than `m`. If the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1. The current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0.***
