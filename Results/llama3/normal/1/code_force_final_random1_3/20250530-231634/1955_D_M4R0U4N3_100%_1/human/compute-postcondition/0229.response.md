Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers, `i` is within the range of 2 to `n - m`, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i-1]` is -1, `cnt_b[b[i-1]]` is 0, `ans` is 4 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 3. If `a[i-1]` is in `b_values`, then if `cnt_b[a[i-1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is `m - 1` if all elements of `a` are in `b_values` and the count of each element in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is less than `m`. If `cnt_b[a[i-1]]` is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i-1]` is not in `b_values`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i + m - 1]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The value of `ans` is increased by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is now 4, otherwise `ans` is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
