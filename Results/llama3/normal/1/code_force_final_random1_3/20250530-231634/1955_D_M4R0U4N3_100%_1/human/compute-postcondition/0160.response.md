State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers that must have at least `len(b)+1` elements, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is not in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is 0, otherwise the value at index `a[i]` is `-m-1` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, and the value at index `a[m+1]` is increased by 1 if `a[m+1]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[m+1]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `a[m+1]` remains the same, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b` that must have at least `len(b)+1` elements, `i` is the last element in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0**
