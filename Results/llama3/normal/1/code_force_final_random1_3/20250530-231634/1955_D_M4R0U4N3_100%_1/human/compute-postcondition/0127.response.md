Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is `-m` if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, otherwise the value at index `i` is `-m+1` for all `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is `m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous value of `ans`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is greater than 0, then the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
