Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `stdin` is empty, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `i` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `i` is 0, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m-1` if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than `n-m-1` and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus `n-m`, `ans` is either `n-m+1` if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n-m`, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[b[0]]` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the count of `b[0]` in the `cnt_b` list has been increased. The other variables remain unchanged.
