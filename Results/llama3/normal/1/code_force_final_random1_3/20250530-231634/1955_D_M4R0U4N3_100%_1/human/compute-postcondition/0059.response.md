To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, and `m` is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `m` remain the same.

State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is two more than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains the same, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus one if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 1 and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus two if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 1 and `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, otherwise `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus one. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value at index `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is one less than its previous value. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is less than 0, then `cnt_b` remains unchanged.**
