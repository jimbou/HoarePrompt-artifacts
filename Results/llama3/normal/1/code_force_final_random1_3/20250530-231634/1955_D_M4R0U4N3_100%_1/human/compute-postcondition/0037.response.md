Postcondition: ***`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one more than its previous value, `n` is a positive integer and greater than `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, and `curr` is the number of times `a[i]` is in `b_values` minus one if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, otherwise `curr` remains the same. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. The current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`.***
