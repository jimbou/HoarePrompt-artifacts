To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is a positive integer, so the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `int(input())` must be a positive integer**
