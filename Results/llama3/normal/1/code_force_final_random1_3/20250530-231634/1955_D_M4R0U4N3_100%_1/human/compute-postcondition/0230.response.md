Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers, `i` is within the range of 2 to `n - m`, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i-1]` is -1, `cnt_b[b[i-1]]` is 0. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 3. The state of the variables `a[i-1]`, `a[i + m - 1]`, `a[i + m]`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` remains unchanged if `a[i-1]` is not in `b_values` or if `cnt_b[a[i-1]]` is not greater than 0. If `a[i-1]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i-1]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is `m - 1` if all elements of `a` are in `b_values` and the count of each element in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is less than `m`. If `a[i + m - 1]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m - 1]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0.***
