Postcondition: ***`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index `a[i]` is one less than its previous value if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `curr` is 3 and the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `curr` is 2.***
