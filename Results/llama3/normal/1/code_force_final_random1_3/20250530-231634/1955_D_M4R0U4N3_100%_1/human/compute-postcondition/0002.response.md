Output State: **max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers, b is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input.**

The code first reads three positive integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Then, it reads two lists of positive integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. After executing the code, `max_val` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged, while `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are assigned new values. The input is fully consumed, leaving stdin empty.
