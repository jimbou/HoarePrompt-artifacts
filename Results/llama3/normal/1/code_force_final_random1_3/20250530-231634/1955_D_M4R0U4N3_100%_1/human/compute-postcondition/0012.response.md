Postcondition: **`max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the value at index b[i] is the number of times b[i] appears in list b and all other values are 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, stdin contains no input, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers from list b, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique positive integers from list b (`b_values`).**
