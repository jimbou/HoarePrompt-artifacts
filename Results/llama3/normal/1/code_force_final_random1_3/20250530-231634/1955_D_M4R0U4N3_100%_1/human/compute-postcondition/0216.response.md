Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `b` is a list of positive integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, `b_values` is a set of unique positive integers, `i` is within the range of 1 to `n - m`, `cnt_b[n-1]` is 0, `cnt_b[i-1]` is -1, `cnt_b[b[i-1]]` is 0, `ans` is 2 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
