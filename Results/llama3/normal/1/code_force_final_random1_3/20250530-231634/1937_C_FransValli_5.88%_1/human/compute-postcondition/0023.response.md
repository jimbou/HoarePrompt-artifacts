To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 1 (since the range starts from 1). 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is a string, `best` is 0, stdin is empty**
