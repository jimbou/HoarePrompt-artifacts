To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, which is at least 3.

The other variables, `k` and `res`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not affect the loop's execution. The state of `stdin` is also not relevant to the loop's execution.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 1, `res` is '? 0 1 0 2', stdin is empty. If `res` is '<', then `k` is updated to 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
