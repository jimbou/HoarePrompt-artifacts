Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is either 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by either 0 or 1 which is `best`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by 2 which is `i` and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to 2 and the print statement is updated accordingly.***
