Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is either 1 or 2, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is either '<' or remains unchanged, and the stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is updated to be the input from the user, which is either '<' or remains unchanged. The value of `k` is still either 1 or 2, and the value of `best` is still the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since the input has been read.
