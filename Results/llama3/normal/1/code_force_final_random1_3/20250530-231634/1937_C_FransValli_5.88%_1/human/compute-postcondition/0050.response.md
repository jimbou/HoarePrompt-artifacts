Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is updated to contain the input string. The value of `best` is still the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'. The printed output remains the same.
