Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 1, and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`), and this is printed: '?'  [k] [best] [k] [i], and `res` is a string containing the input from stdin. The current value of `res` is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the printed statements and the value of `res` are still the same as in the initial state.
