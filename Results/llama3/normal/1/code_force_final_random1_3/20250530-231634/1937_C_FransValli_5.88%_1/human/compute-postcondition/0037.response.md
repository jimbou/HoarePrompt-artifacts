The code prints a string containing a question mark '?' followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `best` which is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `i` which is 3.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 3 (where k is at least 1 and best is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of res)**
