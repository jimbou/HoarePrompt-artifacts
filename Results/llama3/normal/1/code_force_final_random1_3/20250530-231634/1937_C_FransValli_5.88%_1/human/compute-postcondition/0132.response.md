Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is n-1, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is n-1. Otherwise, `best` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains at least `n`, `i` is now `n-1`, `k` is still either 1, 2, 3, ..., or `n-2`, and `res` can be either '<', '=', or '>'. The value of `best` depends on the value of `res`: if `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`, otherwise, `best` is one of the values from 1 to `n-2`. Additionally, the loop has printed a series of '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is `n-1`, and the stdin contains no input.
