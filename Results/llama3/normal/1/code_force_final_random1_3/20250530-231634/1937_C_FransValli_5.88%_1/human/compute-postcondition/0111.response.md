Output State: **n is at least n, i is n-1, k is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-1, best is the maximum value of i for which res is '<', res is either '<' or remains unchanged, and the stdin contains no input. If res is '<', then k is n-1. Otherwise, k remains either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, `i` is now `n-1`, and `k` is either the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' (which is `n-1` if `res` is '<') or remains one of its previous values (1, 2, 3, ..., or `n-2` if `res` is not '<'). The value of `best` remains the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and `res` is either '<' or remains unchanged. The stdin contains no input.
