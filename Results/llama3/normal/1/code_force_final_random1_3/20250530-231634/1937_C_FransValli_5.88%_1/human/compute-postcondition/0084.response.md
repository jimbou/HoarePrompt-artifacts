Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is either 0, 1 or 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by either 0, 1 or 2 which is `best`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by 3 which is `i`, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to contain the input from the user, and the values of the other variables remain the same. The print statement has been executed, displaying the specified values. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
