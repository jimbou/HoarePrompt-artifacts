Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input '? 0 1 0 2', and the current value of `res` is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still at least 3, `i` is still 2, `best` is still the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and `res` is still a string containing the input '? 0 1 0 2' with a current value of '<'.
