Output: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is either 1 or 2, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input '? 0 1 0 2', and the current value of `res` is either '<' or remains unchanged. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2, otherwise `k` is 1. The following string is printed: '?' followed by 0, then the value of `k` which is either 1 or 2, then 0, then the value of `i` which is 3**
