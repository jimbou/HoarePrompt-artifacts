Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 0, and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`).**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `best` has been reset to 0, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still at least `n`, `i` is still `n`, `k` is still the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and `res` is still a string containing the input. Additionally, the same print statements have been executed, printing '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`).
