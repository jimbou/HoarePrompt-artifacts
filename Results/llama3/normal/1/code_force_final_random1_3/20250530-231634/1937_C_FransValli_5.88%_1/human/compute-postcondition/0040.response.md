Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is at least 1, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 3, and stdin is empty, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `best` which is 3, followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and `res` is assigned the value of the input.**

Explanation: The value of `best` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The print statement still prints the same values, but now `best` is 3 instead of 1 or 2.
