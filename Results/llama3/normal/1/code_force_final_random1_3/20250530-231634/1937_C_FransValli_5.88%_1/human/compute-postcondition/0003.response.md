Based on the precondition, the variables `n`, `i`, and `k` have specific values before the print statement is executed. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

* `n` is at least 3, but its exact value is not specified.
* `i` is 2.
* `k` is 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```
Now, let's analyze the output:

* The first argument is a string literal `'?'`, which will be printed as is.
* The second argument is an integer literal `0`, which will be printed as is.
* The third argument is the value of `k`, which is 1.
* The fourth argument is another integer literal `0`, which will be printed as is.
* The fifth argument is the value of `i`, which is 2.

Since `flush=True` is used, the output will be printed immediately without buffering.

Output: **? 0 1 0 2**
