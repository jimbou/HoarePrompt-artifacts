Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases). Each test case contains one input: an integer (the size of the permutation).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and stdin is empty, and this is printed: '!', k which is n-1, best which is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`), and this is printed: '?'  [k] [best] [k] [i] for all `i` in range(1, `n`), and this is printed: '!' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `best`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is n-1, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is n-1. Otherwise, `best` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is n-1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
