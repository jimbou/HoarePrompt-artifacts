To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(2, n):`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 2, it will increment by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is at least 3
* `i` is 2
* `k` is 1
* `res` is a string containing the input
* `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'
* Printed output: '?' 0 1 0 2

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we only need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Since `i` is currently 2, it will increment to 3 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, which is 3.

The other variables (`k`, `res`, and `best`) are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is 1, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'**
