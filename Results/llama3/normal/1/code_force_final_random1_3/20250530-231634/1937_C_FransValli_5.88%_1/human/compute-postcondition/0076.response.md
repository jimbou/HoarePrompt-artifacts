The code prints a string containing a question mark, the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', either 0 or 1, the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and 2, and it does so without buffering the output.
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 2 (where k is the maximum value of i for which res is '<', and best is either 0 or 1)**
