Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', `best` is either 1 or 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is 2, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2.**
