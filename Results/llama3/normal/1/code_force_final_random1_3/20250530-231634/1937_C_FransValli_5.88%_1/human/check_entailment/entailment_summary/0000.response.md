Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find any two indices i and j such that p_i âŠ• p_j is maximized. The program first finds the largest element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current largest element. Then, it finds the second-largest element by comparing each element with the current largest element, excluding the largest element itself. Finally, it prints the indices of the largest and second-largest elements.

The program uses the bitwise OR operation to compare elements, which is a valid approach according to the problem description. It also ensures that the number of queries does not exceed 3n, which is the maximum allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
