The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', `best` is either 1 or 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is 3, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2.**
