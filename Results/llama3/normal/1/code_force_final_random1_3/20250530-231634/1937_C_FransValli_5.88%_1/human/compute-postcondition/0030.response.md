To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, since `k` is defined as `n-1`, we need to update its value accordingly. If `n` is greater than 2, then `k` becomes `n-1`, which is at least 1.

The other variables, `res`, `best`, and stdin, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 0, and stdin is empty.**
