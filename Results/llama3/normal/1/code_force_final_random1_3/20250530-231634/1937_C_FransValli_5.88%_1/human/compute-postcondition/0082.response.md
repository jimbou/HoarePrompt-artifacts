The code prints a string that starts with '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by either 0, 1 or 2 which is `best`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by 3 which is `i`. Since `res` is '<', `best` is updated to 2. Therefore, the print statement will output '?' followed by `k`, 2, `k`, and `i`. 

Since `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' and `i` is 3, `k` is also 3. 

Output: **? 3 2 3 3**
