Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 0, and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`), and this is printed: '?'  [k] [best] [k] [i], and `res` is a string containing the input from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 2, `i` is still 1, `k` is still the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `best` is still 0, and the same print statements have been executed. The only change is that `res` now contains the input from stdin, which is a string.
