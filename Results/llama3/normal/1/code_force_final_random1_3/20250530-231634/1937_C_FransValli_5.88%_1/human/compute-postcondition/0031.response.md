The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i`, followed by a flush operation to ensure the output is displayed immediately.

Since `k` is at least 1, `best` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`, and `i` is 2, the output will be a string with these values inserted.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 2 (where k is at least 1, best is 0 or 1 depending on the value of res, and i is 2)**
