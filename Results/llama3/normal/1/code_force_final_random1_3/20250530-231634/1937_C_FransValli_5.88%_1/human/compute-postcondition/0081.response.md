The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is either 0, 1 or 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by either 0, 1 or 2 which is `best`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by 3 which is `i` and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to 2 and the print statement is updated accordingly.**
