Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 0, and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        best = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is either 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`), and this is printed: '?'  [k] [best] [k] [i], and `res` is a string containing the input from stdin. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1, otherwise `best` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is either 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by either 0 or 1 which is `best`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by 2 which is `i` and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to 2 and the print statement is updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, if `res` is '<', then `best` is 3, otherwise `best` is either 0, 1 or 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by either 0, 1 or 2 which is `best`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by 3 which is `i`, and stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
