Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The outer loop iterates over each test case.
2. The first inner loop finds the index k such that p_k is the maximum among all p_i (0 <= i < n). This is done by comparing p_0 with each p_i (2 <= i < n) and updating k if p_i is greater than p_0.
3. The second inner loop finds the index best such that p_best is the maximum among all p_i (1 <= i < n) and p_k XOR p_best is maximized. This is done by comparing p_k with each p_i (1 <= i < n) and updating best if p_i is greater than p_k.
4. Finally, the program prints the indices k and best, which are the indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted and the program correctly handles the input and output.

Correctness: **True**
