Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 2, and stdin is empty, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `best` which is 2, followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `i` which is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `k`, `res`, and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `best` is updated to 2, which is the value of `i`. The stdin is still empty, and the same values are printed as in the initial state, but with the updated value of `best` which is now 2.
