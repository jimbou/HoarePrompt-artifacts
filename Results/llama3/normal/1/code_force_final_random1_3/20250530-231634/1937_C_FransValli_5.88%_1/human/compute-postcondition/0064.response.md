Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `k` is 4, `res` is a string containing the newly input string, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 4**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 4, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still at least 5, `i` is still 4, `res` still contains the newly input string, and `best` is still the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'. The printed output remains the same: ? 0 1 0 4.
