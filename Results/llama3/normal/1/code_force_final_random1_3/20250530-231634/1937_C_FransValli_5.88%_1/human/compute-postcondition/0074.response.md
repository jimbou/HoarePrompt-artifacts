Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is either 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`), and this is printed: '?'  [k] [best] [k] [i], and `res` is a string containing the input from stdin. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1, otherwise `best` is 0.***
