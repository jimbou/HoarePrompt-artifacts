Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 0, and stdin is empty, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `best` which is either 0 or 1, followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `i` which is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `best` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `res` is updated to be the input string. The stdin is empty, and the specified string is printed.
