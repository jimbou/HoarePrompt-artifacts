The code prints a string containing a question mark, followed by a space, then the number 0, another space, the value of `k`, another space, the number 0, another space, and finally the value of `i`. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately displayed.

Since `k` can be 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is 4, the output will be one of the following:

- If `k` is 1, the output will be: **? 0 1 0 4**
- If `k` is 2, the output will be: **? 0 2 0 4**
- If `k` is 3, the output will be: **? 0 3 0 4**

However, since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can't determine the exact output. But we can describe it as:

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 4 (where k is 1, 2, or 3)**
