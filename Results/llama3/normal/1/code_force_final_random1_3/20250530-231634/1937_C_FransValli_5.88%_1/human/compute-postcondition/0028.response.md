Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is a string containing the input '<', `best` is 1, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still at least 2, `i` is still 1, `k` is still `n-1`, and `res` still contains the input '<'. The stdin is still empty.
