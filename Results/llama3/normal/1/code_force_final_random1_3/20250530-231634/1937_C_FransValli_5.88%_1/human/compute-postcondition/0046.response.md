The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was at least 2, the new value of `n` is also at least 2. The second line assigns the value 1 to `k`. This overwrites the previous value of `k`, which was `n-1`. The value of `i` is not affected by the code and remains `n`. The value of `res` is also not affected and remains a string containing the input. The value of `best` is not affected and remains the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'. Stdin is now empty after the first line.

Output State: **n is at least 2, i is n, k is 1, res is a string containing the input, best is the maximum value of i for which res is '<'.**
