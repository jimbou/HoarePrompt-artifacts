Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input '? 0 1 0 2', `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `best` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The value of `res` is updated to contain the input string '? 0 1 0 2'. The `stdin` remains empty as it was initially.
