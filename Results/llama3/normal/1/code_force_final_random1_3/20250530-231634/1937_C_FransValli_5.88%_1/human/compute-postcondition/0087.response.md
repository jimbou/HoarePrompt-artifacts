Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`), and this is printed: '?'  [k] [best] [k] [i] for all `i` in range(1, `n`).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and the print statements are updated accordingly. The print statements include '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `best`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by `i` for all `i` in range(1, `n`).
