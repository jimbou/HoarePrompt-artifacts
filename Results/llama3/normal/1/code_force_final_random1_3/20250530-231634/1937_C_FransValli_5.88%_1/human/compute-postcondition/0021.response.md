Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is a string that was in stdin which is now empty, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final values. The value of `n` is still at least 2, as it was in the initial state. The value of `i` is now `n-1`, which is the last value it took in the loop. The value of `k` is also `n-1`, which is the last value it was updated to in the loop. The value of `res` is a string that was in stdin, which is now empty. The stdin is empty, as all the input has been consumed by the loop.
