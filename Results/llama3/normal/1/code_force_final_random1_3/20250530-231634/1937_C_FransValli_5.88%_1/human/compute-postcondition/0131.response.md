Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is 3, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 3. Otherwise, `best` is either 1 or 2.***
