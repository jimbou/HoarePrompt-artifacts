Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 1 or 2, `res` is '? 0 1 0 3' or '<', stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is either 1 or 2, depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `k` is updated to 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The value of `res` is either '? 0 1 0 3' or '<', which is the input from the user. The other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged.
