Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `best` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '>'**

The value of `res` is updated to either '<' or '>', which is accepted from the input. The stdin contains no input. The values of the other variables are not affected. If `res` is '<', then `k` is n-1. Otherwise, `k` remains either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2.
