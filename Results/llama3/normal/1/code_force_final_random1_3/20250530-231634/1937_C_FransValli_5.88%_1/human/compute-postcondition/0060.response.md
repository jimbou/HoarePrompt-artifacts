The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `k` is 1, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 3. If `res` is '<', then `k` is updated to 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
