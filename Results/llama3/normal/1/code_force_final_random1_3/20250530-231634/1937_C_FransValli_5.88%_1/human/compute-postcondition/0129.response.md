Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', `best` is either 1 or 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is 3, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to either '<', '=', or '>', which was previously unknown. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `best` remain the same as in the initial state. The print statement has been executed, displaying the specified values. Since stdin contains no input, it is not included in the output state.
