To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `stdin`. If there is another input in `stdin`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must not be empty.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and stdin is not empty**
