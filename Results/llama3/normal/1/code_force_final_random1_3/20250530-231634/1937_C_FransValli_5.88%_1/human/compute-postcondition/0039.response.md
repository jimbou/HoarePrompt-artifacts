Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is at least 1, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 1 if `res` is not '<', and stdin is empty, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `best` which is either 1 or 2, followed by the value of `k` which is at least 1, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and `res` is assigned the value of the input.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `best` remain the same as before, but `res` is now assigned the value of the input. The stdin is empty, and the specified string is printed. The value of `best` depends on the value of `res`, which is either 1 or 2.
