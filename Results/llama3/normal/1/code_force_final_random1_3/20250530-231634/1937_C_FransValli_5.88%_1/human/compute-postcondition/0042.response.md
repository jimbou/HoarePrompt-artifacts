Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, the value of `k` will remain `n-1`, the value of `res` will be the input string, and the value of `best` will be the maximum value of `i` for which the input string `res` is '<'. The state of `n` and stdin remains unchanged.
