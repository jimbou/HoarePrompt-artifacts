Output State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `best` is 0, `res` is either '<' or remains unchanged, and the stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `k` is n-1. Otherwise, `k` remains either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `res` and `k` is still valid, meaning that if `res` is '<', then `k` is n-1, and if `res` is not '<', then `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2. The stdin still contains no input.
