The code prints a string containing a question mark, followed by a space, then the value of `0`, another space, the value of `k` which is `1`, another space, the value of `0`, another space, and finally the value of `i` which is `2`. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately displayed on the console without buffering.

Output: **? 0 1 0 2**
