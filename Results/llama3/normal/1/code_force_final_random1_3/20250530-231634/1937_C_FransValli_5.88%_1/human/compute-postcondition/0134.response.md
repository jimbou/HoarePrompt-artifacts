Output: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is n-1, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is n-1. Otherwise, `best` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is n-1.**
