Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by either 0 or 1 which is not `best` anymore, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by 2 which is `i` and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The printed output remains the same, but the value of `best` is now 2, which is the value of `i`.
