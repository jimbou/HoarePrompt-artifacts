The code prints a string containing a question mark, 0, the value of k, 0, and the value of i, followed by a flush operation to ensure the output is displayed immediately.

Since k is either 1 or 2, and i is 3, the output will be one of the following two possibilities:

If k is 1, the output will be: ?, 0, 1, 0, 3
If k is 2, the output will be: ?, 0, 2, 0, 3

Output: **?, 0, [k], 0, 3 (where k is either 1 or 2)**
