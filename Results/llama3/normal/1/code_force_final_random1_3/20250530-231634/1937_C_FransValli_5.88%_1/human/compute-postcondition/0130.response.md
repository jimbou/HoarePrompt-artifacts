Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', `best` is 3, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is 3, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition "If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2" is still valid, but since `best` is now 3, this condition is not applicable. The print statement has been executed, displaying the values of `k`, `best`, `k` again, and `i`. The stdin remains empty.
