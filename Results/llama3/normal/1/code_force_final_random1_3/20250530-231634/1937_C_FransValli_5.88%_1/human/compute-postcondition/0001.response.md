Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is 1, stdin is empty**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since the input is guaranteed to be greater than 0, `n` becomes a positive integer. This line also consumes the input from stdin, leaving it empty. The second line assigns the value 1 to `k`. No other variables are affected.
