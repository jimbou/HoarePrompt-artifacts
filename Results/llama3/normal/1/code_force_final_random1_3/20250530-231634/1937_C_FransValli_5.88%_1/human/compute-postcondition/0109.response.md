Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `k` is 4, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is either '<' or remains unchanged, and the stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 4, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty, and the printed output remains the same. The value of `res` is either '<' or remains unchanged, depending on the input.
