According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is 1, and `res` is a string containing the input, and `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3, and `i` must be 2.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'**
