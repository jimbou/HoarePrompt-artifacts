This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case represents the size of a permutation. For each test case, it iteratively queries the permutation to find the second-largest element and then prints the indices of the largest and second-largest elements in the format '!, k, best'. The function repeats this process for all test cases until standard input is empty.
