Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is 3, and this is printed: '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by either 0, 1 or 2 which is `best` which is 3, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by 3 which is `i`, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `best` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the printed output remains the same.
