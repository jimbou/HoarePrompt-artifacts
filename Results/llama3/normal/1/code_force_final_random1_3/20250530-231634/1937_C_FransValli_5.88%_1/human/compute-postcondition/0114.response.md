The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i`. 

Since `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, or n-1 (when `res` is '<'), and `best` is 0, and `i` is 1, the print statement will output a string with these values.

Output: **? [k] 0 [k] 1 (where k is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, or n-1)**
