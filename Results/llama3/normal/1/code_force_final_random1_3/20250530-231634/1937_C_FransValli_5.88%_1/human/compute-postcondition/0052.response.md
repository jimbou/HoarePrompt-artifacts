Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `res` is a string containing the input '<', `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 2**

The value of `k` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is the same as the initial state, except that `k` is now 2.
