To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 2 and goes up to but does not include `n`). Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which does not guarantee the loop will execute, so we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3 and `i` to be 2 (the starting value of the range).

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `stdin` is empty**
