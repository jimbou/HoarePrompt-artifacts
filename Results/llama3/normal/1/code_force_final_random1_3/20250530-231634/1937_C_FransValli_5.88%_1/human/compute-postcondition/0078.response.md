Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is either 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k`, followed by either 0 or 1 which is `best`, followed by the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<' which is `k` again, followed by 2 which is `i` and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to contain the input from the user, and the value of `k` is still the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'. The values of `n`, `i`, and `best` remain unchanged. The print statement has been executed, displaying the specified output.
