Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `k` is either 1, 2, or 3, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is either '<' or remains unchanged, and the stdin contains no input, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values 0, k (which is either 1, 2, or 3), 0, and i (which is 4), and `res` is assigned the value from the input which is either '<' or remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 5, `i` is still 4, `k` is still either 1, 2, or 3, `best` is still the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is either '<' or remains unchanged, and the stdin contains no input. Additionally, the value of `res` is updated to the input value which is either '<' or remains unchanged. The print statement has been executed, displaying '?' followed by the values 0, k (which is either 1, 2, or 3), 0, and i (which is 4).
