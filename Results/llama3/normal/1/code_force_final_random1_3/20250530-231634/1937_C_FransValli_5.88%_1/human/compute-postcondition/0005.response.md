Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `res` is '? 0 1 0 2', stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `res` is assigned the value '? 0 1 0 2', which is the input read from the standard input. Since the standard input is empty, there is no more input to read.
