Output: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, `best` is 0, `res` is either '<' or remains unchanged, and the stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `k` is n-1. Otherwise, `k` remains either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, followed by the value of `best` which is 0, followed by the value of `k` which is either 1, 2, 3, ..., or n-2, followed by the value of `i` which is 1**
