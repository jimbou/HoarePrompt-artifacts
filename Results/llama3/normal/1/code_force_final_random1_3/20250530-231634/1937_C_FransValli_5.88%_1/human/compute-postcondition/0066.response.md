Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `best` is the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<', and this is printed: '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in range(2, `n`).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains the same, `i` is now equal to `n`, `k` is updated to the maximum value of `i` for which the input `res` is '<', `res` contains the latest input string, and `best` remains the maximum value of `i` for which `res` is '<'. Additionally, the loop has printed '?' 0 1 0 `i` for all `i` in the range from 2 to `n`.
