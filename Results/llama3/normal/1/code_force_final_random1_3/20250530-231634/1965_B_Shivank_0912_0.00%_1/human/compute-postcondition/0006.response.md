Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `n` and `k` are the third pair of integers in the list, `results` is a list containing three tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The `results` list has been updated to include a new tuple `(25, sequence)`, which is identical to the existing tuples in the list. The `sequence` list remains the same, containing 25 integers that are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.
