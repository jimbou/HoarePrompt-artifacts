Functionality: This function generates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence of 25 integers that are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The function takes a positive integer 't' and a list of pairs of positive integers 'cases' as input, but it does not use the values of 'cases' in its computation. The function returns a list of 't' tuples, regardless of the input 'cases'. The input variables 't' and 'cases' are not modified by the function.
