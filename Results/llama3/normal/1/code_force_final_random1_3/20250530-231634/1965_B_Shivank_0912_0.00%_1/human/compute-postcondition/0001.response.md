To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `n` and `k` in the tuple `(n, k)`, and the list `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cases` list. If the list has at least 1 pair of integers, the loop can execute.

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `cases` must have at least 1 pair of integers, and `n` and `k` are the first pair of integers in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers that must have at least 1 pair, `n` and `k` are the first pair of integers in the list, `results` is an empty list, `sequence` is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24**
