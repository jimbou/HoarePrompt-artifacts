Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, results is an empty list, sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `cases` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code initializes an empty list `results` and a list `sequence` containing 25 integers, each being a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.
