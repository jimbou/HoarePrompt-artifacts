To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for (n, k) in cases:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `n`, `k`, and `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cases` list. If the list has at least 3 pairs of integers, the loop can execute again for the third time.

At the end of the last iteration, `cases` has at least 2 pairs of integers, `n` and `k` are the second pair of integers in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `cases` must have at least 3 pairs of integers, and `n` and `k` should be the third pair of integers in the list.

The other variables `t`, `results`, and `sequence` are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `n` and `k` are the third pair of integers in the list, `results` is a list containing two tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24**
