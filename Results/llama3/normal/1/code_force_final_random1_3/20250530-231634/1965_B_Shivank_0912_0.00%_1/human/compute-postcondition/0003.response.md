To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cases`, `n`, and `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cases` list. If the list has at least 2 pairs of integers, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cases` has at least 1 pair of integers, `n` and `k` are the first pair of integers in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `cases` list must have at least 2 pairs of integers, and `n` and `k` must be the second pair of integers in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `n` and `k` are the second pair of integers in the list, `results` is a list containing one tuple (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24**
