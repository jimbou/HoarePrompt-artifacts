Functionality: **The function generates a list of 't' tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence of 25 integers that are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, regardless of the input list of cases. The input list of cases is not modified or used in any way. The function always returns a list of 't' tuples with the same sequence of powers of 2, where 't' is a positive integer.**
