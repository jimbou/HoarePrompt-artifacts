Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `n` and `k` are the second pair of integers in the list, `results` is a list containing two tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include another tuple (25, sequence), in addition to the existing one. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
