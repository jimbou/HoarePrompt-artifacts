Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` always returns a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence of 25 integers that are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, regardless of the input list of cases. This means that the function does not take into account the values of `n` and `k` in each case, which are crucial for determining the correct sequence.

The problem requires finding a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, and for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`. The function does not attempt to solve this problem and instead returns a fixed sequence of powers of 2.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
