Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the last pair of integers in the list, `results` is a list containing `t` tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer, the list `cases` becomes empty because all its pairs have been processed, the variables `n` and `k` hold the values of the last pair of integers in the list, the list `results` contains `t` number of tuples, each tuple being (25, sequence), and the list `sequence` remains unchanged with its 25 integers being powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.
