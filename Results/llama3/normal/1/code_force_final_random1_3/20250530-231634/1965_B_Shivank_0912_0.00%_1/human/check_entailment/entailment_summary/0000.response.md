Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` generates a list of 't' tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence of 25 integers that are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, regardless of the input list of cases. However, the problem requires finding a sequence 'a' of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence of 'a' with a sum of 'k', and for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence of 'a' with a sum of 'v'. The generated sequence of powers of 2 does not guarantee these conditions.

For example, if n = 6 and k = 1, the generated sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216] does not satisfy the condition that there is no subsequence with a sum of 1, because the subsequence [1] has a sum of 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
