#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the last pair of integers in the list, `results` is a list containing `t` tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of 't' tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence of 25 integers that are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list of 't' tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence of 25 integers that are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, regardless of the input list of cases. The input list of cases is not modified or used in any way. The function always returns a list of 't' tuples with the same sequence of powers of 2, where 't' is a positive integer.
