Output State: **The program returns a list of 't' tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence of 25 integers that are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.**

In this output state, the value of 't' is a positive integer, and the list 'results' contains 't' number of tuples. Each tuple in the 'results' list has two elements: the number 25 and a sequence of 25 integers. The sequence of integers is a list of powers of 2, ranging from 2^0 to 2^24.
