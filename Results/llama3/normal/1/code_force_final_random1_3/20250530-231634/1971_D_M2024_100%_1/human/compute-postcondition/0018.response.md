Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 4 characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 0, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, `cut0` is incremented by 1, If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cut0` and `cut1` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 1 and 500, `a` is still a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 with at least 4 characters, `stdin` still contains `t-1` strings of characters 0 and 1, `_` is still 0, and `i` is still an integer incremented by 1. The condition for `cut1` remains the same, depending on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`.
