Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is at least 3, `cut0` is increased by 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 500, `a` still being a string of at least 4 characters consisting of 0s and 1s, `i` still being at least 3, and the stdin still containing `t-2` strings of 0s and 1s. The condition for `cut1` remains the same, incrementing by 1 if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0'.
