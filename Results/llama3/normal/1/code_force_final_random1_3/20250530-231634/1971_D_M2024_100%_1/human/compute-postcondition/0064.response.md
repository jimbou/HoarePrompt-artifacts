The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` must have at least 2 characters. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must have at least 3 characters.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1 and `_` is 2. Otherwise, the values of `cut0`, `cut1`, and `_` remain unchanged.**
