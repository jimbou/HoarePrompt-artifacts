Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is either 2 or the previous value of `cut1` plus 1, `cut0` is either 1 or remains unchanged, and `_` is either 2 or remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `cut0`, `cut1`, and `_` remain unchanged.***
