Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 0, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, `cut0` is incremented by 1, If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
