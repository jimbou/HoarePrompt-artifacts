To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) - 1 characters, `stdin` contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 1, `i` is an integer equal to len(a) - 1**
