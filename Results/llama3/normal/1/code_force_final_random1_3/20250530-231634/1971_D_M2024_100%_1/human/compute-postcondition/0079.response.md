The code prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`, where `cut0` is the total number of times '0' is followed by '1' in string `a` and `cut1` is the total number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string `a`.

Output: **sum of cut0 and cut1 (where cut0 is the total number of times '0' is followed by '1' in string a and cut1 is the total number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string a)**
