Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 2 characters, `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. The current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut1` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The string `a` still consists of characters 0 and 1, with at least 2 characters, and the current values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` are still '1' and '0', respectively. The number of strings in `stdin` remains `t-3`, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.
