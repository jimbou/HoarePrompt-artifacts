Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is at least 2, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is increased by 1 and `cut1` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `cut0` and `cut1` remains unchanged.***
