The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) characters, `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is len(a) - 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If `cut0` is 0, the value of `cut1 + 1` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of `cut0` and `cut1` is printed.**
