Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) - 1 characters, cut0 is 0, cut1 is 0, _ is 1, i is an integer equal to len(a) - 1, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.**

The first line assigns a string from stdin to `a`, making `a` a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) - 1 characters. The second and third lines initialize `cut0` and `cut1` to 0. The fourth line does not affect any variables. The fifth line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
