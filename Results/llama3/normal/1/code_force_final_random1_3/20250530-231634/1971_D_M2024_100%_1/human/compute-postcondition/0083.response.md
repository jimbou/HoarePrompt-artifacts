Functionality: **The function reads a series of strings from standard input, each consisting of characters '0' and '1', and for each string, it counts the number of times '0' is followed by '1' and '1' is followed by '0'. If a string contains no instances of '0' followed by '1', it prints the number of times '1' is followed by '0' plus one. Otherwise, it prints the total number of both instances. The function processes multiple strings as specified by an initial integer input.**
