Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 4 characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 0, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, `cut0` is incremented by 0, `cut1` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `cut0` and `cut1` are still dependent on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`, but since `cut1` has been incremented, it means that the condition `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0' has been met at least once.
