The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `a` must have at least 4 characters.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 4 characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 0, `i` is an integer incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is incremented by 1.**
