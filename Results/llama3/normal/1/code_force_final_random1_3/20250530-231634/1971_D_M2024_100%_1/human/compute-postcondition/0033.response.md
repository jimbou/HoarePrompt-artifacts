Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 2 characters, `cut0` is 0, `i` is at least 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1 and `_` is 1. Otherwise, `cut1` and `_` remain unchanged.***
