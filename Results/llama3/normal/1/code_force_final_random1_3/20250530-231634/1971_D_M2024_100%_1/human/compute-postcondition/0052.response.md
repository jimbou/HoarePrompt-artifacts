The code prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`. `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in string `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string `a`. Since `cut0` is not equal to 0, it means that there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in string `a`. However, the exact value of `cut0` and `cut1` cannot be determined without knowing the exact string `a`.

Output: **the sum of cut0 and cut1 (where cut0 is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in string a, and cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string a)**
