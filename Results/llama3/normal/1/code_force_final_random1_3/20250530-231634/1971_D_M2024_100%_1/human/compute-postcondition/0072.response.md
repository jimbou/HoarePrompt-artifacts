Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `cut0` is either 3 or the previous value of `cut0` plus 1, `cut1` is either 3 or the previous value of `cut1`, and `_` is either 2 or the previous value of `_`, and `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `cut1`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.
