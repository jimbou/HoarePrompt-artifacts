Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) - 1 characters, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, _ is 0, i is an integer equal to len(a) - 1. The current value of cut0 is 0, meaning '0' is never followed by '1' in string a, and cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string a.**
