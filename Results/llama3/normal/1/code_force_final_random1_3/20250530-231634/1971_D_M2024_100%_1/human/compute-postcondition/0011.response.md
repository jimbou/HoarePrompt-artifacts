Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 0, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, `cut1` is incremented by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut1` is increased by 1, while the values of `t`, `a`, `stdin`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
