Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) characters, `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is len(a) - 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `cut0` and `cut1` will be incremented by the number of times '0' is followed by '1' and '1' is followed by '0' in string `a`, respectively. The value of `i` will be the last index of string `a`. The values of `t`, `_`, and stdin remain unchanged.
