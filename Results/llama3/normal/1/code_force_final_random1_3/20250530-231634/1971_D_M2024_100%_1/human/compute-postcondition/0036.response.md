Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is at least 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1. If `a[i]` was '1' and `a[i + 1]` was '0' before this condition, then `cut1` is 1 and `_` is 1, otherwise, `cut1` and `_` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is not '0' or `a[i + 1]` is not '1', then `cut0` remains 0.***
