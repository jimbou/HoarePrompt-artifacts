Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a = input()
    cut0 = 0
    cut1 = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
            cut1 += 1
        if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
            cut0 += 1
    if cut0 == 0:
        print(cut1 + 1)
    else:
        print(cut0 + cut1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) - 1 characters, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, _ is 0, i is an integer equal to len(a) - 1. If '0' is never followed by '1' in string a, then the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string a plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, the total number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' or a '1' is followed by a '0' in string a is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) characters, `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is len(a) - 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If `cut0` is 0, the value of `cut1 + 1` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of `cut0` and `cut1` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) characters, cut0 is the total number of times '0' is followed by '1' in a, cut1 is the total number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a, _ is 2, i is len(a) - 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If cut0 is 0, the value of cut1 + 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of cut0 and cut1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
