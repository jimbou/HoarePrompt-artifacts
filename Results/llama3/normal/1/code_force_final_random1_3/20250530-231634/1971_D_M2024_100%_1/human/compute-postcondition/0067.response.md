Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 1, `cut0` is either 2 or the previous value of `cut0` plus 1, `cut1` is either 2 or the previous value of `cut1`, and `_` is either 2 or the previous value of `_`, and `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is either 2 or the previous value of `cut1` plus 1, and `_` is either 2 or remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, and its new value is either 2 or the previous value of `cut0` plus 1. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `cut1`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the condition for `cut1` and `_` still depends on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`. The input in `stdin` remains the same.
