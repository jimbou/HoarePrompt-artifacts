Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is at least 2, `cut0` is increased by 1, `cut1` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut0` is increased by 1. The value of `cut1` remains the same unless `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', in which case it is increased by 1. All other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
