The code prints the value of `cut1` plus 1, where `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string `a`. Since the exact string `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cut1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `cut1` plus 1.
Output: **cut1 + 1 (where cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string a)**
