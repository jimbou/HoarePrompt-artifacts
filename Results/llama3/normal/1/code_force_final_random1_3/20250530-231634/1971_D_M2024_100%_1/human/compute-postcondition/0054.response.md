Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) characters, `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, `_` is 1, `i` is len(a) - 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If `cut0` is 0, the value of `cut1 + 1` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of `cut0` and `cut1` is printed.**
