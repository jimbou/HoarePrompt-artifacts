Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, cut0 is 0, cut1 is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
        cut1 += 1
    if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
        cut0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, _ is 0, i is an integer. If the character at index i in string a is '0' and the character at index i+1 in string a is '1', then cut0 is 1. Otherwise, cut0 remains 0. If the character at index i in string a is '1' and the character at index i+1 in string a is '0', then cut1 is 1. Otherwise, cut1 remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 0, `i` is an integer incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 4 characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 0, `i` is an integer incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cut0` and `cut1` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
