Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through each character in the string, counting the number of times '0' is followed by '1' (cut0) and '1' is followed by '0' (cut1). If there are no instances of '0' followed by '1', it means the string is already sorted or can be sorted by cutting at the '1's, so it prints cut1 + 1. Otherwise, it prints the total number of both instances, which represents the minimum number of pieces needed to sort the string.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the string is already sorted (cut0 and cut1 are both 0) or when the string contains only one character (cut0 and cut1 are both 0).

Correctness: **True**
