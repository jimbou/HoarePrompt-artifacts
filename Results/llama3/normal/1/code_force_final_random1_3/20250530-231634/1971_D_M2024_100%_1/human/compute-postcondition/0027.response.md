Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) - 1 characters, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, _ is 0, i is an integer equal to len(a) - 1. If '0' is never followed by '1' in string a, then the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string a plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, the total number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' or a '1' is followed by a '0' in string a is printed.**
