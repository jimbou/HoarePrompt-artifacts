Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 2 characters, `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. The current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut1` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The stdin still contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. The current values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` are still '1' and '0', respectively.
