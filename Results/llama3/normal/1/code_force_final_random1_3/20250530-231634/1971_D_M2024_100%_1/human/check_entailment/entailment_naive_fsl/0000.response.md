Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through the string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' (cut1) and the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' (cut0). If cut0 is 0, it means that the string is already sorted in the order '1's followed by '0's, so the minimum number of pieces needed is cut1 + 1. Otherwise, the minimum number of pieces needed is cut0 + cut1.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. For example, if the string is already sorted, cut0 and cut1 will both be 0, and the program will output 1, which is correct. If the string is not sorted, the program will output the correct minimum number of pieces needed to sort it.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
