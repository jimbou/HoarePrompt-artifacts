Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is at least 3, `cut1` is increased by 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The input buffer still contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.
