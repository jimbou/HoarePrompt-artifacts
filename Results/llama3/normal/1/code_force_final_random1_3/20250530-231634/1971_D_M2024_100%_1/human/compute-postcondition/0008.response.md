Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 2 characters, `cut0` is 1, stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 0, `i` is an integer. The character at index `i` in string `a` is '0' and the character at index `i+1` in string `a` is '1'. If the character at index `i` in string `a` is '1' and the character at index `i+1` in string `a` is '0', then `cut1` is 1. Otherwise, `cut1` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
