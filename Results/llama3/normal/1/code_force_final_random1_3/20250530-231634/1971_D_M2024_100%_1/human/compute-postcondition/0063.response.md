Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1 and `_` is 2. Otherwise, the values of `cut0`, `cut1`, and `_` remain unchanged.***
