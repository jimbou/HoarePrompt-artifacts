Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 2 characters, `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1, `_` is 0, `i` is an integer such that the character at index `i` in string `a` is '1' and the character at index `i+1` in string `a` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut1` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The string `a` still consists of characters 0 and 1, with at least 2 characters, and the character at index `i` is '1' and the character at index `i+1` is '0'. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.
