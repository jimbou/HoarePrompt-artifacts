Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), a is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least len(a) characters, cut0 is the total number of times '0' is followed by '1' in a, cut1 is the total number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a, _ is 2, i is len(a) - 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains unchanged, the string `a` remains unchanged, the variable `cut0` will be the total number of times '0' is followed by '1' in the string `a`, the variable `cut1` will be the total number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`, the variable `_` remains unchanged at 2, the variable `i` will be the last index of the string `a`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
