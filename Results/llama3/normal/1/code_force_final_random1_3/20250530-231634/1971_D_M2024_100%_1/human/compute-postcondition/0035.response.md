Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1 that must have at least 2 characters, `cut0` is 1, `i` is at least 1, stdin contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters 0 and 1. The current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1'. If `a[i]` was '1' and `a[i + 1]` was '0' before this condition, then `cut1` is 1 and `_` is 1, otherwise, `cut1` and `_` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut0` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `a`, `i`, and the contents of stdin. Additionally, the conditions regarding `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, `cut1`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state.
