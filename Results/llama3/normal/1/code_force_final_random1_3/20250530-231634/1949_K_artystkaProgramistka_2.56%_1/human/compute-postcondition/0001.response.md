To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If the list has at least 1 number, the loop executes. Since the list is sorted in descending order, the first number is the largest. So, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 number and `num` is the largest number in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers in descending order that must have at least 1 number, `num` is the largest number in the list, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are 0**
