Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-2` positive integers in descending order, `num` is the next largest integer not in the list, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with one element each, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are positive integers such that `sum_a` + `sum_b` + `sum_c` = `num`.**

In this output state, the `distribute_number(num)` function has been executed, which has distributed the number `num` into the three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. The sum of the elements in each group is now positive, and the total sum of the elements in all three groups is equal to `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.
