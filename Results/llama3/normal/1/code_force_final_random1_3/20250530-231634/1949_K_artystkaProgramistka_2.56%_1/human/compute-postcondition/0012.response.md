Functionality: **This function takes a list of positive integers and three positive integers (na, nb, nc) as input, where na + nb + nc equals the length of the list. It sorts the list in descending order and distributes the numbers into three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) with na, nb, and nc elements respectively. The function then checks a condition (func_1) based on the sums of these groups (sum_a, sum_b, sum_c). If the condition is true, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups. If the condition is false, it returns 'NO'.**
