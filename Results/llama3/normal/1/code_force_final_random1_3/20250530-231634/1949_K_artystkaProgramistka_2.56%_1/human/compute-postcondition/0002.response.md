Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-1` positive integers in descending order, `num` is not in the list, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with one element which is `num`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are `num`**

In this output state, the function `distribute_number(num)` has been executed, which has removed the largest number `num` from the list `numbers` and added it to one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`). The sum of each group has been updated to `num`. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged.
