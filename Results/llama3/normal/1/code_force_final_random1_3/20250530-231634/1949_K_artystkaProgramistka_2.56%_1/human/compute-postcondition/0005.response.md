To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `numbers`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-2` positive integers in descending order, and `num` is the next largest integer not in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `numbers` must have at least one more element, and `num` must be the next largest integer in the list. Since the list is sorted in descending order, the next largest integer is the one that is smaller than the current `num`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-3` positive integers in descending order, `num` is the next largest integer in the list, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with one element each, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are positive integers such that `sum_a` + `sum_b` + `sum_c` = `num`**
