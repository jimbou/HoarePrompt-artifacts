The code sorts the list of numbers in descending order and initializes three empty groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) and three sum variables (sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) to zero. 

Output State: **n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, numbers is a sorted list of n positive integers in descending order, group_a, group_b, and group_c are empty lists, sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are 0**
