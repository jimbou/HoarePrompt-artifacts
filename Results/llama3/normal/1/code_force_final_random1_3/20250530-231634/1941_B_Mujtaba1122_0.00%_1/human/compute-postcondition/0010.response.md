Output State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, and the element at index `i+1` is greater than 0 and less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `list` and `n >= 4`, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the third element of `list` is 0 because the first line of the code sets `list[i - 1]` to 0. The fourth element of `list` is less than its original value because the second line of the code subtracts 2 times the original value of the third element from the fourth element. The element at index `i+1` is less than its original value because the third line of the code subtracts the original value of the third element from the element at index `i+1`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
