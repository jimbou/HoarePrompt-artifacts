#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: The program returns False if any element of the list is not 0, otherwise it continues execution. `i` is `n`, `n` must be less than or equal to `len(list)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list are 0, and the value of `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is less than or equal to the length of the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if the first n elements of a list are all zeros. Returns False as soon as it encounters a non-zero element, otherwise returns True if all elements up to the nth index are zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, n is a positive integer such that n is equal to the length of list and n >= 3.
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

    #State: list is a list of non-negative integers where the first n-2 elements are 0, the second last element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, and the last element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 3, i is n-2

    #State: *list is a list of non-negative integers where the first n-2 elements are 0, the second last element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, and the last element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 3, i is n-2. If func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies a list of non-negative integers by iteratively subtracting values from the first n-2 elements, the second last element, and the last element, based on certain conditions. It then checks the modified list using the func_1 function and prints 'YES' if the function returns True, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value but modifies the input list in-place and prints a message to the console.
