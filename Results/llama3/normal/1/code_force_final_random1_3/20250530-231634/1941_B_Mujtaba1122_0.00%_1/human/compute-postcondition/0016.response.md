To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head based on the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given loop statement:
```
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, and the element at index `i+1` is greater than 0 and less than its original value.
- `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `list` and `n >= 4`.
- `i` is 2.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop condition `i in range(1, n - 1)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, it must be incremented to 3 for the loop to execute again. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the loop iteration.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, and the element at index `i+1` (which is now the fifth element) is greater than 0 and less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `list` and `n >= 4`, `i` is 3**
