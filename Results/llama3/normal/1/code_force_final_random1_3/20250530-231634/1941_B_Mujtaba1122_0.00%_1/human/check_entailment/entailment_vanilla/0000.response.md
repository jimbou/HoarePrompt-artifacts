Reasoning:

The given program is trying to solve the problem by using two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero. 

`func_2` tries to make all elements in the list zero by applying the given operation. It does this by iterating over the list and applying the operation as long as the current element is greater than 1 and the previous and next elements are greater than 0. 

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The operation is not applied correctly. The operation should subtract 1 from the previous element, 2 from the current element, and 1 from the next element. But in the program, the operation is applied as `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, which is not correct.

2. The program does not check if the first or last element is zero. The operation can only be applied to elements in the middle of the list (i.e., elements with index greater than 0 and less than n-1). If the first or last element is not zero, it cannot be made zero by applying the operation.

3. The program does not handle the case where the list has less than 3 elements. In this case, the operation cannot be applied at all.

4. The program does not handle the case where the list has only one or two non-zero elements. In this case, the operation cannot be applied to make all elements zero.

5. The program does not handle the case where the list has negative elements. The problem statement does not specify what should happen in this case, but the program will not work correctly if the list contains negative elements.

6. The program does not handle the case where the list is empty. The problem statement does not specify what should happen in this case, but the program will not work correctly if the list is empty.

7. The program does not handle the case where the input is not a list of integers. The problem statement does not specify what should happen in this case, but the program will not work correctly if the input is not a list of integers.

8. The program does not handle the case where the input list is not valid (for example, if it contains non-integer values, or if it is not a list at all). The problem statement does not specify what should happen in this case, but the program will not work correctly if the input list is not valid.

9. The program does not handle the case where the number of test cases is not a positive integer. The problem statement does not specify what should happen in this case, but the program will not work correctly if the number of test cases is not a positive integer.

10. The program does not handle the case where the number of elements in the list is not a positive integer. The problem statement does not specify what should happen in this case, but the program will not work correctly if the number of elements in the list is not a positive integer.

Correctness: **False**
