To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n - 1`. Since `n` is already given as a positive integer and equal to the length of the list, we can conclude that the list must have at least 3 elements.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be 1, as specified in the range.

So, the adjusted state is:

State: **list is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1**
