The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of list and `n` >= 3. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 0, the element at index i-1 is 0, the element at index i is 0, the element at index i+1 is greater than 0, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 4, i is 2**
