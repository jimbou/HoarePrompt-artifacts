Output State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, and the element at index `i+1` is greater than 0 and less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `list` and `n >= 4`, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the third element of the list is now 0, and the fourth element is still greater than 0 but less than its original value. The first and second elements remain unchanged. The value of `n` and `i` also remains the same.
