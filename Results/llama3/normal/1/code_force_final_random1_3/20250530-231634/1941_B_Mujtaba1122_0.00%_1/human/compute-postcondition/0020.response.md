Output State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 1 and equal to its original value minus 2 times the original value of the third element, the fourth element is 0, and the fifth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 4, i is 3**

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

* The first line `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts the value of `list[i - 1]` from itself, effectively setting it to 0. Since `i` is 3, this affects the third element of the list, which was originally greater than 1. Now, the third element becomes 0.
* The second line `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` subtracts twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`. Since `list[i - 1]` is now 0 (from the previous line), this line has no effect on `list[i]`, which remains greater than 1.
* The third line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts the value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`. Since `list[i - 1]` is now 0 (from the first line), this line has no effect on `list[i + 1]`, which remains greater than 0 and less than its original value.

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
