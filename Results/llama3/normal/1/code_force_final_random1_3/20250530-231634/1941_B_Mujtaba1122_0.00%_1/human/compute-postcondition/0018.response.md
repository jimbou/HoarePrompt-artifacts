Output State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 0, the fourth element is 0, and the fifth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 4, i is 3**

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

* The first line `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` sets the third element of the list to 0, since `i` is 3 and `list[i - 1]` is the third element.
* The second line `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` subtracts twice the value of the third element (which is now 0) from the fourth element, effectively leaving the fourth element unchanged. However, since the fourth element was originally greater than 1 and less than its original value, it is now 0.
* The third line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts the value of the third element (which is now 0) from the fifth element, leaving the fifth element unchanged. However, since the fifth element was originally greater than 0 and less than its original value, it remains greater than 0 and less than its original value.

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
