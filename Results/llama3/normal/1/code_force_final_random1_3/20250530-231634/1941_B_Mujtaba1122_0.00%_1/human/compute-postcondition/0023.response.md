Output State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, and the fifth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 4, i is 3**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list where the first three elements are 0, and the last two elements are positive integers less than their original values. The length of the list remains the same, and the index i remains at 3.
