Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

Function 1, `func_1`, checks if the first n elements of a list are all zeros. It returns False as soon as it encounters a non-zero element, otherwise returns True if all elements up to the nth index are zero.

Function 2, `func_2`, modifies the input list by iteratively applying the operation to the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1, based on certain conditions. It then checks the modified list using `func_1` and prints 'YES' if the function returns True, and 'NO' otherwise.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of `func_2`. The while loop condition `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` is incorrect. This condition will not correctly determine when to apply the operation. 

Moreover, the operation itself is also incorrect. The lines `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` do not accurately represent the operation described in the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
