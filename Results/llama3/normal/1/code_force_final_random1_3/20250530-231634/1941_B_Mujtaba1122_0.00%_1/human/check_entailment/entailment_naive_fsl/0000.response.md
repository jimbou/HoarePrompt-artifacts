Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the operations are performed in `func_2`. The current implementation subtracts multiples of `list[i - 1]` from the elements, which is not the correct interpretation of the operation described in the problem. The operation should subtract 1 from `a_{i - 1}`, 2 from `a_i`, and 1 from `a_{i + 1}`, not multiples of `list[i - 1]`.

For example, consider the input `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The correct sequence of operations to make all elements zero is:

* Apply the operation at `i=4` to get `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`.
* Apply the operation at `i=3` to get `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`.
* Apply the operation at `i=2` to get `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.
* Apply the operation at `i=4` to get `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

However, the program's implementation of `func_2` would not perform these operations correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
