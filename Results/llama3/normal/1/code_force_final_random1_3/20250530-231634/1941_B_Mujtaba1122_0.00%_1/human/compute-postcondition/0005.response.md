To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `list[i]` is unchanged, `list[i - 1]` is 0, and `list[i + 1]` is unchanged. Since `list[i - 1]` is 0, it does not satisfy the condition `list[i - 1] > 0`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `list[i - 1]` to be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is greater than 0, the element at index i-1 is greater than 0, the element at index i is unchanged, the element at index i+1 is unchanged, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1**
