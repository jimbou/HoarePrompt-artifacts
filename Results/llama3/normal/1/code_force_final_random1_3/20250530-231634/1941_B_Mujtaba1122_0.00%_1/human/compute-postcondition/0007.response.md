Output State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 0, the element at index i-1 is 0, the element at index i is 0, the element at index i+1 is greater than 0, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 0, the element at index i-1 is 0, the element at index i is 0, the element at index i+1 is greater than 0, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 3, and i is 1.
