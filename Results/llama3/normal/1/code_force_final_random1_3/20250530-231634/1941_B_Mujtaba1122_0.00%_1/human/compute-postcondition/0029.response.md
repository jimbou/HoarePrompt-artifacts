Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'NO'.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The initial state describes a list of non-negative integers with specific properties, but the actual values of the list elements are not relevant to the print statement.
* The variables n, i, and the function func_1(list, n) are also defined, but they do not affect the print statement.
* The print statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'NO', without any variables or calculations involved.

Output: **NO**
