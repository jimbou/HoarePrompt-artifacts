Output State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, and the element at index `i+1` is greater than 0 and less than its original value, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `list` and `n >= 4`, `i` is 2**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and less than its original value, and the element at index `i+1` is greater than 0 and less than its original value. The length of the list `n` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, and the index `i` remains 2.
