Output State: **list is a list of non-negative integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is greater than 0, the element at index i-1 is 0, the element at index i is 0, the element at index i+1 is greater than 0, n is a positive integer equal to the length of list and n >= 3, i is 1**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The list remains a list of non-negative integers, with the first element still being 0. The second element, which was greater than 0, is now 0. The third element, which was also greater than 0, is now 0. The element at index i-1, which was greater than 0, is now 0. The element at index i, which was unchanged, is now 0. The element at index i+1, which was unchanged, remains greater than 0. The value of n remains a positive integer equal to the length of the list, and n is still greater than or equal to 3. The value of i remains 1.
