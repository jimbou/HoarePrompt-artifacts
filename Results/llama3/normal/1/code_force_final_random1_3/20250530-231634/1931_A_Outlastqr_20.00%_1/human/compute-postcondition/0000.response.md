The code assigns the string of all lowercase English letters to the variable `alphabet`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the encoded words). The number of test cases is a positive integer and the encoded words are integers between 3 and 78 (inclusive). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the encoded words). The number of test cases is a positive integer and the encoded words are integers between 3 and 78 (inclusive).**
