Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program uses a specific mapping to decode each integer into a three-letter string.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the encoded word (an integer) and decodes it into a three-letter string using the following logic:

- If the encoded word is greater than 52, it adds the corresponding letter from the alphabet (starting from 'a') to the word, followed by 'zz'.
- If the encoded word is greater than 26, it adds 'a' to the word, followed by the corresponding letter from the alphabet (starting from 'a'), and then 'z'.
- If the encoded word is less than or equal to 26, it adds 'aa' to the word, followed by the corresponding letter from the alphabet (starting from 'a').

The program then prints the decoded word for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer.

Correctness: **True**
