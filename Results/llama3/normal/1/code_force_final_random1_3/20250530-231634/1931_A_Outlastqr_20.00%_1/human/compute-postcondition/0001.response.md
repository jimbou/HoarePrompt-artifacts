The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `input()`. If input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters and stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the encoded words) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) that must be greater than 0 and then a list of integers (the encoded words), i is 0**
