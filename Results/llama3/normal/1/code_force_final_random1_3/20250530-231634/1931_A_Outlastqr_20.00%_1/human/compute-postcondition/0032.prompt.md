Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the encoded words). The number of test cases is a positive integer and the encoded words are integers between 3 and 78 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 26:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, word is a string, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, i is 0. If n is larger than 52, word is a string that contains the (n-52)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz'. If n is between 28 and 52, word is 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z'. If n is less than or equal to 26, word is a string that ends with 'aa' followed by a lowercase English letter. The word is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, word is a string, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a list of integers with at least 1 integer, i is 1. If n > 52, word is the character at index n - 53 of the alphabet string followed by 'zz'. If n is between 28 and 52, word is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'. If n is between 2 and 27, word is 'aa' followed by the (n - 2)th letter of the alphabet. If n is less than or equal to 1, word remains an empty string. The value of the word is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the original stdin, word is a string, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and i is 2. If n > 52, word is a string consisting of a single character from the alphabet string (determined by n - 53) followed by the string 'zz'. If n is between 27 and 52, word starts with 'a', followed by a lowercase letter, and ends with 'z'. If n is between 3 and 26, word is 'aa' plus the character at index n - 3 of the alphabet, and the word is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
