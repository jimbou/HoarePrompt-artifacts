The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin has at least 1 integer, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least 2 integers and the i is 2.
State: **n is an integer, word is a string, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a list of integers with at least 2 integers, i is 2**
