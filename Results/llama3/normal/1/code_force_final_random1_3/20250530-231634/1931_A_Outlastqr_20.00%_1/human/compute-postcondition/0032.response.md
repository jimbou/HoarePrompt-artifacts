Output State: **n is an integer equal to the number of test cases, word is a string, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin is empty, and i is equal to the number of test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will hold the value of the number of test cases, `word` will be a string that has been constructed based on the last encoded word, `alphabet` will still be a string of all lowercase English letters, `stdin` will be empty because all inputs have been consumed, and `i` will be equal to the number of test cases because the loop has iterated that many times.
