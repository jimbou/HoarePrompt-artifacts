The code `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` adds the string `'aa'` and the `n-3`th character of the `alphabet` string to the `word` string. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 26, `n-3` is between -2 and 23. The `alphabet` string contains all lowercase English letters, so the `n-3`th character is a lowercase letter.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 26, `word` is a string that ends with 'aa' followed by a lowercase English letter, `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 0.**
