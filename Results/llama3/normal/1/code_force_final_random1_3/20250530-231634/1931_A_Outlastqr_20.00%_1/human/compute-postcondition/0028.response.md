Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer from the original stdin, word is a string, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and i is 2. If n > 26, word starts with 'a', followed by a lowercase letter (if n is greater than 28), and ends with 'z'. Otherwise, word is 'aa' plus the character at index n - 3 of the alphabet.***
