Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, word is an empty string, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, i is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which must be greater than 0. This consumes the first input from stdin, leaving only the list of integers. The second line initializes an empty string `word`. The values of `alphabet` and `i` remain unchanged.
