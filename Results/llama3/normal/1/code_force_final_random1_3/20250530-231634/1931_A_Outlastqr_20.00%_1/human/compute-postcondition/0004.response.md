Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `word` is a string that contains the (n-52)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz', `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 0, and the current value of `n` is greater than 52**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to include the (n-52)th letter of the alphabet (since `n` is greater than 52) followed by the string 'zz'. The other variables remain unchanged.
