Output State: **n is an integer, word is an empty string, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a list of integers with at least 1 integer, i is 1**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer greater than 0, it is now reassigned to a new integer value from stdin. Stdin now contains a list of integers with at least 1 integer. The second line assigns an empty string to `word`, overwriting its previous value. The values of `alphabet` and `i` remain unchanged.
