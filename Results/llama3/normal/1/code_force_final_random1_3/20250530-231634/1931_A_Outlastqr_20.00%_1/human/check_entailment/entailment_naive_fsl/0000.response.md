Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The logic is as follows:

- If the input number `n` is greater than 52, it means that the first letter must be at least 'b' (since 'a' would only contribute 1 to the sum, and 52 is the maximum sum that can be achieved with 'a' as the first letter). In this case, the program subtracts 53 from `n` to get the index of the first letter in the alphabet, and appends 'zz' to get the lexicographically smallest word.

- If `n` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive), it means that the first letter must be 'a', and the second letter must be at least 'b'. In this case, the program subtracts 28 from `n` to get the index of the second letter in the alphabet, and appends 'az' to get the lexicographically smallest word.

- If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it means that all three letters must be 'a'. In this case, the program simply appends 'aa' and the corresponding letter to get the lexicographically smallest word.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
