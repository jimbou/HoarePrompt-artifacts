Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer from the original stdin, word is a string, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and i is 2. If n > 52, word is a string consisting of a single character from the alphabet string (determined by n - 53) followed by the string 'zz'. If n is between 27 and 52, word starts with 'a', followed by a lowercase letter, and ends with 'z'. If n is between 3 and 26, word is 'aa' plus the character at index n - 3 of the alphabet.***
