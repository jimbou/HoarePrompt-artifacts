Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If the difference between the 3rd and 2nd elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
