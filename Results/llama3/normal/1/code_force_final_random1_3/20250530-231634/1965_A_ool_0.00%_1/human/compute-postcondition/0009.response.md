The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to its opposite. Since `A` is initially `False`, its new value will be `True`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `set_` and the first element of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.**
