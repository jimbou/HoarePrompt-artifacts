To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `set_`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `set_` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, `not_c` is True, `i` is 1**
