Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, `not_c` is True, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is 1. The difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `set_` is greater than 1.**
