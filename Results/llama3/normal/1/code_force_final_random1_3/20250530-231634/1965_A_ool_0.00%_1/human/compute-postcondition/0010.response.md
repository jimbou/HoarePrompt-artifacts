To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `set_`. Since `i` is currently 1, and the length of `set_` is at least 2 (since it has at least 2 elements), the loop can execute again.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `set_` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, the loop will execute again if the length of `set_` is at least 3.

The other variables, `arr`, `A`, and `not_c`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
