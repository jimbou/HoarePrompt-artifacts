Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, `A` is True if the length of `set_` is even and False if the length of `set_` is odd, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `i` is `len(set_) - 1`, and `not_c` is True, indicating that there is no pair of adjacent elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1.**
