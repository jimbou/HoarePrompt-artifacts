Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The issue lies in the function `func_1(arr)`, where it only checks if the smallest pile size is 1 and then checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

A counterexample is when the input is `[2, 2, 3, 3]`. The program will return `'Alice'`, but the correct answer is `'Bob'`. This is because Alice can only remove 1 stone from each pile on her first turn, leaving `[1, 1, 2, 2]`. Then, Bob can remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving `[0, 0, 1, 1]`. Now, Alice cannot make a move, so she loses.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use the XOR operation. The XOR of all pile sizes determines the winner of the game. If the XOR is 0, then Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the XOR operation has the property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`, which means that if the XOR of all pile sizes is 0, then the piles can be reduced to 0 by removing the same number of stones from each pile in each turn.
