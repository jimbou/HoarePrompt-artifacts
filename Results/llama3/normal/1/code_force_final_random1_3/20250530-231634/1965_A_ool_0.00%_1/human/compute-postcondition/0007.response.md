Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, not_c is False, i is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`, changing its initial value from `True` to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or the current execution block. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `not_c`, which is now `False`. All other variables (`arr`, `A`, `set_`, and `i`) retain their initial values, as they are not modified by the code.
