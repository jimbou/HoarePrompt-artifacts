To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `set_`. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.

The length of `set_` must also be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute again. Since `set_` must have at least 3 elements, its length must be at least 4 (since indexing starts at 0). Therefore, the length of `set_` must be greater than or equal to 4.

The other variables, `arr`, `A`, and `not_c`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3**
