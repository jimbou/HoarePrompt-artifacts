Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, A is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 3 elements, i is 2, not_c is False**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

The initial state variables `arr`, `A`, `set_`, and `i` are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

The final state includes the newly introduced variable `not_c` with the value `False`, and the unchanged values of `arr`, `A`, `set_`, and `i`.
