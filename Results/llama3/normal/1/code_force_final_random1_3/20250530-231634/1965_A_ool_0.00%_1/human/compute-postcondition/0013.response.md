Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `A` has been changed to False, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still has its first element as 1, and `set_` remains a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 3 elements. The value of `i` is still 2. The condition regarding the difference between elements in `set_` and the value of `not_c` also remains the same.
