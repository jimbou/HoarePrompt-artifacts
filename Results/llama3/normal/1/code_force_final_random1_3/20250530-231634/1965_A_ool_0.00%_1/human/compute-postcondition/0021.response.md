Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers with its first element being 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `i` is `len(set_) - 1`. If there is no pair of adjacent elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1, then `not_c` is True and `A` is False if the length of `set_` is even and True if the length of `set_` is odd. Otherwise, `not_c` is False and `A` is True if the length of `set_` is even and False if the length of `set_` is odd.***
