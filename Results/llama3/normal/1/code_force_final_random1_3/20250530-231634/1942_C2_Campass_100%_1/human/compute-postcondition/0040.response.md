Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `sx` is 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing the value of `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, where the even values come first in ascending order, followed by the odd values in ascending order, `i` is `x`, `c` is equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, and stdin contains `t - (x + 1)` test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `sx`, `y`, `l`, `i`, `c`, and `cons` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `val` list, which is now sorted based on the given key function. The key function sorts the list in ascending order, but with a twist: even values come first, followed by odd values. This is achieved by the expression `(1 - x & 1, x)`, which returns a tuple for each value in the list. The first element of the tuple is 1 if the value is even (since `x & 1` would be 0 for even values) and 0 if the value is odd. The second element of the tuple is the value itself. This way, even values are sorted before odd values, and within each group, the values are sorted in ascending order.
