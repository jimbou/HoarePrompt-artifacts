Postcondition: ***t is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), if y < c, sx is equal to its original value plus 2 times y. y is an integer between 0 and n - x - c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least two elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, sorted by the key function lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), i is the second element of val, c is equal to i // 2, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.***
