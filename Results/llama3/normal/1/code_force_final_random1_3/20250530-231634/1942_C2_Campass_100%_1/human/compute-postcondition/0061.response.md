According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of `t` needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and `t` currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is greater than 0 and the original value of `t` is greater than or equal to 4**
