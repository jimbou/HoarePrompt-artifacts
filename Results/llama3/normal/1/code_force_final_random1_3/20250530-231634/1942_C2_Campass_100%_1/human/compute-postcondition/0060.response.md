Output: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `sx` is increased by the sum of all elements in `val`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x` and is equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `val // 2`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the last element of `val`, `c` is equal to the last element of `val // 2`, and stdin contains `t - (x + 1)` test cases, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to `x + sx - 2`)**
