Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4 and t is greater than 0 and the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is an empty list**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now 1 less than its original value minus 3. Since `t` was originally greater than or equal to 4, it is still greater than 0. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned integer values from the function `R()`. The variable `sx` has been initialized to 0. The list `l` has been created by sorting the values returned by the function `R()`, and then appending the sum of the first element and `n` to the end of the list. Finally, the list `val` has been initialized as an empty list.
