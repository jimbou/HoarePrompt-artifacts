The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be at least 2.
State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer at least 2, sx is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing the value of l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, i is 3, c is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is equal to x + sx - 2, and stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.**
