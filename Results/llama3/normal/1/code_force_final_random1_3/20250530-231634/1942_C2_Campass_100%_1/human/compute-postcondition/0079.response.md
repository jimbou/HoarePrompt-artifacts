Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, t is greater than 0, the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is y - c, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1, ..., l[x] - l[x-1] - 1, sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x) and must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list, c is i // 2, sx is sx + y * 2**

The code modifies the values of `sx` and `y`. The first line increments `sx` by twice the value of `y`, and the second line decrements `y` by the value of `c`. No other variables are affected.
