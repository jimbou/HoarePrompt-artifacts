Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), sx is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is an empty list, i is equal to the last element of val, c is equal to i // 2, cons is equal to x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to x + sx - 2).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer at least 1, sx is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing the value of l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, i is 1, c is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is equal to x + sx - 2, and stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer at least 1, sx is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing the value of l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, i is 2, c is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is equal to x + sx - 2, and stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer at least 2, sx is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing the value of l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, i is 3, c is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is equal to x + sx - 2, and stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
