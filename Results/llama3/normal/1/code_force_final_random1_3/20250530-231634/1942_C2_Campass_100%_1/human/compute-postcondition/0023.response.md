Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `sx` is equal to its original value plus 2 times `y` plus `i`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x - c - c`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing at least three elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of `l` minus 1, sorted by the key function lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is the third element of `val`, `c` is equal to `i // 2`, stdin contains `t - (x + 1)` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `c` has been updated to be equal to `i // 2`, where `i` is the third element of the sorted list `val`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
