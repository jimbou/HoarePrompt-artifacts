Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `sx` is 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a non-empty sorted list containing the value of `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, where the even values come first in ascending order, followed by the odd values in ascending order, `i` is the first element of `val`, `c` is equal to `i // 2`, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, and stdin contains `t - (x + 1)` test cases. The current value of `y` is less than `c`***
