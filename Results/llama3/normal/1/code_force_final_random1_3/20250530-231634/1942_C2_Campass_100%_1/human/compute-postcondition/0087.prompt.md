Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, t is greater than 0, the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1, ..., l[x] - l[x-1] - 1, sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), i is x, c is l[x] - l[x-1] - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, t is greater than 0, the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1, ..., l[x] - l[x-1] - 1, sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x) and must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, c is i // 2, sx is either 2y + i if y is less than c, or i if y is not less than c, y is y - c.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, t is greater than 0, the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1, ..., l[x] - l[x-1] - 1, sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x) and must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list, c is i // 2, y is y - c - c, if y < c, sx is sx + y * 2 + i

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, t is greater than 0, the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1, ..., l[x] - l[x-1] - 1, sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x) and must have at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list, c is i // 2, y is y - c - c, if y < c, sx is sx + y * 2 + i, otherwise sx is sx + y * 2, sx is sx + i, y is y - c.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
