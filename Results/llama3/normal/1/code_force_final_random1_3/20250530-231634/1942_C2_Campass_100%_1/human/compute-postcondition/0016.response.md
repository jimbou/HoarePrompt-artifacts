Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), sx is either 0 or equal to its original value plus 2 times y plus i, y is an integer between 0 and n - x minus c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least one element which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, sorted by the key function lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), i is the first element of val, c is equal to half of the first element of val, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.**

In this final state, the value of sx has been updated by adding i to it, and the value of y has been updated by subtracting c from it. All other variables remain unchanged.
