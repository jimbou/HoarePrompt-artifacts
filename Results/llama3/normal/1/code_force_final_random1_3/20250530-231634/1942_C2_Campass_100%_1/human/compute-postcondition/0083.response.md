Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, `t` is greater than 0, the original value of `t` is greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and `n`, `val` is a sorted list containing `x` elements which are `l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1, ..., l[x] - l[x-1] - 1`, sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is `y - c - c`, if `y < c`, `sx` is `sx + y * 2 + i**, and `c` is updated to be half of `i`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their original values and properties, except for `c`, which is now equal to half of `i`. The value of `i` is still the third element in the list `val`, and `c` is now updated to be `i // 2`. The rest of the variables and their properties remain unchanged.
