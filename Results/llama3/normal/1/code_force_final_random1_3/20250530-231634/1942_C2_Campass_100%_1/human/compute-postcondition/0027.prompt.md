Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing x - 1 elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, sorted by the key function lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), sx is either 0 or equal to its original value plus 2 times y plus i, y is an integer between 0 and n - x minus c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least one element which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, sorted by the key function lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), i is the first element of val, c is equal to half of the first element of val, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), sx is equal to its original value plus 2 times y plus i, y is an integer between 0 and n - x - c - c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least two elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, sorted by the key function lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), i is the second element of val, c is equal to i // 2, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), sx is equal to its original value plus 3 times i plus y if y is greater than or equal to c, otherwise sx is equal to its original value plus 5 times y plus i, y is an integer between 0 and n - x - c - c - c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least three elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, sorted by the key function lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), i is the third element of val, c is equal to i // 2, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
