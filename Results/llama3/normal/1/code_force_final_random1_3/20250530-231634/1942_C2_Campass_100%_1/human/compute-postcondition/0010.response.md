Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing x - 1 elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, sorted by the key function lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `val` is now sorted according to the key function lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), which means that the elements in `val` are sorted first by whether they are odd or even (with even numbers coming first), and then by their actual value. All other variables remain unchanged.
