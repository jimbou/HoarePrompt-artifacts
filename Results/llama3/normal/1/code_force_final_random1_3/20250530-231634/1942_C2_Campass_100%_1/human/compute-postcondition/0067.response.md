To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `x` is at least 2, it must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, t is greater than 0, the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 3, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is a list containing two elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1 and l[2] - l[1] - 1, i is 3, c is l[2] - l[1] - 1**
