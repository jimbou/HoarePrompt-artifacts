To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `x` is an integer between 2 and `min(n, 2 * 10^5)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `x` is already greater than or equal to 2, it remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer between 0 and n - x, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, `val` is a list containing two elements which are the difference between the second and first elements of l minus 1 and the difference between the third and second elements of l minus 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 3**
