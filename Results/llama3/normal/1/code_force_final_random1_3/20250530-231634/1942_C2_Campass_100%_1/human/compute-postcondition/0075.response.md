Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, `t` is greater than 0, the original value of `t` is greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and `n`, `val` is a sorted list containing `x` elements which are `l[1]` - `l[0]` - 1, `l[2]` - `l[1]` - 1, ..., `l[x]` - `l[x-1]` - 1, sorted by the key (1 - `x` & 1, `x`) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list, `c` is `i // 2`. If `y` is less than `c`, then `sx` is set to 2y. Otherwise, `sx` remains 0.***
