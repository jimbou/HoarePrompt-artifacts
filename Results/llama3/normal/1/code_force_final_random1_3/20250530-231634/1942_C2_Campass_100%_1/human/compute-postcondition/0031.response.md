The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time t needed to have been equal or greater than 2 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `sx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `val`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x` minus the sum of all `c` values, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the last element of `val`, `c` is equal to `i // 2`, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, stdin contains `t - (x + 1)` test cases, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to `x + sx - 2`).**
