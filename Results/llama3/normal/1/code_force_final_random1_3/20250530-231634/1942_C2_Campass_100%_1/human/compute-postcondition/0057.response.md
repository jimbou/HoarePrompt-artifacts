Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), sx is increased by the sum of all elements in val, y is an integer between 0 and n - x and is equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in val // 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is an empty list, i is equal to the last element of val, c is equal to the last element of val // 2, cons is equal to x + sx - 2 + the sum of all elements in val, and stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The variable `sx` has been increased by the sum of all elements in `val`, and `y` has been decreased by the sum of all elements in `val` divided by 2. The list `val` is now empty, and the variable `i` is equal to the last element of `val`. The variable `c` is equal to the last element of `val` divided by 2. The variable `cons` has been updated to include the sum of all elements in `val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
