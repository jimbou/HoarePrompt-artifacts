To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Since `x` is already defined as an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), we can conclude that `x` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 1, since the loop starts from 1.

State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is 1**
