Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `sx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `val`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x` minus the sum of all `c` values, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the last element of `val`, `c` is equal to `i // 2`, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, stdin contains `t - (x + 1)` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cons` has been calculated as `x + sx - 2`, where `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `sx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `val`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
