Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), sx is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in val, y is an integer between 0 and n - x minus the sum of all c values, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is an empty list, i is equal to the last element of val, c is equal to i // 2, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `sx` has been updated to include the sum of all elements in the list `val`, and the variable `y` has been updated to be the remaining value after subtracting the sum of all `c` values from its original value. The list `val` is now empty, and the variable `i` is equal to the last element of `val`. The variable `c` is equal to half of the last element of `val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
