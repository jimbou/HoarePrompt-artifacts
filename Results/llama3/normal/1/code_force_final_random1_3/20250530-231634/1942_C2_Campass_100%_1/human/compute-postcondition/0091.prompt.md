Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `sx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `val`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x` minus the sum of all `c` values, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the last element of `val`, `c` is equal to `i // 2`, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, stdin contains `t - (x + 1)` test cases, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to `x + sx - 2`).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `sx` is increased by the sum of all elements in `val`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n - x` and is equal to its original value minus the sum of all elements in `val // 2`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the last element of `val`, `c` is equal to the last element of `val // 2`, and stdin contains `t - (x + 1)` test cases, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to `x + sx - 2`)
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, `t` is greater than 0, the original value of `t` is greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and `n`, `val` is a sorted list containing `x` elements which are `l[1]` - `l[0]` - 1, `l[2]` - `l[1]` - 1, ..., `l[x]` - `l[x-1]` - 1, sorted by the key (1 - `x` & 1, `x`), `i` is the last element in the list, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus the sum of `y * 2` for each iteration where `y` is less than `c`, `y` is `y` minus the sum of `c` for all iterations, `cons` is `x + sx - 2`, and the value of `cons` is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
