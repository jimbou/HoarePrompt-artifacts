The code prints the value of `cons` which is calculated as `x + sx - 2`. 

Since `sx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `val`, and `val` is an empty list, `sx` is equal to its original value. 

The value of `cons` is therefore `x` plus its original value minus 2.

Output: **x + its original value - 2 (where x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5))**
