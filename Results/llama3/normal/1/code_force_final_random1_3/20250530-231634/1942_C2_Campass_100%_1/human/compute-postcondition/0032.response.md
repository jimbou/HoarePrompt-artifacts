Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), sx is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n - x, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is an empty list, i is equal to the last element of val, c is equal to i // 2, cons is equal to x + sx - 2, stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to x + sx - 2).**

Explanation:
The first line decrements `t` by 1, making it 2 less than its original value. The second line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y`, respectively. The third line resets `sx` to 0. The fourth line reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them, and appends `n +` the first element to the end, assigning the result to `l`. The fifth line initializes an empty list `val`. 

Note that the values of `i` and `c` are not explicitly updated in the code snippet, but since `val` is empty, `i` is still equal to the last element of `val` (which is undefined), and `c` is still equal to `i // 2` (which is also undefined). However, since `val` is empty, we can infer that `i` and `c` are not affected by the code. The value of `cons` is not explicitly updated, but since `sx` is reset to 0, `cons` is now equal to `x - 2`.
