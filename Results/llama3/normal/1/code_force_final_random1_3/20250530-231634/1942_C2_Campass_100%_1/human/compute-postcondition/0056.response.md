Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), sx is increased by i, y is an integer between 0 and n - x and is equal to its original value minus i // 2 - c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a non-empty sorted list containing the value of l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1 for i from 1 to x, where the even values come first in ascending order, followed by the odd values in ascending order, and val has at least 3 elements, i is the third element of val, c is equal to the third element of val // 2, cons is equal to x + sx - 2 + i, and stdin contains t - (x + 1) test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `sx` has been increased by `i`, and the value of `y` has been decreased by `c`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `cons` has also been updated to reflect the change in `sx`.
