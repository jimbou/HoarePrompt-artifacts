Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1.**

The code reads the first integer from the input, which is the number of test cases `t`. This value is assigned to the variable `t`. The state of `t` is updated to be one less than its original value, as one test case has been read. The state of stdin is updated to contain `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
