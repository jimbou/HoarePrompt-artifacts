Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4 and t is greater than 0 and the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, t is greater than 0, the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 1, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is a list containing one element which is l[1] - l[0] - 1, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, t is greater than 0, the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 2, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is a list containing two elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1 and l[2] - l[1] - 1, i is 2, c is l[2] - l[1] - 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, t is greater than 0, the original value of t is greater than or equal to 4, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 3, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of integers with the last element being the sum of the first element and n, val is a list containing three elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1, and l[3] - l[2] - 1, i is 3, c is l[3] - l[2] - 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
