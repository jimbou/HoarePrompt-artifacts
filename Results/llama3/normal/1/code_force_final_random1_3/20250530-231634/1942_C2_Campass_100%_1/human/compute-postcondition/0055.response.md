Postcondition: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than 1 and between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `sx` is increased by `i` + 2 times `y` if `y` is greater than or equal to `c`, otherwise `sx` is increased by 2 times `y` + `i` + 2 times `y`, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n` - `x` and is equal to its original value minus `i` // 2, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a non-empty sorted list containing the value of `l[i]` - `l[i - 1]` - 1 for `i` from 1 to `x`, where the even values come first in ascending order, followed by the odd values in ascending order, and `val` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `val`, `c` is equal to the third element of `val` // 2, `cons` is equal to `x` + `sx` - 2, and stdin contains `t` - (`x` + 1) test cases.**
