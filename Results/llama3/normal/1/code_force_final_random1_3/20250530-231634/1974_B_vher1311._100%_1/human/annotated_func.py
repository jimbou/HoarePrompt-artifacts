#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string of lowercase Latin letters where each character is the reversed mapping of the corresponding character in the encoded string, according to the mapping dictionary.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of lowercase Latin letters, removes duplicate characters, sorts them in ascending order, creates a mapping dictionary that reverses the order of these unique characters, and applies this mapping to the original string, returning a new string where each character is replaced by its reversed mapping counterpart.
