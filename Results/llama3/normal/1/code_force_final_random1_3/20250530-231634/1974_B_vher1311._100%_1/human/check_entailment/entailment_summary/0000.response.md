Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program creates a new string `r` that consists of all distinct letters of `b`, written in alphabetical order. This is done using the `set` function to remove duplicates and the `sorted` function to sort the characters.

4. The program then creates a mapping dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This is done using a dictionary comprehension that iterates over the indices `i` of `r` and maps each character `r[i]` to the character at the corresponding symmetric index `-(i + 1)`.

5. Finally, the program applies this mapping to the original encoded string `b` using a generator expression that replaces each character `char` in `b` with its corresponding symmetric character `mapping[char]`. The resulting decoded string is then returned.

6. The program repeats this process for each test case and prints the decoded strings.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
