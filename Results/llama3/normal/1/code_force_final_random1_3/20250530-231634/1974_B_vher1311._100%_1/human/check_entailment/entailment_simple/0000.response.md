Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the auxiliary string `r` consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` (the original string), written in alphabetical order.

2. The program then creates a mapping dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`). This is correct because the problem statement specifies that each character in the string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` during the encoding process.

3. Finally, the program uses the `mapping` dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character in the original string `s`. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the decoding process involves replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character from the string `r`.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
