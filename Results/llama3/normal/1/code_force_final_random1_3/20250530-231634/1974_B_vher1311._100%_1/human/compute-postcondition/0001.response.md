Output State: **The program returns a string of lowercase Latin letters where each character is the reversed mapping of the corresponding character in the encoded string, according to the mapping dictionary.**

In this output state, each character in the returned string corresponds to a character in the `encoded` string, but with its mapping reversed according to the `mapping` dictionary. The `mapping` dictionary contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and its corresponding value is its reversed mapping. The `encoded` string is a string of lowercase Latin letters. The `r` string, which is a string of unique lowercase Latin letters in ascending order, is not directly used in the return statement, but it may have been used to create the `mapping` dictionary.
