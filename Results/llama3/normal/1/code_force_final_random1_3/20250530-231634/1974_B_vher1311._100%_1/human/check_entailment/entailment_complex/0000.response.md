Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` by removing duplicate characters from the input string `b` and sorting them in alphabetical order.

2. The program then creates a mapping dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`). This is done correctly using the dictionary comprehension `{r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}`.

3. Finally, the program applies this mapping to the input string `b` by replacing each character with its symmetric character according to the mapping dictionary. This is done correctly using the expression `''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)`.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
