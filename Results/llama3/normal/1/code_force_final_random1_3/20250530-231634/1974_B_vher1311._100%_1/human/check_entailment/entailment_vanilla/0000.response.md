Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases `t` and the length of the encoded string `n`. It then reads the encoded string `b` for each test case.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input and returns the decoded string. The function works as follows:

1. It creates a new string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order.
2. It creates a mapping dictionary `mapping` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. The symmetric character of a character at index `i` in `r` is the character at index `-i-1` in `r`.
3. It uses the `mapping` dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character, effectively decoding the string.

The program then appends the decoded string to the `results` list for each test case and finally prints the decoded strings for all test cases.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles the input data correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
