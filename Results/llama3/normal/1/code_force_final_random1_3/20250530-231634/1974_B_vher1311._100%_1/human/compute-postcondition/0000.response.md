Output State: **encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, r is a string of unique lowercase Latin letters in ascending order, mapping is a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of a lowercase Latin letter and its corresponding reversed mapping.**

Here's a breakdown of the output state:

* `encoded` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
* `r` is a string of unique lowercase Latin letters in ascending order, obtained by sorting and removing duplicates from `encoded`.
* `mapping` is a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of a lowercase Latin letter and its corresponding reversed mapping. The dictionary is created by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping each character to its corresponding character at the reversed index. For example, if `r` is "abc", the mapping would be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
