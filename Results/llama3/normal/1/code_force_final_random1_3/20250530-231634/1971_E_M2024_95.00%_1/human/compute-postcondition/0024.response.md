Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 4, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `ad` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `v` is a list containing four integers, the first integer is 0, the second integer is the difference between the second and first elements in `a` divided by 0, the third integer is the difference between the third and second elements in `a` divided by 0, and the fourth integer is the difference between the fourth and third elements in `a` divided by 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 1, the value of `_` is still 0, the values of `n`, `k`, and `q` are still integers, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, the list `ad` remains the same, the list `bd` remains the same, the list `v` now has an additional element which is the difference between the fourth and third elements in `a` divided by 0, the stdin remains empty, and the value of `i` is still 3.
