Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), b is a list of integers with a length of at least len(b), ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(b) - 1 integers are b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b)), t is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains -2 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a)), l is 0, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, m is equal to b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], and ql is equal to the input value minus a[s - 1] minus a[s - 1], and this is printed: the integer value of m which is equal to b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s]**
