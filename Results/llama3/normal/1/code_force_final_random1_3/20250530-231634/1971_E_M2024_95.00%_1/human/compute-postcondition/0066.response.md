Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains -q - 2 inputs, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, l is q, m is the original value of m plus the value of b at index s - 1 plus the product of bd at index s, ql, and the reciprocal of ad at index s, ql is the original value of ql minus the value of a at index s - 1, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is len(a) - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ad` now contains the differences between consecutive elements in list `a`, and the loop counter `i` has reached the second last index of list `a`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
