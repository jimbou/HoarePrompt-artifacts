Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, ad is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, m is not 0, i is 1, l is 2, ql is an integer less than its original value, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of ql has been reduced by the value of a[s - 1]. The value of m has been increased by the value of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s], ql, and the reciprocal of ad[s]. No other variables have been modified.
