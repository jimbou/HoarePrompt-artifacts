Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers, the first integer is 0, and the last integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers, the first integer is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -3 inputs, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers, the first integer is 0, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 1, and nothing is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ad` has been updated by appending the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, i.e., `a[1] - a[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
