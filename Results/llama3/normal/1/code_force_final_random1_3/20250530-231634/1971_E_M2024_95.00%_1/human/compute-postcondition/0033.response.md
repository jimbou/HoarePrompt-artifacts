Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `ad` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `v` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 0, `i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is an integer, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order. If the current value of `a` at index `s` is equal to `ql`, then the value of `b` at index `s` is printed and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
