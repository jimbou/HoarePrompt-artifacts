Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `ad` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0 and the differences between the first two and the second and third elements in `b`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `bd` has been updated to include the difference between the second and third elements in `b`, in addition to the difference between the first two elements.
