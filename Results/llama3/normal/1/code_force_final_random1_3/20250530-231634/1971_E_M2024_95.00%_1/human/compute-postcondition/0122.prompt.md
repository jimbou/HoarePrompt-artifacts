Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, t is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains -3 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, l is q, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is len(a) - 1, and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers, the first integer is 0, and the last integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers, the first integer is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -3 inputs, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers, the first integer is 0, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 1, and nothing is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers, the first integer is 0, the last integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, and the last but one integer is `a[2] - a[1]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers, the first integer is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -3 inputs, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers, the first integer is 0, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 2, and nothing is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 4, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers, the first integer is 0, the last integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, the last but one integer is `a[2] - a[1]`, and the last integer is `a[3] - a[2]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers, the first integer is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -3 inputs, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers, the first integer is 0, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 3, and nothing is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
