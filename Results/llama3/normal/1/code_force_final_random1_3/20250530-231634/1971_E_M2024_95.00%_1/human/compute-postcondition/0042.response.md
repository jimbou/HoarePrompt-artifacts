Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, ad is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, m is 0, i is 1, l is 2, ql is an integer, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, stdin contains 0 inputs. If a[s] is equal to ql, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
