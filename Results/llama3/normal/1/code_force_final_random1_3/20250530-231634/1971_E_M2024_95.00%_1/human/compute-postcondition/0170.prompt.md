Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first a line with three integers n, k, and q, then a line with k integers a_i, then a line with k integers b_i, and finally q lines each with a single integer d. n and k are non-negative integers, 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= q <= 10^5, 1 <= a_i <= n, a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, a_k = n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, and 0 <= d <= n. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, ad is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, l is q, m is the original value of m plus the value of b at index s - 1 plus the product of bd at index s, ql, and the reciprocal of ad at index s, ql is the original value of ql minus the value of a at index s - 1, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, stdin contains -q inputs, and the integer value of m is printed, nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in b, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is q, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is len(a) - 1, and nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), b is a list of integers with a length of at least len(b), ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(b) - 1 integers are b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b)), t is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains 0 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a)), l is q, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, and m is b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], and nothing is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
