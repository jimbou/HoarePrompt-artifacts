Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing three integers, the first integer is 0, the second integer is `b[1] - b[0]`, and the third integer is `b[2] - b[1]`, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains `-q - 2` inputs, `v` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 0, `l` is `q`, `m` is the original value of `m` plus the value of `b` at index `s - 1` plus the product of `bd` at index `s`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad` at index `s`, `ql` is the original value of `ql` minus the value of `a` at index `s - 1`, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated by appending the difference between the third and second elements of `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
