Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `ad` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `v` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the last index of `b`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `v` will contain integers, where the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 0. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to the length of `a`, and in each iteration, it will append the difference between the current element and the previous element in `a` divided by 0 to the list `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, ad is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, i is 1, l is 1, m is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], ql is ql - a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order. If the current value of a at index s is equal to ql, then the value of b at index s is printed and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken. and this is printed: the integer value of m which is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, ad is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, m is not 0, i is 1, l is 2, ql is an integer less than its original value, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, stdin contains 0 inputs, and the integer value of m is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 2, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, ad is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, m is the original value of m plus the value of b at index s - 1 plus the product of bd at index s, ql, and the reciprocal of ad at index s, ql is the original value of ql minus the value of a at index s - 1, i is 1, l is 3, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, stdin contains -1 inputs, and the integer value of m is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
