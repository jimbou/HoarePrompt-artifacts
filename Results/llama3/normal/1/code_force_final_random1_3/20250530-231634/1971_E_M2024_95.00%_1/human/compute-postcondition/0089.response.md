Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in b, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains -q - 1 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 0, m is 0, ql is an integer, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, and if the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, then the value of b[s] is printed and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped and we move to the next iteration.**
