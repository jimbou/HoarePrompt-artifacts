Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, the second integer is b[1] - b[0], and the third integer is b[2] - b[1], `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -3 inputs, `v` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], `s` is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, and `i` is 2**

In this output state, the list `bd` has been updated by appending the difference between the second and first elements of list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
