According to the code, the only variable in the loop head is `l`. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `q`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be increased by 1, so `l` is 2 and `q` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `ad` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `v` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 0, `i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is `m` + `b[s - 1]` + `bd[s]` * `ql` / `ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order.**
