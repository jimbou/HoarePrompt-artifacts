Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least len(b), `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(b) - 1 integers are b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b)), `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains -1 inputs, `v` is a list containing len(a) integers where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a)), `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], `s` is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, and `i` is len(a) - 1.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), b is a list of integers with a length of at least len(b), ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(b) - 1 integers are b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b)), t is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains -2 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a)), l is 0, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, m is equal to b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], and ql is equal to the input value minus a[s - 1] minus a[s - 1], and this is printed: the integer value of m which is equal to b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), b is a list of integers with a length of at least len(b), ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(b) - 1 integers are b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b)), t is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains -1 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a)), l is 1, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1] minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, m is b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s] plus b[s - 1], and the integer value of m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), b is a list of integers with a length of at least len(b), ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(b) - 1 integers are b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b)), t is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains -2 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a)), l is 2, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1] minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, m is b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], and the integer value of m is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
