Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing a single integer 0, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains -q - 2 inputs, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, l is q, m is the original value of m plus the value of b at index s - 1 plus the product of bd at index s, ql, and the reciprocal of ad at index s, ql is the original value of ql minus the value of a at index s - 1, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is 0 and the second integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains -q - 2 inputs, `v` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 0, `l` is `q`, `m` is the original value of `m` plus the value of `b` at index `s` - 1 plus the product of `bd` at index `s`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad` at index `s`, `ql` is the original value of `ql` minus the value of `a` at index `s` - 1, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing three integers, the first integer is 0, the second integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, and the third integer is `a[2] - a[1]`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains -q - 2 inputs, `v` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 0, `l` is `q`, `m` is the original value of `m` plus the value of `b` at index `s` - 1 plus the product of `bd` at index `s`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad` at index `s`, `ql` is the original value of `ql` minus the value of `a` at index `s` - 1, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 4, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing five integers, the first integer is 0, the second integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, the third integer is `a[2] - a[1]`, the fourth integer is `a[3] - a[2]`, and the fifth integer is `a[3] - a[2]`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains -q - 2 inputs, `v` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 0, `l` is `q`, `m` is the original value of `m` plus the value of `b` at index `s` - 1 plus the product of `bd` at index `s`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad` at index `s`, `ql` is the original value of `ql` minus the value of `a` at index `s` - 1, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
