Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 4, `ad` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, the differences between the first two and the second and third elements in `b`, and the difference between the third and fourth elements in `b`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated by appending the difference between the third and fourth elements in `b`, which is `b[3] - b[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
