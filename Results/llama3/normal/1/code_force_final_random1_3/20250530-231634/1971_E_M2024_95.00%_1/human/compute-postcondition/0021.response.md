To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The objects involved are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` has a length of at least 2.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `a` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `ad` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `v` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is 0 and the second integer is the difference between the second and first elements in `a` divided by 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2**
