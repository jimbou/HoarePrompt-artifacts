Output State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains -q - 2 inputs, `v` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, `l` is `q`, `m` is the original value of `m` plus the value of `b` at index `s` - 1 plus the product of `bd` at index `s`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad` at index `s`, `ql` is the original value of `ql` minus the value of `a` at index `s` - 1, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is len(a) - 1.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the following changes:

* The list `v` now contains `len(a)` integers, where the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`.
* The variable `i` is now equal to `len(a) - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.
