Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 4, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing five integers, the first integer is 0, the second integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, the third integer is `a[2] - a[1]`, the fourth integer is `a[3] - a[2]`, and the fifth integer is `a[3] - a[2]`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains -q - 2 inputs, `v` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 0, `l` is `q`, `m` is the original value of `m` plus the value of `b` at index `s` - 1 plus the product of `bd` at index `s`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad` at index `s`, `ql` is the original value of `ql` minus the value of `a` at index `s` - 1, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the list `ad` has been updated to include a new element, which is the difference between the fourth and third elements of list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
