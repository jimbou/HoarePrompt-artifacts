Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least len(b), `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(b) - 1 integers are b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b)), `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains -1 inputs, `v` is a list containing four integers where the first integer is 0, the second integer is ad[1] / bd[1], the third integer is ad[2] / bd[2], and the fourth integer is ad[3] / bd[3], `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], `s` is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, and `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list, where `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
