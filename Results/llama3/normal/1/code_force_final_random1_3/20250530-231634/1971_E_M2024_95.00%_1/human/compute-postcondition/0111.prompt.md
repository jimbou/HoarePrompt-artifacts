Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains -q - 2 inputs, `v` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, `l` is `q`, `m` is the original value of `m` plus the value of `b` at index `s` - 1 plus the product of `bd` at index `s`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad` at index `s`, `ql` is the original value of `ql` minus the value of `a` at index `s` - 1, `s` is the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `i` is len(a) - 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `v` now contains the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b` for all elements in `a`, and the loop counter `i` has reached the last index of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in b, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains -q - 1 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 0, m is the original value of m plus b[s - 1] plus the product of bd[s], ql, and the reciprocal of ad[s], ql is the original value of ql minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, and the integer value of m is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in b, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains -q + 1 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 1, ql is an integer, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s], ql, and the inverse of ad[s], where ql is the difference between its original value and a[s - 1], and this is printed: the integer value of m, which is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s], ql, and the inverse of ad[s], where ql is the difference between its original value and a[s - 1]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in b, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains -q inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 2, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, m is m plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], and the integer value of m is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
