Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0 and the difference between the second and first elements in `b`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`, `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The list `b` remains unchanged. The list `bd` now contains two elements: the first element is 0, and the second element is the difference between the second and first elements in `b`.
