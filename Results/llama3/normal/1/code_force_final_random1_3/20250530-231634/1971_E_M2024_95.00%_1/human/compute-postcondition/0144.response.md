Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least len(b), `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(b) - 1 integers are b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b)), `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains -2 inputs, `v` is a list containing len(a) integers where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a)), `l` is 0, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], `s` is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, `i` is 1, and `m` is 0. The current value of a[s] is equal to ql, and the value of b[s] is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop.
