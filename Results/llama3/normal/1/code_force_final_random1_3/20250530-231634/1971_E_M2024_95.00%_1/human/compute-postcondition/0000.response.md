Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first a line with three integers n, k, and q, then a line with k integers a_i, then a line with k integers b_i, and finally q lines each with a single integer d. n and k are non-negative integers, 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= q <= 10^5, 1 <= a_i <= n, a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, a_k = n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 <= i <= k-1, and 0 <= d <= n. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` has been assigned a positive integer value from the input, and the remaining input in the stdin still contains multiple test cases with the same structure as before. The values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `d` are still constrained by the same conditions as in the initial state.
