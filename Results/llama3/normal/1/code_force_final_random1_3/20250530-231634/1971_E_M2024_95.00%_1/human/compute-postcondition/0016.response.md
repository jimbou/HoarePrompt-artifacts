Output State: `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `ad` is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0 and the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the last index of `b`

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the list `bd` now contains the differences between consecutive elements in list `b`, in addition to the initial 0. The value of `i` has also been updated to the last index of list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
