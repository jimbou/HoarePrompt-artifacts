Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in b, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains -q + 1 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 1, ql is an integer, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s], ql, and the inverse of ad[s], where ql is the difference between its original value and a[s - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated by adding the value of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]`, `ql`, and the inverse of `ad[s]`. The value of `ql` has also been updated by subtracting the value of `a[s - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
