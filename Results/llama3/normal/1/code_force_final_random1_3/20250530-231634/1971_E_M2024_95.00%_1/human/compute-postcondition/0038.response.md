Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, ad is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, m is 0, i is 1, l is 2, ql is an integer, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is reset to 0. The value of `i` is reset to 1. The value of `ql` is set to an integer input from stdin. The value of `s` is set to the insertion point for `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order. Stdin is now empty.
