Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, t is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains -3 inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, l is q, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is len(a) - 1, and nothing is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last integer is b[1] - b[0], `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -3 inputs, `v` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], `s` is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, the second integer is b[1] - b[0], and the third integer is b[2] - b[1], `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -3 inputs, `v` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], `s` is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, and `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least len(a), `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, and the last len(a) - 1 integers are a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a)), `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0, the second integer is b[1] - b[0], the third integer is b[2] - b[1], and the fourth integer is b[3] - b[2], `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains -3 inputs, `v` is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], `s` is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, and `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
