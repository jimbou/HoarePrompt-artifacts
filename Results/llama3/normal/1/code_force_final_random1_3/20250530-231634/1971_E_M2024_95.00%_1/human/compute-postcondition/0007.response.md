To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `a` has a length of at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must have a length of at least 3.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with a length of at least 3, `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, `ad` is a list containing three integers, the first integer is 0, the second integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, and the third integer is `a[2] - a[1]`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 3**
