Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It calculates the speed of the car between each pair of points and uses this information to determine the time it takes to reach a given point. The program handles all possible cases, including when the query point is exactly at one of the known points, and when it is between two known points. The use of binary search to find the appropriate segment for the query point is also correct.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs. The examples provided in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
