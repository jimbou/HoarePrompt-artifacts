Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four inputs: three integers n, k, and q, followed by k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q lines each with a single integer d. It then calculates the differences between consecutive elements in a_i and b_i, and uses these differences to compute the value of b_i corresponding to a given input d. The function prints the computed values for each test case, separated by spaces, and followed by a newline character.**
