Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 2, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 1, ad is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing a single integer 0, v is a list containing integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 0, m is the original value of m plus the value of b at index s - 1 plus the product of bd at index s, ql, and the reciprocal of ad at index s, ql is the original value of ql minus the value of a at index s - 1, i is 1, l is 3, s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

The code modifies the values of `m` and `ql`. The first line subtracts the value of `a` at index `s - 1` from `ql`. The second line adds the value of `b` at index `s - 1` to `m`. The third line adds the product of `bd` at index `s`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad` at index `s` to `m`. No other variables are affected.
