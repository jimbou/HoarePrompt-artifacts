Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, q is greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, b is a list of integers with a length of at least 2, ad is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing len(b) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the differences between consecutive elements in b, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains -q inputs, v is a list containing len(a) integers, the first integer is 0 and the rest are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 2, ql is an integer equal to the input value minus a[s - 1], s is the insertion point for ql in a to maintain sorted order, i is 1, m is m plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s].**

The code modifies the values of ql and m. The first line subtracts the value of a[s - 1] from ql. The second line adds the value of b[s - 1] to m. The third line adds the product of bd[s], ql, and the reciprocal of ad[s] to m. No other variables are affected.
