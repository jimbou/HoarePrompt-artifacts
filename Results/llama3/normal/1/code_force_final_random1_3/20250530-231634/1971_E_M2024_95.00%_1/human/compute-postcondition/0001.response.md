The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0**
