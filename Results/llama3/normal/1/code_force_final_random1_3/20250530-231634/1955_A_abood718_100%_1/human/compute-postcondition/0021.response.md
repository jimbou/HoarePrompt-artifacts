Output State: **`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers, `i` is 1, `X` is equal to half of `A`, stdin contains t-2 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-2 is greater than or equal to 0. Each of the following t-2 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `A`, `B`, `C` remain unchanged as positive integers, and `i` remains 1. A new variable `X` is introduced, which is equal to half of the value of `A`. The contents of the standard input (stdin) remain the same, containing t-2 lines of input, where each line consists of three positive integers n, a, and b, within the specified ranges.
