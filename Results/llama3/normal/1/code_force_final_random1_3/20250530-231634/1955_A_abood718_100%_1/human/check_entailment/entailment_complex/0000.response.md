Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * B) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C), it's more advantageous to buy each yogurt at the regular price. In this case, the program prints A * B, which is the total cost of buying A yogurts at the regular price.

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it's more advantageous to buy all yogurts at the promotion price. In this case, the program prints int(A * C / 2), which is the total cost of buying A/2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it's more advantageous to buy (A - 1) / 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price. In this case, the program prints X * C + B, where X is (A - 1) / 2.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the minimum cost of buying n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
