Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `B` is a positive integer, `C` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines, where t is a positive integer. Each of the following t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30**

Explanation: 
The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` reads the first line from stdin, which contains three positive integers, and assigns them to `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are now positive integers. The value of `i` remains 0. The stdin now contains t lines, where t is a positive integer. Each of the following t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.
