Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks the conditions to determine the minimum cost.

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * B) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C), it calculates the minimum cost as the price of n yogurts at the regular price (A * B).

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it calculates the minimum cost as the price of A/2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (A * C / 2).

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it calculates the minimum cost as the price of A//2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price plus the price of one yogurt at the regular price (X * C + B).

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
