Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts based on the promotion.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * B) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C), it's more advantageous to buy yogurts at the regular price. In this case, the program prints the total cost as A * B.

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it's more advantageous to buy yogurts at the promotion price. In this case, the program prints the total cost as A * C / 2.

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, the program calculates the total cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts at the promotion price as possible (A // 2), and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price (B). The total cost is X * C + B.

The program's logic correctly handles all possible scenarios, and the execution summary confirms that it produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
