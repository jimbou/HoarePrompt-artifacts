Output: **`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers, `i` is 1, `X` is equal to half of `A`, stdin contains t-2 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-2 is greater than or equal to 0. Each of the following t-2 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30, and this is printed: X * C + B, where X is half of A and A, B, C are positive integers.**
