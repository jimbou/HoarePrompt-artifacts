Output: **`A` is an odd number, `B` is larger than or equal to half of `C`, `C` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `X` is an integer, stdin contains t lines, where t is a positive integer. Each of the following t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30, and this is printed: X times C plus B**
