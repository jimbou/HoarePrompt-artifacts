Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t+1 lines, where t is a positive integer. The first line contains t. Each of the following t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers. `i` is 0. stdin contains t lines, where t is a positive integer. Each of the following t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B` is larger than or equal to half of `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer value of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the value of `X` times `C` plus `B` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-2 is greater than or equal to 0. Each of the following t-2 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the integer value of `A` multiplied by `C` and divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, `X` is equal to half of `A`, and the value of `X` multiplied by `C` plus `B` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers such that 1 <= A <= 100, 1 <= B <= 30, and 1 <= C <= 30, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-2 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-2 is greater than or equal to 0. Each of the following t-2 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30. If `B` * 2 < `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is being printed. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the integer value of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is being printed. If `A` is odd, the value of the expression `X` * `C` + `B` is being printed, where `X` is a positive integer such that 1 <= X <= 50.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
