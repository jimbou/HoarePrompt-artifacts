Output State: **`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers such that 1 <= A <= 100, 1 <= B <= 30, and 1 <= C <= 30, `i` is 2, `X` is a positive integer such that 1 <= X <= 50, stdin contains t-2 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-2 is greater than or equal to 0. Each of the following t-2 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.**

In this output state, the value of `X` is calculated as the integer division of `A` by 2, which results in a positive integer between 1 and 50. The values of `A`, `B`, `C`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the contents of stdin also remain the same.
