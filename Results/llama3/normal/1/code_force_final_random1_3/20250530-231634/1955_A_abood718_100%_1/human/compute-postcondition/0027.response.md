Output State: **`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers such that 1 <= A <= 100, 1 <= B <= 30, and 1 <= C <= 30, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-2 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-2 is greater than or equal to 0. Each of the following t-2 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.**

In this output state, the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to be the three positive integers read from the first line of the input, which are within the specified ranges. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The stdin now contains t-2 lines, as one line has been read and processed. The remaining lines still contain three positive integers each, within the specified ranges.
