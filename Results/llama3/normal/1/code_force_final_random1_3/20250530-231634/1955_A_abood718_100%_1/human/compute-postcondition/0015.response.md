The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and stdin. If `i` is less than the number of lines in stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines, where t is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and stdin must contain at least one more line.
State: **`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers. `i` is 1. stdin contains t-1 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-1 is greater than 0. Each of the following t-1 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.**
