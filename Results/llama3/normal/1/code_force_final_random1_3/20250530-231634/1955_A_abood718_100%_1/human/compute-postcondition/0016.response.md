Output State: **`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-2 is greater than or equal to 0. Each of the following t-2 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.**

In this output state, the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` have been updated to the three positive integers read from the first line of the input. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains t-2 lines, each with three positive integers n, a, and b, within the specified ranges.
