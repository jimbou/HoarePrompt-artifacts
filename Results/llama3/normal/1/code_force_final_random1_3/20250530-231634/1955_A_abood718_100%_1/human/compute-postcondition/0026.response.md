The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `stdin` so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `stdin`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains t-2 lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is 2 and `stdin` contains t-1 lines.
State: **`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-1 is greater than or equal to 1. Each of the following t-1 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.**
