Output: **`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers. `i` is 0. stdin contains t lines, where t is a positive integer. Each of the following t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30. `B` is larger than or equal to half of `C`. The current value of `A` is an even number, and the integer value of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is being printed**
