Output: **`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers such that 1 <= A <= 100, 1 <= B <= 30, and 1 <= C <= 30, `i` is 2, `X` is a positive integer such that 1 <= X <= 50, stdin contains t-2 lines, where t is a positive integer and t-2 is greater than or equal to 0. Each of the following t-2 lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30, and the value of the expression X * C + B is being printed**
