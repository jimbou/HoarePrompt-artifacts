The code prints the result of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`. To determine the exact output, let's analyze the variables involved:

*   `A` is a positive integer and is currently an even number.
*   `C` is a positive integer.
*   The expression `A * C / 2` involves multiplying `A` and `C`, then dividing the result by 2.

Since `A` is an even number, `A * C` will also be an even number (because any integer multiplied by an even number results in an even number). Dividing an even number by 2 will always result in an integer.

Therefore, the expression `int(A * C / 2)` will evaluate to an integer value, which is half of the product of `A` and `C`.

Output: **half of the product of A and C (where A is the current even value of A and C is the value of C)**
