Output State: **`A` is an odd number, `B` is larger than or equal to half of `C`, `C` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `X` is an integer, stdin contains t lines, where t is a positive integer. Each of the following t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30.**

In natural language, the output state is: `A` is still an odd number, `B` is still larger than or equal to half of `C`, and `C` is still a positive integer. The value of `i` remains 0. A new variable `X` is introduced, which is equal to half of `A`. The contents of stdin remain unchanged, containing t lines of three positive integers each.
