Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It first checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (B * 2) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (C). If it is, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts (A) by the regular price (B).

If buying two yogurts at the regular price is not cheaper, it checks if the number of yogurts (A) is even. If it is, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the promotion price (C) and dividing by 2.

If the number of yogurts is odd, it calculates the total cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (C), and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price (B).

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, when the number of yogurts is even, and when the number of yogurts is odd. Therefore, the program is correct.
