Output: **`A` is a positive integer, `B` is a positive integer, `C` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines, where t is a positive integer. Each of the following t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30. The current value of `B` is less than half of `C`, and the product of A and B is being printed**
