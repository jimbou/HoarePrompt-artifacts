Based on the initial state, we know that `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers, and `i` is 1. However, we don't have explicit values for `A` and `B`.

The print statement is `print(A * B)`, which will print the product of `A` and `B`.

Since we don't have explicit values for `A` and `B`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the product. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of the values of `A` and `B`.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are positive integers)**
