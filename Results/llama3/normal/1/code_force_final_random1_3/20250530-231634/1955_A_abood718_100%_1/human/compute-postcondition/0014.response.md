Postcondition: ***`A`, `B`, `C` are positive integers. `i` is 0. stdin contains t lines, where t is a positive integer. Each of the following t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a <= 30, and 1 <= b <= 30. If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. If `B` is larger than or equal to half of `C`, then if `A` is even, the integer value of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, the value of `X` times `C` plus `B` is printed.***
