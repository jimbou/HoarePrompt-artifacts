The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `sys.stdin.readline()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sys.stdin.readline()`. If `sys.stdin.readline()` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sys.stdin.readline()` is 0, so for the loop to execute again `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple inputs: the first line contains a single positive integer t greater than 0, and the function solve() has been executed.**
