To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. 

For the loop to execute, `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must evaluate to a value greater than 0. This means that the first line of the input must contain a positive integer. 

The state of the input data (the number of sets of input data, the values of n and k, and the edges of the graph) does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **stdin contains multiple inputs: the first line contains a single positive integer t**
