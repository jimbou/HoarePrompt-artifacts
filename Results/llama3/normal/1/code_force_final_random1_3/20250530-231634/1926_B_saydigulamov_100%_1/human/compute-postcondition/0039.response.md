Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases, input is empty, `_` is an integer equal to `a`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each of the strings input during the loop executions. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, 'SQUARE' is being printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute a number of times equal to the value of `a`, which is an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive). After the loop finishes executing, the value of `b` will be the last input string, and the value of `_` will be equal to `a`. The list `k` will contain the count of '1's in each of the strings input during the loop executions. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the program will print 'SQUARE', otherwise it will print 'TRIANGLE'. The standard input will be empty, and the input will be empty as well. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
