Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and the remaining test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains the same, which is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive). The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 0. A new variable `k` is introduced and assigned an empty list. The state of the stdin remains the same, containing multiple test cases, each test case containing `a` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and the remaining test cases.
