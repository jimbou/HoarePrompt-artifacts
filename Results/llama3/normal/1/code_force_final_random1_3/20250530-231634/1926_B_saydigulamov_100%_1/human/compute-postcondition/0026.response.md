To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `input()`.

The loop will execute if `input()` is not empty and can be converted to an integer. Since `stdin` contains no more test cases and `input` is empty, we need to adjust these states to ensure the loop can execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 1, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', `k` is an empty list, stdin contains at least one test case, input is not empty and can be converted to an integer, `_` is an integer**
