This function determines the shape of a figure composed of '1's in a grid of '0's and '1's. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of n characters. The function then analyzes the grid to determine whether the figure is a square or a triangle and prints the corresponding shape. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
