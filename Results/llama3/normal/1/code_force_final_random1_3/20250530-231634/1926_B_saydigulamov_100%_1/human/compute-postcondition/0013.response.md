Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a-3` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and at least one more test case, input is not empty. If '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b` plus the count of '1's in the current string `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to a new string of `a` characters '0' or '1' from the input. The value of `k` depends on whether '1' is present in the new string `b`. If '1' is present, `k` contains the count of '1's in the new string `b` plus the count of '1's in the previous string `b`. If '1' is not present, `k` is an empty list. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less test case, with `a-3` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and at least one more test case.
