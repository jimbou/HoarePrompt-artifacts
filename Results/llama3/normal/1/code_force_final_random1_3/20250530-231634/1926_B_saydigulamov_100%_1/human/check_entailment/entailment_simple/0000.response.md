Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `a` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and initializes an empty list `k`.
3. It then reads each row of the grid and counts the number of '1's in each row. If a row contains at least one '1', it appends the count to the list `k`.
4. After reading all rows, it checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

The program's logic is correct because:

* If the shape is a square, the number of '1's in each row will be the same, so `k[0] == k[1]` will be True.
* If the shape is a triangle, the number of '1's in each row will increase or decrease by 1, so `k[0] != k[1]` will be True.

The program assumes that the input is valid, i.e., the grid contains exactly one triangle or square with all '1's, and the size of the shape is greater than 1. This assumption is justified by the problem statement.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle.

Correctness: **True**
