Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and the remaining test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, if '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b`, otherwise `k` is an empty list, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a-1` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and the remaining test cases, input is not empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a-2` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and at least one more test case, input is not empty. If '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b` plus the count of '1's in the current string `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a-3` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and at least one more test case, input is not empty. If '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b` plus the count of '1's in the current string `b`. If '1' is not in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the current string `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
