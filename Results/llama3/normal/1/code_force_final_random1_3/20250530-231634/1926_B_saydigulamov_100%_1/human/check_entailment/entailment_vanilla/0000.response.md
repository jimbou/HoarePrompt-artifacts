Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of '1's in each row of the grid and storing them in a list `k`. It then checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal. If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement defines a triangle as a shape consisting of k consecutive rows, where the i-th row has 2*i-1 consecutive characters '1', and the central 1s are located in one column. The program does not check for this condition. It only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle or a square.

For example, consider the following grid:

0000
0000
0100
1110

The program will print 'TRIANGLE' for this grid, but it is actually a square.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
