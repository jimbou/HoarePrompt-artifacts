Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 1, `b` is a string of input, `k` is a list, stdin contains at least one test case, input is not empty and can be converted to an integer, `_` is an integer. If '1' is in `b`, `k` contains the count of '1' in string `b`.***
