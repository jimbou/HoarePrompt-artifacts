Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 2, `b` is a string containing a valid integer, `_` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, stdin contains at least one test case. If the digit '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of digit '1' in string `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.***
