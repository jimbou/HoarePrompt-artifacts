Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases, input is empty, `_` is an integer equal to `a`, `k` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been changed to an empty list, and the other variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' is no longer applicable since `k` is now empty.
