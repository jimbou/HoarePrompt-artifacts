To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `input()`. The loop will execute if `input()` is not empty and contains a valid integer. Since `a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, and `_` is an integer equal to `a`, we can adjust the state of `_` to be within the same range.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case, input is not empty and contains a valid integer, `_` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `k` is an empty list**
