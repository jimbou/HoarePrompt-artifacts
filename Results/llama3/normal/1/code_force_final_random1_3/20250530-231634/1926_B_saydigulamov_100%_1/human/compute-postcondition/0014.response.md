Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a-3` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and at least one more test case, input is not empty. If '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b` plus the count of '1's in the current string `b`. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the current string `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to include the count of '1's in the current string `b`. If '1' is in string `b`, the count of '1's in string `b` is added to the list `k`. Otherwise, the count of '1's in the current string `b` is added to the list `k`. The values of `a`, `i`, and `b` remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases.
