Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a-1` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and the remaining test cases, input is not empty**

In this output state, the value of `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', which is the first line of the first test case. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case now has `a-1` lines remaining, each containing `a` characters '0' or '1'. The values of `a`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.
