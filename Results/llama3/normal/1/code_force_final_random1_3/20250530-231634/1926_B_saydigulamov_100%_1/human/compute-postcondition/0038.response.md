Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case, input is not empty and can be converted to an integer, `_` is 2. If '1' is in `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.***
