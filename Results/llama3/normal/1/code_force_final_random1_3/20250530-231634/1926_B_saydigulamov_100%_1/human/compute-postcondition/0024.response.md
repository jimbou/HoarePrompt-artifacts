The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 1, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains no more test cases, input is empty. If '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b` plus the count of '1's in the current string `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, 'SQUARE' is being printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is being printed.**
