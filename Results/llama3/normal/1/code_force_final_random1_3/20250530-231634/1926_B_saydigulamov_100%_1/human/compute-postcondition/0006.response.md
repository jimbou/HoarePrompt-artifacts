Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b`, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1' containing at least one '1', stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a-1` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and the remaining test cases, input is not empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains the same, `i` is still 0, the list `k` now contains the count of '1's in the string `b`, the string `b` remains the same, and the input in stdin is still the same, containing multiple test cases with `a-1` lines each and the remaining test cases.
