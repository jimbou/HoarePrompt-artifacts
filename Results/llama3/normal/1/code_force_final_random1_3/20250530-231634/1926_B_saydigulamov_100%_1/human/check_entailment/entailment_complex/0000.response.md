Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. 

Here's why:

- The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself.
- It then counts the number of '1's in each row of the grid and stores these counts in a list `k`.
- If the first two elements of `k` are equal, it means that the shape is a square because the first two rows of a square have the same number of '1's. In this case, it prints 'SQUARE'.
- If the first two elements of `k` are not equal, it means that the shape is a triangle because the first two rows of a triangle have different numbers of '1's. In this case, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

This logic is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.

Correctness: **True**
