Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and the remaining test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains no more test cases, input is empty. If '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b` plus the count of '1's in the current string `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, 'SQUARE' is being printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases, input is empty, `_` is an integer equal to `a`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each of the strings input during the loop executions. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, 'SQUARE' is printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 2, `b` is a string containing a valid integer from stdin, `_` is 0, stdin contains no more test cases. If the digit '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of digit '1' in string `b` plus one more count of digit '1' in string `b` for each iteration of the loop. If the current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`, 'SQUARE' is printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is printed. If the digit '1' is not in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing one zero for each iteration of the loop. If the current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`, 'SQUARE' is printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
