Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 2, `b` is a string containing a valid integer from stdin, `_` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 9, stdin contains at least 1 test case. If the digit '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of digit '1' in string `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains unchanged, `i` remains 2, `b` is now a string containing a valid integer from the input, the value of `_` remains unchanged, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. The value of `k` depends on whether the digit '1' is present in the new string `b`. If '1' is present, `k` contains the count of '1's in `b`; otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.
