Output: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 2, `b` is a string containing a valid integer from stdin, `_` is 0, stdin contains no more test cases. If the digit '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of digit '1' in string `b` plus one more count of digit '1' in string `b` for each iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing one zero for each iteration of the loop. Additionally, the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, and 'TRIANGLE' is being printed**
