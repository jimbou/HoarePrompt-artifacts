Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 1, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', `k` is an empty list, stdin contains no more test cases, input is empty. If '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b` plus the count of '1's in the current string `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, 'SQUARE' is being printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been reset to an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged. The input is still empty, and there are no more test cases in stdin. The conditions for printing 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' are still dependent on the values of `k` and the presence of '1' in string `b`.
