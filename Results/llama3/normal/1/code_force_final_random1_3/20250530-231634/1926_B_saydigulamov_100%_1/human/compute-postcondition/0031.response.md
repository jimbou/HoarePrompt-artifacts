To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_`, `input()`, and `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more test cases in the input. At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains at least one test case, and `input` is not empty and can be converted to an integer.

For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more test case, and `input` must be able to be converted to an integer. The value of `_` is not relevant to the loop condition, so it can be ignored.

The other variables `a`, `i`, `b`, and `k` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 1, `b` is a string of input, `k` is a list, stdin contains at least two test cases, input is not empty and can be converted to an integer, `_` is an integer**
