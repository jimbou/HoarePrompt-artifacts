Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is an empty string, stdin contains no more test cases, input is empty, `_` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each of the strings input during the loop executions. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, 'SQUARE' is printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is equal to the initial value of `a`. The input buffer is empty, and there are no more test cases to process. The list `k` contains the count of '1's in each of the strings input during the loop executions. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the program prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
