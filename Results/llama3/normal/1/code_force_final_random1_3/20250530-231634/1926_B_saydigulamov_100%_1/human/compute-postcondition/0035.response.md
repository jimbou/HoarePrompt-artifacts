The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, stdin contains at least one test case, input is not empty and can be converted to an integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ is 2 and stdin contains at least two test cases.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, if '1' is in `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. stdin contains at least two test cases, input is not empty and can be converted to an integer, `_` is 2**
