Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, if '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b`, otherwise `k` is an empty list, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a-2` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and at least one more test case, input is not empty**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to a string of `a` characters '0' or '1' from the input. The values of `a`, `i`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains `a-2` lines of input for the current test case, and at least one more test case.
