The code `a = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines each containing n characters '0' or '1'. The first integer of the first test case is assigned to `a`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `a` lines each containing `a` characters '0' or '1', and the remaining test cases.**
