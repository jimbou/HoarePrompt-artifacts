Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. It only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is the same, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

The program will output "TRIANGLE", but the correct output should be "TRIANGLE" because the shape is a triangle with 3 rows.

The program does not check the pattern of the '1's in the grid, it only checks the number of '1's in the first two rows. This is not enough to determine the shape of the grid.

A correct program should check the pattern of the '1's in the grid, for example, it should check if the number of '1's in each row is increasing by 2 for a triangle, or if the number of '1's in each row is the same for a square.
