Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `b` is a string of `a` characters '0' or '1', stdin contains no more test cases, input is empty. If '1' is in string `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in string `b` plus the count of '1's in the current string `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list. The current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`.**
