Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `resultats` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first three integers in the first sublist, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`**.

In this output state, the value of `total_points` is calculated by adding the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are the first three integers in the first sublist of `cas_de_test`. The other variables remain unchanged.
