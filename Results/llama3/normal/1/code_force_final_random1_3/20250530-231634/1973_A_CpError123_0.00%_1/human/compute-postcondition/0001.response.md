According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cas_de_test`. If the list has at least 1 sublist the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `resultats` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 sublist and the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first three integers in the first sublist.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `resultats` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first three integers in the first sublist**
