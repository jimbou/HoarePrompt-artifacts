This function calculates the number of equalities for each set of three integers in a list of test cases. It takes a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order. For each set of three integers, it calculates the total points, total matches, and equalities. If the total points are odd, or the total matches are more than 3, or the third integer is greater than the total matches, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the integer division of equalities by 2. The function returns a list of results, one for each set of three integers in the input list.
