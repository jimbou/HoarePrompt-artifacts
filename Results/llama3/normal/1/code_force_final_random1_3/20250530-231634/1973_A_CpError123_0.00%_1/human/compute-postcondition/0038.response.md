Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least t sublists, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the t-th sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 // 2, egalites is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), resultats is a list containing t elements, where each element is either -1 or egalites // 2, depending on the values of total_points, total_matchs, and egalites.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is still a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is still a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least `t` sublists. The variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites` are updated to their values in the `t`-th sublist. The `resultats` list contains `t` elements, where each element is either -1 or `egalites // 2`, depending on the values of `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites`.
