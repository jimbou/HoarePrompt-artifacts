Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first three integers in the first sublist, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, if `total_points` is an odd number, `resultats` is a list containing a single element -1. Otherwise, `resultats` is an empty list. The current value of `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or the current value of `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`***
