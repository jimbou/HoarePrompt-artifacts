Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three players. It first checks if the total number of points is even, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid. Then, it calculates the total number of matches played, which must be less than or equal to 3. If these conditions are not met, the program returns -1, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.

If the scores are valid, the program calculates the number of draws by subtracting the number of wins and losses from the total number of points. The number of wins and losses is calculated by subtracting the points of the first and second players from the points of the third player, respectively. The result is then divided by 2 to get the number of draws.

The program correctly handles all the examples provided, including the edge cases where the scores are not valid. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
