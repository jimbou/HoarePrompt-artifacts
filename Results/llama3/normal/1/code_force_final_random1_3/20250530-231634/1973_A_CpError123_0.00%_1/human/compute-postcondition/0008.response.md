Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the first sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to total_points // 2, resultats is a list containing two elements -1.**

The code block consists of two lines: `resultats.append(-1)` and `continue`. The first line appends the value -1 to the list `resultats`. Since `resultats` initially contains a single element -1, after this line, it will contain two elements -1. The second line, `continue`, does not affect any variables but skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, the final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and the value of `resultats` is updated to contain two elements -1.
