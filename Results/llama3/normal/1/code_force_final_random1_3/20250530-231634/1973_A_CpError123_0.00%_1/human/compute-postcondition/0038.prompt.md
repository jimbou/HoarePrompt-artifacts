Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, `resultats` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the first sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to total_points // 2, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1). If egalites is less than 0, resultats is a list containing three elements -1. If egalites is larger than or equal to 0, and total_matchs is larger than 3 or p3 is larger than total_matchs, resultats is a list containing three elements -1 and egalites // 2. Otherwise, resultats is a list containing one element egalites // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 2 sublists, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first three integers in the second sublist, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3 // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing four elements -1 if `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, otherwise if `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is less than 0, `resultats` is a list containing three elements -1, if `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is larger than or equal to 0, and `p1 + p2 + p3 // 2` is larger than 3 or `p3` is larger than `p1 + p2 + p3 // 2`, `resultats` is a list containing three elements -1 and `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) // 2`, otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing one element `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) // 2`, and if `total_matchs` is larger than 3 or `p3` is larger than `total_matchs`, `resultats` has an additional -1 appended to it, and if `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` has an additional -1 appended to it, otherwise, `resultats` has an additional element `egalites // 2` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 3 sublists, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the third sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 // 2, egalites is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), resultats is a list containing four elements -1 if p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, otherwise if p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) is less than 0, resultats is a list containing three elements -1, if p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) is larger than or equal to 0, and p1 + p2 + p3 // 2 is larger than 3 or p3 is larger than p1 + p2 + p3 // 2, resultats is a list containing three elements -1 and p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) // 2, otherwise, resultats is a list containing one element p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) // 2, and if total_matchs is larger than 3 or p3 is larger than total_matchs, resultats has an additional -1 appended to it, and if egalites is less than 0, resultats has an additional -1 appended to it, otherwise, resultats has an additional element egalites // 2 appended to it, and if total_points is odd, resultats has an additional -1 appended to it, and if total_matchs is larger than 3 or p3 is larger than total_matchs, resultats has an additional -1 appended to it, and resultats has an additional -1 appended to it if egalites is less than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
