Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 3 sublists, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the third sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 // 2, egalites is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), resultats is a list containing four elements -1 if p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, otherwise if p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) is less than 0, resultats is a list containing three elements -1, if p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) is larger than or equal to 0, and p1 + p2 + p3 // 2 is larger than 3 or p3 is larger than p1 + p2 + p3 // 2, resultats is a list containing three elements -1 and p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) // 2, otherwise, resultats is a list containing one element p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) // 2, and if total_matchs is larger than 3 or p3 is larger than total_matchs, resultats has an additional -1 appended to it, and if egalites is less than 0, resultats has an additional -1 appended to it, otherwise, resultats has an additional element egalites // 2 appended to it, and resultats has an additional -1 appended to it.**

The code appends an additional -1 to the resultats list, regardless of the previous values of the variables. This is the only change made by the code, and all other variables remain unchanged.
