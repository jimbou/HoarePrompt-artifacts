Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, `resultats` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The `cas_de_test` list also remains unchanged, with each sublist containing three integers between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are still sorted in non-decreasing order. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `resultats`, which is assigned an empty list.
