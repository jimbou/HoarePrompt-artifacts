Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 2 sublists, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the second sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to total_points // 2, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), resultats is a list containing four elements -1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends -1 to the list `resultats`. The second line is a `continue` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

The initial state is not modified by the code, except for the list `resultats`, which now contains four elements -1.
