Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first three integers in the first sublist, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, if `total_points` is an odd number, `resultats` is a list containing a single element -1. Otherwise, `resultats` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `total_matchs` has been updated to be equal to half of `total_points`, which is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `cas_de_test` still contains at least one sublist, and the integers in each sublist are still sorted in non-decreasing order. The value of `resultats` is still dependent on whether `total_points` is odd or even.
