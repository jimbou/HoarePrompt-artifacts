Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first three integers in the first sublist, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `egalites` is larger than or equal to 0, `egalites` is larger than or equal to 0, If `total_matchs` is larger than 3 or `p3` is larger than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing three elements -1 and `egalites // 2`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing one element `egalites // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `egalites` is divided by 2 and appended to the list `resultats`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `resultats` now contains either two elements -1 and `egalites // 2` or one element `egalites // 2`, depending on the values of `total_matchs` and `p3`.
