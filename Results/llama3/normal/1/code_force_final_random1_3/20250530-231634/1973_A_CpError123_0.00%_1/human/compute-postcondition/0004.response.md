Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, resultats is a list containing a single element -1, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the first sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, and the current value of total_points is an odd number.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `resultats.append(-1)` and `continue`. The first line appends the value -1 to the `resultats` list, which was initially empty. The second line, `continue`, does not affect any variables or the state of the program, as it is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in this code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the `resultats` list, which now contains a single element, -1. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `total_points` remain the same as in the initial state.
