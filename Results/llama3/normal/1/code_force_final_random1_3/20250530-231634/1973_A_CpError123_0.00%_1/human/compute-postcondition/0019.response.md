Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 2 sublists, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the second sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to total_points // 2, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1). If total_points is odd, resultats is a list containing four elements -1. Otherwise, if egalites is less than 0, resultats is a list containing three elements -1. If egalites is larger than or equal to 0, and total_matchs is larger than 3 or p3 is larger than total_matchs, resultats is a list containing three elements -1 and egalites // 2. Otherwise, resultats is a list containing one element egalites // 2.***
