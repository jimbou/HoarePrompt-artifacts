Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program first checks if the total points (sum of the scores of the three players) is odd. If it is, the program returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario. Then, it calculates the total number of matches played, which is half of the total points. If the total number of matches is more than 3 or the score of the third player is greater than the total number of matches, the program returns -1, as this is also not a valid scenario.

If the total points and total matches are valid, the program calculates the number of equalities (draws) by subtracting twice the difference between the score of the third player and the score of the second player, and twice the difference between the score of the third player and the score of the first player, from the total points. If the number of equalities is negative, the program returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the integer division of the number of equalities by 2.

The program correctly handles all the possible scenarios and returns the maximum number of draws that could have happened for each test case. Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
