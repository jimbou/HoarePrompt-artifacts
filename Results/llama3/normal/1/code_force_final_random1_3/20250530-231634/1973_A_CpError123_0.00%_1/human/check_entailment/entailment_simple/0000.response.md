Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program first checks if the total number of points is odd, in which case it is impossible to have a valid set of games and results, and appends -1 to the result list. It then calculates the total number of matches and checks if it is greater than 3 or if the maximum score is greater than the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it appends -1 to the result list.

If the total number of points is even and the total number of matches is not greater than 3, the program calculates the number of draws by subtracting twice the difference between the maximum score and the other two scores from the total number of points. If the result is negative, it appends -1 to the result list. Otherwise, it appends the integer division of the result by 2 to the result list.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of integer division to calculate the number of draws is also correct, as it ensures that the result is an integer.

Correctness: **True**
