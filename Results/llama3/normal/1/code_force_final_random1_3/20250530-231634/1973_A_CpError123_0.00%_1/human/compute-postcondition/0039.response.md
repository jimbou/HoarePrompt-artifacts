Output State: **The program returns a list of t elements, where each element is either -1 or the integer division of egalites by 2, depending on the values of total_points, total_matchs, and egalites, which are calculated based on the first three integers in the t-th sublist of cas_de_test, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order.**
