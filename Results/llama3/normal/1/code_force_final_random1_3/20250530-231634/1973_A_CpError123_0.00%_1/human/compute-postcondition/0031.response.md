Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 3 sublists, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first three integers in the third sublist, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3 // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing four elements -1 if `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, otherwise if `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is less than 0, `resultats` is a list containing three elements -1, if `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is larger than or equal to 0, and `p1 + p2 + p3 // 2` is larger than 3 or `p3` is larger than `p1 + p2 + p3 // 2`, `resultats` is a list containing three elements -1 and `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) // 2`, otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing one element `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) // 2`, and if `total_matchs` is larger than 3 or `p3` is larger than `total_matchs`, `resultats` has an additional -1 appended to it, and if `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` has an additional -1 appended to it, otherwise, `resultats` has an additional element `egalites // 2` appended to it, and if `total_points` is odd, `resultats` has an additional -1 appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `total_matchs` is now explicitly calculated as `total_points // 2`, which is equal to `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
