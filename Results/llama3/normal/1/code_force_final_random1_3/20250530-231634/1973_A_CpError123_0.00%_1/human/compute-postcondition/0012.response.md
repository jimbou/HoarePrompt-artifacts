Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the first sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to total_points // 2, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), egalites is less than 0, and resultats is a list containing three elements -1.**

In natural language, the output state is: t is still a positive integer, cas_de_test remains a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist. p1, p2, p3 are still the first three integers in the first sublist. total_points is still equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is still equal to total_points // 2, egalites is still equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), and egalites is still less than 0. However, resultats is now a list containing three elements -1, because we appended -1 to resultats.
