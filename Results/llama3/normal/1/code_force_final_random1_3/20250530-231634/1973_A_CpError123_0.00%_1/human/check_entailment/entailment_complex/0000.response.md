Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program first checks if the total points (sum of the three scores) is odd. If it is, the program returns -1, as it is not possible to have an odd number of points in a series of games where each game can result in either a win (2 points), a loss (0 points), or a draw (1 point each).

Next, the program calculates the total number of matches (total_points // 2) and checks if it is greater than 3 or if the third score (p3) is greater than the total number of matches. If either condition is true, the program returns -1, as it is not possible to have more than 3 matches or for the third player to have more points than the total number of matches.

Finally, the program calculates the number of equalities (egalites) using the formula: total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1). If the number of equalities is negative, the program returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the integer division of the number of equalities by 2.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
