Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes into account the scores of the three players, which are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first checks if the total number of points is odd. If it is, the program immediately returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario (since each game can only result in an even number of points being awarded).

2. The program then calculates the total number of matches that must have been played. This is done by dividing the total number of points by 2, since each match results in 2 points being awarded.

3. The program checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (p3) is greater than the total number of matches. If either of these conditions is true, the program returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario (since each player can only play a maximum of 3 matches, and the highest score cannot exceed the total number of matches).

4. The program then calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. This is done by subtracting twice the difference between the highest score (p3) and the middle score (p2), and twice the difference between the highest score (p3) and the lowest score (p1), from the total number of points. This effectively calculates the number of points that must have been awarded as draws.

5. If the calculated number of draws is negative, the program returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario. Otherwise, the program returns the calculated number of draws divided by 2, since each draw results in 2 points being awarded.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly handles all possible scenarios and returns the maximum number of draws that could have happened in each case.

Correctness: **True**
