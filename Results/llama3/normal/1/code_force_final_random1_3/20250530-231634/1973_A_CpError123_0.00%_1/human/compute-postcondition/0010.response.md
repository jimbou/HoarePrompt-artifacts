Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, where each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the integers in each sublist are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, p1, p2, p3 are the first three integers in the first sublist, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to total_points // 2, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), If total_matchs is larger than 3 or p3 is larger than total_matchs, resultats is a list containing two elements -1. Otherwise, resultats is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of egalites is calculated based on the values of total_points, p1, p2, and p3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of egalites is a combination of the values of total_points, p1, p2, and p3, which are all defined in the initial state.
