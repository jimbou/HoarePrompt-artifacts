Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is the first element of the test case, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. If `next_year` is divisible by the last element in `a`, then `next_year` is `next_year + last element in a`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than the previous value of `next_year`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `a`, and the final value of `next_year` and `current_year` is determined by the last element in `a`. If the last element in `a` divides `next_year` evenly, then `next_year` is incremented by the last element in `a`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than the previous value of `next_year`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
