Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second last element of `a`, `n` is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable `n`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, and `current_year` is not divisible by `ai`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` is calculated as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `next_year` is now the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
