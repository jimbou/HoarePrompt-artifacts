To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `ai` and the list `a`. 

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element. Since `ai` is the last element of `a` before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state of `a` to have at least one more element for the loop to execute. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second last element of `a`, `current_year` is 0, `n` is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable `n`**
