Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case. `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. If `next_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous value of `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_year` is updated to be equal to the value of `next_year`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `next_year` is still dependent on whether it is divisible by `ai` or not, but now `current_year` has the same value as `next_year`.
