Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list that contains the value of next_year, test is the second test case in the list, a is an empty list, ai is not defined, n is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable n, current_year is equal to next_year which is either current_year + ai if current_year is divisible by ai, or the smallest multiple of ai that is greater than current_year otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'a' is empty, 'ai' is not defined because there are no more elements in 'a' to iterate over, and 'current_year' is the final value of 'next_year' after all iterations. The other variables 't', 'test_cases', 'results', 'test', and 'n' remain unchanged.
