Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is the first element of the test case, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.**

The code appends the value of `current_year` to the `results` list. Since `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, the `results` list now contains the value of `next_year` twice. The values of the other variables are not affected.
