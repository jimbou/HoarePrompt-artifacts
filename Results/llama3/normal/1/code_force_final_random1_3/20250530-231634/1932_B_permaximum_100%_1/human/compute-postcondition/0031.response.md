Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second last element of `a`, `n` is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable `n`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables keep their initial values except for `current_year` which is now equal to `next_year`. The value of `next_year` depends on whether `current_year` is divisible by `ai` or not. If it is, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
