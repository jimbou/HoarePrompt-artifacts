#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers, where the first element of each inner list is a positive integer n, and the rest of the elements are n positive integers.
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        
        results.append(current_year)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `current_year` for each test case in the original `test_cases` list, `test` is not defined, `n` is not defined, `a` is not defined, `ai` is not defined, `current_year` is not defined, `next_year` is not defined.
    return results
    #The program returns an empty list `results` that contains no values of `current_year` for each test case in the original `test_cases` list because `test_cases` is an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer n and n positive integers, and returns a list of values representing the current year for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, calculates the next year based on the given integers, and appends the final current year to the results list. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.
