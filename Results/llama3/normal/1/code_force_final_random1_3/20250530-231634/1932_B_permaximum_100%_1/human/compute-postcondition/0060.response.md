Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case. `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous value of `next_year`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `current_year` and `next_year` is still maintained, with `current_year` being equal to the new value of `next_year`.
