Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. This is because the expression `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` calculates the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
