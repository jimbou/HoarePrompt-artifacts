Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list that contains the value of `current_year`, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element of `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year` otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_year` has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer, `test_cases` still having at least one test case, `test` still being the first test case, `n` still being the first element of the first test case, `a` still having at least one element, and `ai` still being the last element of `a`. The relationship between `current_year` and `next_year` remains the same.
