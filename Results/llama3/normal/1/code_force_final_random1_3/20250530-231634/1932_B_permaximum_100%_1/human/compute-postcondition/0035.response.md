Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the last element of `a`, `n` is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable `n`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.***
