According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is the second element of the first test case, which means it is a list of positive integers. However, we need to ensure that `a` has at least 1 element for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to have at least 1 element.

Additionally, since `ai` is the loop variable, we need to initialize it to the first element of `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of `a`, `current_year` is 0**
