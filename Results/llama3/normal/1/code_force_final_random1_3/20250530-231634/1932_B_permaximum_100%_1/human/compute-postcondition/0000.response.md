Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers, where the first element of each inner list is a positive integer `n`, and the rest of the elements are `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `results` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables, `t` and `test_cases`, remain unchanged. The list `test_cases` still contains lists of positive integers, where the first element of each inner list is a positive integer `n`, and the rest of the elements are `n` positive integers.
