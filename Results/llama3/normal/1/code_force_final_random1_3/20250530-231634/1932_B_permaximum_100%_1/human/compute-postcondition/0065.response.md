Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `current_year` for each test case in the original `test_cases` list, `test` is not defined, `n` is not defined, `a` is not defined, `ai` is not defined, `current_year` is not defined, `next_year` is not defined.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the `test_cases` list is exhausted, and the `results` list contains the final `current_year` value for each test case. The variables `test`, `n`, `a`, `ai`, `current_year`, and `next_year` are no longer defined, as they were only used within the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the loop.
