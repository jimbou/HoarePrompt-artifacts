To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `test` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If the list has at least 3 test cases, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 test cases, and `test` must be the third test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, `n` is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable `n`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise.**
