Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of signs and calculates the year when each sign will occur, taking into account the periodicity of each sign. The program correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, and also handles the case where the current year is not a multiple of the sign's periodicity.

The program uses the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` to calculate the next year when the sign will occur, which is correct. This formula ensures that the next year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity, and also ensures that the next year is greater than the current year.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input list of signs is empty, as it will simply return an empty list of results.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
