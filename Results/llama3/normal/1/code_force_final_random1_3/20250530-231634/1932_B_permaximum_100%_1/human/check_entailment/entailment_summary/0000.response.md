Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it iterates through the list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs. It calculates the next year based on the current year and the periodicity of the current sign. If the current year is a multiple of the periodicity, it adds the periodicity to the current year to get the next year. Otherwise, it calculates the next year by dividing the current year by the periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and multiplying by the periodicity.

The program correctly handles the case where the input list of test cases is empty, returning an empty list.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
