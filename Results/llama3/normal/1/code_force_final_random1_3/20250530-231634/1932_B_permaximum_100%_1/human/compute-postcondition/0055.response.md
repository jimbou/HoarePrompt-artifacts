Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous value of `current_year`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than its previous value, which was equal to `current_year`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `test`, `a`, `ai`, and `n` remain unchanged.
