Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list that contains the value of next_year and current_year, test is the third test case in the list, a is a list of positive integers, n is the first element of the test case, current_year is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case. `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. If `next_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous value of `current_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case. `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. If `next_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `next_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous value of `next_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
