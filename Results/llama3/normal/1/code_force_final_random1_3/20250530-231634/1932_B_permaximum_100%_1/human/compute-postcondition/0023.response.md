To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for test in test_cases:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `test` and `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test` is the first test case in the list, and `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case.

For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `test_cases` to have at least 2 test cases.

Additionally, since `test` is the first test case in the list, we need to adjust its state to be the second test case in the list.

The other variables (`t`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `ai`, `current_year`, and `next_year`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element of `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year` otherwise.**
