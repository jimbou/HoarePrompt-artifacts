Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer `n` and `n` positive integers, and returns a list of values representing the current year for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, calculates the next year based on the given integers, and appends the final current year to the results list.

The logic of the function is correct. It correctly calculates the next year by checking if the current year is a multiple of the given integer `ai`. If it is, the next year is the current year plus `ai`. If it's not, the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current year. This is done by dividing the current year by `ai`, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by `ai`.

The function also correctly handles the case where the input list of test cases is empty, returning an empty list.

Correctness: **True**
