Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second last element of `a`, `n` is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable `n`, and `next_year` is equal to `current_year + ai`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` is calculated by adding the value of `ai` to the current value of `current_year`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `next_year` is now a new multiple of `ai` since `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`.
