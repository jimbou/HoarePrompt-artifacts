Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of `a`. If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, then `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.***
