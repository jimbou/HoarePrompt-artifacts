To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of `a`.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `ai` must be the second element of `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise.**
