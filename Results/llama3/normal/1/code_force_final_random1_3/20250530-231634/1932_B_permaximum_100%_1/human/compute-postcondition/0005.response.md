Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of `a`, `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, and `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be the sum of the current year and the first element of the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current year is still a multiple of the first element of `a`, and the list of test cases, results, and other variables are unaffected by the execution of the code.
