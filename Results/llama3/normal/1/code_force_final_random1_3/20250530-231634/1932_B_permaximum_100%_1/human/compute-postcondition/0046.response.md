To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case, and `current_year` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least 1 element and `ai` is the first element in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case, `current_year` is 0**
