Functionality: **This function takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer n and n positive integers, and returns a list of values representing the current year for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, calculates the next year based on the given integers, and appends the final current year to the results list. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.**
