Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case, `current_year` is 0 and it is divisible by `ai`, `next_year` is `ai`**.

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be equal to `ai`, which is the first element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `current_year` is still 0 and it is still divisible by `ai`.
