Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, `n` is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable `n`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_year` has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer, `test_cases` still having at least 2 test cases, `test` still being the second test case, `a` still being an empty list, `ai` still being undefined, and `n` still being the first element of the test case.
