Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least `n` elements, `ai` is the last element of `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year` otherwise.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `test`, and `n` as in the initial state. The list `a` will have at least `n` elements, and `ai` will be the last element of `a`. The value of `current_year` will be the result of the last iteration of the loop, which is either the current year plus the last element of `a` if the current year is a multiple of the last element of `a`, or the smallest multiple of the last element of `a` that is greater than or equal to the current year otherwise.
