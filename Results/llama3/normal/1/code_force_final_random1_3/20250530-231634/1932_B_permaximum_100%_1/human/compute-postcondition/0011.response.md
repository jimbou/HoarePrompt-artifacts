Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is `current_year + ai`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be `current_year + ai`, which means it is now equal to `current_year` plus the second element of the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
