Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the last element of `a`, `n` is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable `n`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be equal to `current_year + ai`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `results` still contains the value of `next_year`, but this value has been updated. The test case `test` and the list `a` are unchanged, and `n` is still the first element of the test case. The relationship between `current_year` and `next_year` is also updated, as `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, which is `current_year + ai`.
