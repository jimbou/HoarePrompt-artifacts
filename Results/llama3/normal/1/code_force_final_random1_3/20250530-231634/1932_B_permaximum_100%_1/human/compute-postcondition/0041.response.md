Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 4 elements, `ai` is the fourth element of `a`, `n` is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable `n`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`. This means that the value of `current_year` has been updated to be the same as `next_year`, which is either the current year plus the fourth element of `a` (if the current year is divisible by that element), or the smallest multiple of that element that is greater than the current year (otherwise). All other variables remain unchanged.
