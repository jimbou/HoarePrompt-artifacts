Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list that contains the value of current_year, test is the second test case in the list, a is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, ai is the last element of a, current_year is 0, n is the first element of the test case assigned to the variable n, a is the list of positive integers assigned to the variable a.**

The code snippet assigns the second test case in `test_cases` to the variable `test`, then unpacks the first element of `test` to the variable `n` and the rest of the elements to the variable `a`. The variable `current_year` is reset to 0. The value of `ai` remains the last element of `a`, and the relationship between `current_year` and `next_year` is no longer relevant since `current_year` is now 0. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.
