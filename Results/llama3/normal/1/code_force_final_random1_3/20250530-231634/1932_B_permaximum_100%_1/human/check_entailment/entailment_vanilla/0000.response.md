Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and stores it in the variable `t`.

2. It then reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a` for each test case, and stores them in the `test_cases` list.

3. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases `t` and the `test_cases` list as input.

4. Inside the `func_1` function, it iterates over each test case in the `test_cases` list.

5. For each test case, it initializes a variable `current_year` to 0, which represents the current year.

6. It then iterates over the periodicities of the signs `a` for the current test case.

7. For each periodicity `ai`, it checks if the `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`. If it is, it sets the `next_year` to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, it sets the `next_year` to the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.

8. It then updates the `current_year` to the `next_year`.

9. After iterating over all the periodicities for the current test case, it appends the final `current_year` to the `results` list.

10. Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen for each test case.

11. The program then prints the results for each test case.

Based on the provided problem description and the given Python program, the program's logic correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
