The only variable in the loop head is variable  ai, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `ai` is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case. `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. If `next_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `next_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous value of `next_year`.**
