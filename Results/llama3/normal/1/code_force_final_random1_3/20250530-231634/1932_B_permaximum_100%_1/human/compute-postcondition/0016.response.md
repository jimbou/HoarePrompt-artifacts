Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year` otherwise, and `next_year` is now `current_year + ai`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values and properties, except for `next_year`, which is now updated to be `current_year + ai`. This means that `next_year` is no longer necessarily the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`, but rather a specific value that is `ai` more than `current_year`.
