Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.***
