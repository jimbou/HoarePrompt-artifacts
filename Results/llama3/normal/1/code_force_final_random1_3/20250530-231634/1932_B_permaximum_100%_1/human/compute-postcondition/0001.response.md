To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `test` and the list `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least 1 test case, the loop will execute. Since `t` is a positive integer and `results` is an empty list, these states do not affect the execution of the loop.

So, for the loop to be executed, the `test_cases` list must have at least 1 test case, and the `test` variable is now the first test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list**
