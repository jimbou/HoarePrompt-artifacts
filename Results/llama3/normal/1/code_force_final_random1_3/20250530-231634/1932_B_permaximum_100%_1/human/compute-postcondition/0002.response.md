Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, test is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case, a is the second element of the first test case, current_year is 0**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `test` is also unchanged as it is not reassigned. The code extracts the first two elements of the first test case in `test_cases` and assigns them to `n` and `a`, respectively. The variable `current_year` is initialized to 0.
