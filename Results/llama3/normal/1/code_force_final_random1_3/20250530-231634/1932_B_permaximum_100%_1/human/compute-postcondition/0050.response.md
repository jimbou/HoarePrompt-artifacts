Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, `current_year` is not divisible by `ai`**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. This is because the expression `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` calculates the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
