Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case. `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `next_year` has been updated to be the sum of the previous value of `current_year` and `ai`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `results` still contains the values of `next_year` and `current_year`, but `next_year` has been updated. The rest of the variables maintain their initial conditions.
