Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it iterates through the periodicities of the signs. It calculates the next year in which each sign will occur, taking into account whether the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity. The program then appends the final year calculated for each test case to the results list.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the line where it calculates the next year, it checks if the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity. If it is, it sets the next year to be the current year plus the periodicity. If it is not, it sets the next year to be the smallest multiple of the periodicity that is greater than the current year. This logic is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the signs must occur sequentially. 

For example, if the current year is 10 and the sign's periodicity is 3, the program will set the next year to be 12, which is the smallest multiple of 3 that is greater than 10. However, this is incorrect because the sign that occurs every 3 years will not occur in year 12, it will occur in year 12 - 10 + 1 = 3.

Correctness: **False**
