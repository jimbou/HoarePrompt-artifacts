Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list that contains the value of `next_year` and `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list, `n` is the first element of the test case. `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. If `next_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `next_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the previous value of `next_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the conditions that were true in the initial state are still true in the output state.
