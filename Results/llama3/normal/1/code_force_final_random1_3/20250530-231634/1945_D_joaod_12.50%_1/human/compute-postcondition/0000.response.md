Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: two space-separated integers (n and m) and two lists of n space-separated integers (a_1 to a_n and b_1 to b_n). n and m are positive integers, 1 <= m <= n <= 200000. a_i and b_i are positive integers, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.**

The code reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases, and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The input still contains multiple test cases, each with three inputs: two space-separated integers (n and m) and two lists of n space-separated integers (a_1 to a_n and b_1 to b_n). The values of n, m, a_i, and b_i remain the same as in the initial state.
