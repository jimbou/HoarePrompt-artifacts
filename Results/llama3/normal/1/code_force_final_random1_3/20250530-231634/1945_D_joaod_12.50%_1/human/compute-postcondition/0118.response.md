Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the first element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`, which is a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, and if it is true, `best` will be updated to the new value of `total` plus the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
