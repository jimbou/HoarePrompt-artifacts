According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `cases` is greater than 0 and `c` is now 0.
State: **`cases` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: two space-separated integers (n and m) and two lists of n space-separated integers (a_1 to a_n and b_1 to b_n). n and m are positive integers, 1 <= m <= n <= 200000. a_i and b_i are positive integers, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9**
