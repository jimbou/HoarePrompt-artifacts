Output State: **cases is a positive integer greater than 2, c is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, na_frente is a positive integer, pos_final is a positive integer, 0 <= pos_final <= 199999, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n positive integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n positive integers, v is -1, total is the minimum sum of custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b from na_frente to 0, best is the minimum of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for all v from na_frente to pos_final.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `cases`, `c`, `stdin`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged. The variable `v` is set to -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `total` is updated to be the minimum sum of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` from `na_frente` to 0. The variable `best` is updated to be the minimum of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final`.
