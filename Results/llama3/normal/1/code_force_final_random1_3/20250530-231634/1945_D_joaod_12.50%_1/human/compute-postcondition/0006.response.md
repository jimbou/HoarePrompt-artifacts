Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `total` is 0, `best` is equal to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `best` is now less than or equal to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, as it was assigned this value.
