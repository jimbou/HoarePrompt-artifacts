Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente` - 1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been increased by the cost of changing at the position `na_frente - 1`, which is stored in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
