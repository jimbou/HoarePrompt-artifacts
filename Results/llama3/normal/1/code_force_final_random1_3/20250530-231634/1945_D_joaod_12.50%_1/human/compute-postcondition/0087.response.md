To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v`, `na_frente`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12**
