Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`. In both cases, `best` is either the original value or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]` if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`.***
