To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `c` and `cases`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `c` is less than `cases`. At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 1 and `cases` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between changing at each position and passing at each position from `na_frente` to 0, `best` is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change at each position from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is printed**
