Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is a positive integer greater than 0, c is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, na_frente is a positive integer, 0 <= na_frente <= 199999, pos_final is a positive integer, 0 <= pos_final <= 199999, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n positive integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n positive integers, total is 0, best is 10^12
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum cost between changing at index `v` and passing at index `v`, and `best` is updated if the sum of `total` and the cost to change at index `v` is less than the current `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the cost to change at index `na_frente` if changing at index `v` is less expensive, otherwise it is increased by the cost to pass at index `na_frente`, and `best` remains unchanged. In both cases, `v` is updated to be equal to `na_frente`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente` - 1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`, otherwise `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`. Additionally, if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`, otherwise `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente` - 2. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]` and `best` remains unchanged. If `v` is greater than `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` and if `best` is not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
