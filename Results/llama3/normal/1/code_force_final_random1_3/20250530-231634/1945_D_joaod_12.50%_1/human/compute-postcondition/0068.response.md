Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 1, the counter `c` is still 1, there are still multiple test cases in the standard input minus two, the value of `na_frente` is still a positive integer less than or equal to 199999 and one less than its original value, the value of `pos_final` is still a positive integer less than or equal to 199999 and one less than its original value, the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are still lists of n positive integers, `v` is still equal to `na_frente`, and the total cost is increased by the cost of changing the position at index `na_frente` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
