Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is increased by the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, `best` is 10^12, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the cost to change `a` at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass `b` at position `v`**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, which is `na_frente`. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `v` and `pos_final` is still maintained, and the cost to change `a` at position `v` is still greater than or equal to the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.
