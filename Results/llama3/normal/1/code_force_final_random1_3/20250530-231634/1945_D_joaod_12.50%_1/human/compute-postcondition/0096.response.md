Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`, then `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and the current value of `best` is updated to the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the current value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` is greater than or equal to the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`, then `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`, and the current value of `best` is updated to the sum of the updated `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the current value of `best` is greater than the sum of the updated `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.***
