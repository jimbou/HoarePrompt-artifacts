Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, the current value of `best` is equal to the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is still greater than 2, and the variable c remains 2. The standard input still contains multiple test cases minus two. The variables na_frente, pos_final, custo_pra_trocar_a, and custo_pra_passar_b retain their initial values. The variable v is still equal to na_frente, and the total remains 0. The current value of v is still less than or equal to pos_final. The variable best has been updated to be equal to the sum of total and the value at index v in custo_pra_trocar_a.
