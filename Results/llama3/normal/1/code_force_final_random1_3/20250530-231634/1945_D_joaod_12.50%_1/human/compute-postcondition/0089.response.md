Postcondition: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, the current value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.**
