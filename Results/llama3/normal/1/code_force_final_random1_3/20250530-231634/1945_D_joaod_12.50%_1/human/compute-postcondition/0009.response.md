Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `total` is the sum of its previous value and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If the current best value is greater than the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to be equal to this sum. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has been updated by adding the cost of changing at the current position `v` to the previous total cost. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the best value and the comparison between the costs of changing and passing at position `v` are still valid.
