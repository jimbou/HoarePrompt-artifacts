Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `total` is 0, `v` is `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If the current best value is greater than the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to be equal to this sum. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
