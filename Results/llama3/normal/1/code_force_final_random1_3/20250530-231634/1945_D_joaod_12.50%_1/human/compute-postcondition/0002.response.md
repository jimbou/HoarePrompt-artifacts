Output State: **cases is a positive integer greater than 0, c is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, na_frente is a positive integer, 0 <= na_frente <= 199999, pos_final is a positive integer, 0 <= pos_final <= 199999, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n positive integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n positive integers, total is 0, best is 10^12**

The code executes a single test case from the input. The first line reads two space-separated integers, `na_frente` and `pos_final`, from the input and assigns them to the corresponding variables. The second and third lines read two lists of `n` space-separated integers, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, from the input and assign them to the corresponding variables. The fourth and fifth lines decrement `na_frente` and `pos_final` by 1, respectively. The sixth and seventh lines initialize `total` to 0 and `best` to 10^12, respectively. The code does not modify the value of `cases` or `c`. The input is reduced by one test case.
