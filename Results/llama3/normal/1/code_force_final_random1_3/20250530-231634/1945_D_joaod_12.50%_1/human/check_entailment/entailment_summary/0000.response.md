Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people in the queue. 

The program iterates over the positions from n to 0, keeping track of the total cost and the best cost found so far. If the current position is within the desired range (i.e., v <= pos_final), it updates the best cost if the current cost plus the cost to change at the current position is less than the best cost found so far. It then adds the minimum cost to change or pass at the current position to the total cost. 

If the current position is not within the desired range, it simply adds the minimum cost to change or pass at the current position to the total cost. 

Finally, it prints the best cost found, which represents the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
