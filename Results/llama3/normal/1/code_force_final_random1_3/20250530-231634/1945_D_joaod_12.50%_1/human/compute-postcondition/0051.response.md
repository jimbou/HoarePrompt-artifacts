Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is the sum of the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at position `v` and the previous value of `total`, if the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`, then the best value is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at position `v` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at position `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has been updated by adding the cost to change at position `v`, which is the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at position `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The best value is still updated based on the comparison with the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`.
