Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente` - 2, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` depending on the conditions, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables keep their initial values except for `total` and `best`. `total` is increased by either the cost to change at position `na_frente - 2` or the cost to pass at position `na_frente - 2`, depending on the conditions. `best` is updated to be the current total plus the cost to change at position `na_frente - 2`.
