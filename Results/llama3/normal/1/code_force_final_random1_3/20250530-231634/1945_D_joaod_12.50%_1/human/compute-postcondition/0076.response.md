Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. If `best` is greater than `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` is increased by the first element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`, which is a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still dependent on the comparison between `best` and `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.
