Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is 0, if the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`, then the best value is updated to the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`. Additionally, the cost to change at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass at position `v`***
