Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is 10^12, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the cost to pass through position `v` in list `custo_pra_passar_b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
