Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` is greater than or equal to the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`. If the current value of `best` is greater than the sum of the updated `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then the current value of `best` is updated to the sum of the updated `total` and the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `total` has been updated by adding the value at index `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationship between `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, as well as the update of `best`, are still valid.
