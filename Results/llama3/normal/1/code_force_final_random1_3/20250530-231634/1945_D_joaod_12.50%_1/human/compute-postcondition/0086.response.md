Output State: **cases is a positive integer greater than 2, c is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, na_frente is a positive integer, pos_final is a positive integer, 0 <= pos_final <= 199999, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n positive integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n positive integers, v is -1, total is 0, best is 10^12**

The code executes and assigns the values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` from stdin, then assigns the values of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` from stdin. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by 1. The variable `total` is reset to 0, and `best` is set to 10^12. The values of `cases`, `c`, `v`, and the original values of `pos_final` and `na_frente` are not affected by the code.
