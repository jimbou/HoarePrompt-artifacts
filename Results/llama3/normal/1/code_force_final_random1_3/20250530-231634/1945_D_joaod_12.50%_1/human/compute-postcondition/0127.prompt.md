Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: two space-separated integers (n and m) and two lists of n space-separated integers (a_1 to a_n and b_1 to b_n). n and m are positive integers, 1 <= m <= n <= 200000. a_i and b_i are positive integers, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is -1. `total` is the sum of the minimum cost between changing at index `v` and passing at index `v` for all `v` from `na_frente` to 0. `best` is the minimum sum of `total` and the cost to change at index `v` for all `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final`, and best is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cases is a positive integer greater than 1, c is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, na_frente is -1, pos_final is a positive integer, 0 <= pos_final <= 199999, pos_final is one less than its original value, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n positive integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n positive integers, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum costs between changing at each position and passing at each position from na_frente to 0, best is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change at each position from na_frente to 0, and best is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cases is a positive integer greater than 2, c is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, na_frente is a positive integer, pos_final is a positive integer, 0 <= pos_final <= 199999, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n positive integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n positive integers, v is -1, total is the minimum sum of custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b from na_frente to 0, best is the minimum of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for all v from na_frente to pos_final, and the best (minimum of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for all v from na_frente to pos_final) is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
