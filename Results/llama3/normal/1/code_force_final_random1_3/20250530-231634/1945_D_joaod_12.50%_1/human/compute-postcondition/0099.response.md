Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is 10^12, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `v` is greater than `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` still holds true.
