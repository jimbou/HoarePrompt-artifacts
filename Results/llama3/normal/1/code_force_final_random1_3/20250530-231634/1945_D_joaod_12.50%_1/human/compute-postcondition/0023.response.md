Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente` - 1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been increased by the cost of changing at the current position `na_frente - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, but its value may have changed if `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the previous value of `best`.
