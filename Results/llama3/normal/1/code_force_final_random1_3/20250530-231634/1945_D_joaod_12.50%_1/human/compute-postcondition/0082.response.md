Output State: **cases is a positive integer greater than 1, c is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, na_frente is -1, pos_final is a positive integer, 0 <= pos_final <= 199999, pos_final is one less than its original value, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n positive integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n positive integers, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum costs between changing at each position and passing at each position from na_frente to 0, best is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change at each position from na_frente to 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated from `na_frente` to 0, updating `total` and `best` at each iteration. The value of `na_frente` is now -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `cases`, `c`, `stdin`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged. The value of `v` is also -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between changing at each position and passing at each position from `na_frente` to 0. The value of `best` is the minimum total cost plus the cost to change at each position from `na_frente` to 0.
