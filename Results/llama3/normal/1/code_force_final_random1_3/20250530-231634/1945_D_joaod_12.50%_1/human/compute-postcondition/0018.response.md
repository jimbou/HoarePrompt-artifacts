Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is increased by the cost to pass at position `na_frente`, `best` is 10^12, `v` is `na_frente` and `v` is larger than `pos_final`.***
