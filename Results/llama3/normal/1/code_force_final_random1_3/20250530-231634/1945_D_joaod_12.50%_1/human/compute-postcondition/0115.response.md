Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` is calculated by adding the value of `total` and the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, since `v` is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
