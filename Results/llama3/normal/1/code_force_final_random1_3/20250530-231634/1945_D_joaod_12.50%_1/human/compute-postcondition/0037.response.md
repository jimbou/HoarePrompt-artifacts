Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente` - 2, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `best` is either greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `best` is either greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` is increased by the cost of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2`. The value of `best` remains the same if it is greater than the new total plus the cost of changing to `a` at position `v`, otherwise it is updated to the new total plus the cost of changing to `a` at position `na_frente - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
