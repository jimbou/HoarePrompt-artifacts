Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been increased by the cost of passing through position `na_frente` in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition for updating `best` is still dependent on the comparison with `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`.
