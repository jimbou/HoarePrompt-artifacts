Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to a position among the first m people in line.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of people in the queue (n), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), and the two lists of integers (a_1 to a_n and b_1 to b_n).

2. It initializes the necessary variables, including the total cost (total) and the best cost (best), which is initially set to a large value (10^12).

3. The program then iterates over the queue from the end to the beginning (from na_frente to 0). For each position, it checks if the current position is within the allowable final position (pos_final). If it is, it updates the best cost if the current total cost plus the cost to change at the current position is less than the current best cost.

4. Regardless of whether the current position is within the allowable final position, the program updates the total cost by adding the minimum cost between changing at the current position and passing at the current position.

5. After iterating over the entire queue, the program prints the best cost, which represents the minimum total cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to a position among the first m people in line.

Correctness: **True**
