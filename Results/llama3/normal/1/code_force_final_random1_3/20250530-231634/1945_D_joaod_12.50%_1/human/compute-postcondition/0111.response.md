Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the second element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b` (since `v` is 1, which is used as an index to access the list). The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
