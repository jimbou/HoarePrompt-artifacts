Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is a positive integer greater than 1, c is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, na_frente is a positive integer, 0 <= na_frente <= 199999, na_frente is one less than its original value, pos_final is a positive integer, 0 <= pos_final <= 199999, pos_final is one less than its original value, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n positive integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n positive integers, v is -1, total is 0, best is 10^12
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers. If `na_frente` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated based on the minimum cost between changing at position `na_frente` and passing at position `na_frente`, and `best` is updated if the new total cost plus the cost to change at position `na_frente` is less than the current best value. If `na_frente` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated based on the minimum cost between changing `a` at position `na_frente` and passing `b` at position `na_frente`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `best` is updated to the updated `total` if it is greater than the current `best`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]` and `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if it is greater than the current `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
