Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`, `best` is either the original value or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]` if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has increased by the second element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `best` is either its original value or the new value of `total` plus the second element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, depending on which one is greater.
