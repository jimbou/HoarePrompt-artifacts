To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `c` and `cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 0, and `cases` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be incremented by 1, and `cases` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is -1. `total` is the sum of the minimum cost between changing at index `v` and passing at index `v` for all `v` from `na_frente` to 0. `best` is the minimum sum of `total` and the cost to change at index `v` for all `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final`, and best is printed**
