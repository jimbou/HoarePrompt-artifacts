Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `best` is updated to the updated `total` if it is greater than the current `best`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]` and `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if it is greater than the current `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.***
