Output: **cases is a positive integer greater than 2, c is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, na_frente is a positive integer, pos_final is a positive integer, 0 <= pos_final <= 199999, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of n positive integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of n positive integers, v is -1, total is the minimum sum of custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b from na_frente to 0, best is the minimum of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for all v from na_frente to pos_final, and the best (minimum of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for all v from na_frente to pos_final) is being printed**
