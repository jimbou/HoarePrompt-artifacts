This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) and two lists of n integers (a_1 to a_n and b_1 to b_n). It then calculates the minimum total cost to move from position n to position 0, considering the costs of changing at each position and passing at each position. The function prints the minimum total cost plus the cost to change at each position from n to 0 for each test case.
