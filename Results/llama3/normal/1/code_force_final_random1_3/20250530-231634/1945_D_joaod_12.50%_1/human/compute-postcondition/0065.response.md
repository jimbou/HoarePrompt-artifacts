Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases, the current test case, the input, the position in front, the final position, the cost to change A, the cost to pass B, and the current position remain the same. The total cost has been updated by adding the cost to change A at the current position in front.
