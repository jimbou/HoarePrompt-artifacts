Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is -1. `total` is the sum of the minimum cost between changing at index `v` and passing at index `v` for all `v` from `na_frente` to 0. `best` is the minimum sum of `total` and the cost to change at index `v` for all `v` from `na_frente` to `pos_final`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `total` has accumulated the minimum cost of either changing or passing at each index from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` has been updated to be the minimum sum of `total` and the cost to change at any index from `na_frente` down to `pos_final`. The other variables remain unchanged.
