To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `v` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` is 2 (since `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, and `v` is decremented by 1 in each iteration).

To execute the loop one more time, `v` must be decremented by 1, so `v` becomes 1.

The other variables in the loop head are `na_frente`, which is not changed in the loop body, and the `range` object, which is not a variable that can be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `v`.

State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 1**
