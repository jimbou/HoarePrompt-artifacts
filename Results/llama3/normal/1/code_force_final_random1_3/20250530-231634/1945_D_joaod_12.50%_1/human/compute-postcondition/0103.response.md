Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated based on the comparison of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated if the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is set to the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.***
