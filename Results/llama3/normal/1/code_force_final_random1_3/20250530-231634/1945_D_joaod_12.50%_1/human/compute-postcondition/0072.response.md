The only variable in the loop head is variable  v, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v`. If `v` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `v` must be 0.
State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers, `v` is 0**
