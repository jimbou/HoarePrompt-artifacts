Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum cost between changing at index `v` and passing at index `v`, and `best` is updated if the sum of `total` and the cost to change at index `v` is less than the current `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the cost to change at index `na_frente` if changing at index `v` is less expensive, otherwise it is increased by the cost to pass at index `na_frente`, and `best` remains unchanged. In both cases, `v` is updated to be equal to `na_frente`.***
