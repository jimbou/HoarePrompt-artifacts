Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `na_frente` is a positive integer, 0 <= `na_frente` <= 199999, `na_frente` is one less than its original value, `pos_final` is a positive integer, 0 <= `pos_final` <= 199999, `pos_final` is one less than its original value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of n positive integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of n positive integers. If `na_frente` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated based on the minimum cost between changing at position `na_frente` and passing at position `na_frente`, and `best` is updated if the new total cost plus the cost to change at position `na_frente` is less than the current best value. If `na_frente` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated based on the minimum cost between changing `a` at position `na_frente` and passing `b` at position `na_frente`.***
