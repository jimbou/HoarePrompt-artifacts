The code prints the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`. `ans` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, while `ans1` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, plus the number of times `z` is 1. `z` is 1 if the last element of `s` is equal to `h`.

Output: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `h` is unchanged, `j` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, plus the number of times `z` is 1, `z` is 1 if the last element of `s` is equal to `h`, stdin remains unchanged, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed**
