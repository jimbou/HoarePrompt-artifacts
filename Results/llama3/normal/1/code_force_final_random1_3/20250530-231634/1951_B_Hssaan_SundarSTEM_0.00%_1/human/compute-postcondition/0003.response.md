Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `i` is the second element of `s`**

The code increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` was -1, so after the increment, `j` becomes 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
