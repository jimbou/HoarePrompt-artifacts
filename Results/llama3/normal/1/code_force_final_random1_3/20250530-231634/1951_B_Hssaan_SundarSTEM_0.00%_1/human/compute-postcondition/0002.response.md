To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` has at least two elements (since we're iterating over `s[1:]`).

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `j` is -1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `i` is the second element of `s`**
