Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and k are integers, s is a list of integers, ans is 0, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is -1, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, and stdin is empty. If the kth element of the list `s` is less than the second element of the list `s`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, and stdin is empty. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is the fourth element of the list `s`, and stdin is empty. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is either 1 or 2. If `h` is not less than `i`, `ans` is either 2 or 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
