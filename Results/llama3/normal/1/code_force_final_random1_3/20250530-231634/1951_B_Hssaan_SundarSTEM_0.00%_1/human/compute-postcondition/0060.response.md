Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is the first element in `s[1:]`, `z` is 1, `_` is 1, `p` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least one test case with one less input, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s` plus 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
