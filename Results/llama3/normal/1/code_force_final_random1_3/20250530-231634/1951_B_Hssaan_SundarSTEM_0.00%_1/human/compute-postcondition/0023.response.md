Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, the current value of `i` is equal to the current value of `h`, `i` is the first element of `s`, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `_` is 0, `p` is the length of `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0. The first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`.**
