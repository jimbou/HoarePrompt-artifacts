Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If the kth element of `s` is less than the second element of `s`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with `ans` being 0. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.***
