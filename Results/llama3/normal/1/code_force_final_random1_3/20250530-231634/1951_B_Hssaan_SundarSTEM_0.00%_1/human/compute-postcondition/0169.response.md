The code prints the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`. 

`ans` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. 

`ans1` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, plus the number of times `z` is 1. 

`z` is 1 if the last element of `s` is equal to `h`. 

Output: **max(ans, ans1) (where ans is the number of times i is equal to h and the first element of s is not equal to h, and ans1 is the sum of the number of times i is equal to h and the first element of s is not equal to h, and the number of times z is 1, and z is 1 if the last element of s is equal to h)**
