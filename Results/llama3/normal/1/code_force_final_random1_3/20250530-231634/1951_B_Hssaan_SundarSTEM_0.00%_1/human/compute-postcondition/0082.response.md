Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i`, `z`, `_`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers. If the first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`, then `ans1` is 1 and the first and kth elements of `s` are swapped. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
