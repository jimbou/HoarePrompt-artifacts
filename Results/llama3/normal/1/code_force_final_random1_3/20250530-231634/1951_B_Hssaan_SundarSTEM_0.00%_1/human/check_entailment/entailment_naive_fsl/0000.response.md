Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 2
1000000000 1

The program will output:

1
2
0

However, the correct output should be:

1
2
1

The program does not handle the case when the cow's rating is the highest among all cows. In this case, the program should output 1, but it outputs 0.

The issue is in the line `if h < i: break`. This line breaks the loop as soon as it finds a cow with a higher rating, but it should continue the loop to find the maximum number of wins.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to continue the loop even if it finds a cow with a higher rating. One possible solution is to use a flag to indicate whether the cow has won any matches, and update the flag accordingly.
