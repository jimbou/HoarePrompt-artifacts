Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers. If the first element of `s` is equal to the kth element of `s`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged and `z` is 1. If the first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`, then `ans1` is 1, the first and kth elements of `s` are swapped and `z` is 1. If the first element `i` of `s` is greater than the kth element `h` of `s`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to `h`.***
