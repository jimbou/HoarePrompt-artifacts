Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `h` is unchanged, `j` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, plus the number of times `z` is 1, `z` is 1 if the last element of `s` is equal to `h`, stdin remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and `h` remain unchanged.
* The value of `ans` is increased by the number of times the current element `i` is equal to the kth element `h` of the original list `s`, and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`.
* The value of `j` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop.
* The value of `p` is equal to `j`.
* The value of `ans1` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, plus the number of times `z` is 1.
* The value of `z` is 1 if the last element of `s` is equal to `h`.
* The state of stdin remains unchanged.

Note that the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i` is greater than `h`, so the loop may not execute all iterations if this condition is met.
