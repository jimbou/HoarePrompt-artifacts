Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an integer, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is an integer, `p` is equal to `j`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element of the list `s`. The first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`. If the current value of the first element of the list `s` is greater than the current value of the kth element of the original list `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 1. Otherwise, `ans1` is 0.***
