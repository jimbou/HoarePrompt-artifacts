Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of `s` is less than the first element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if the kth element of `s` is greater than or equal to the first element in `s[1:]` but less than the second element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 3, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is the third element in `s[1:]`, `z` is 1, `_` is 1, `p` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least one test case with one less input, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s` plus 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is 0 if the kth element of `s` is less than the first element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the kth element of `s` is greater than or equal to the first element in `s[1:]` but less than the second element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 2. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is 1 if the kth element of `s` is less than the first element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if the kth element of `s` is greater than or equal to the first element in `s[1:]` but less than the second element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.
