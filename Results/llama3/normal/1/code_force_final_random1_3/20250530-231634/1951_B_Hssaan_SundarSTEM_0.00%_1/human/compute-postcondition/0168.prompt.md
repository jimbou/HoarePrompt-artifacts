Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first and kth elements swapped twice (resulting in the original list), ans is an integer, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is an integer, p is equal to j, ans1 is 0, z is 0, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `p`, `z` is 1, stdin remains unchanged. If the first element of the list `s` is equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then if the current value of the first element of the list `s` is greater than the current value of the kth element of the original list `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `p`, `z` is 1, `s` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by 1. In all cases, stdin remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `p`, `j` is 1, `s` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `s`, `ans` is increased by 1, `h` is unchanged, stdin remains unchanged. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
