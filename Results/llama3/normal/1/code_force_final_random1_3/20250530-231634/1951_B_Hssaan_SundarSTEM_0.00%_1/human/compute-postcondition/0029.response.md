Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, `i` is the first element of `s`, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `_` is 0, `p` is the length of `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The current value of `i` is still greater than the current value of `h`.
