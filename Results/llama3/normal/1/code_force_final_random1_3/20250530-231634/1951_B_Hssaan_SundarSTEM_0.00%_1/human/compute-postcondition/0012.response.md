Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least three elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is the third element of `s`, `ans` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether the kth element of `s` is less than the third element of `s` or not.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If the kth element of `s` is less than the third element of `s`, `ans` is now 1, otherwise it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
