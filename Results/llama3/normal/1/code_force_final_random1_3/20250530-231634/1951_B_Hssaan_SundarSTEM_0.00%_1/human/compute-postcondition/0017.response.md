Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least four elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `j` is increased by 2, `i` is the fourth element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement with `ans` being 1 if the kth element of `s` is less than the fourth element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is set to 2. If `h` is not less than `i`, `ans` is either 3 or 2 depending on whether the kth element of `s` is less than the fourth element of `s` or not.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If `h` is less than `i`, `ans` is now 1 if the kth element of `s` is less than the fourth element of `s`, and 2 otherwise. If `h` is not less than `i`, `ans` is now 3 if the kth element of `s` is less than the fourth element of `s`, and 2 otherwise. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
