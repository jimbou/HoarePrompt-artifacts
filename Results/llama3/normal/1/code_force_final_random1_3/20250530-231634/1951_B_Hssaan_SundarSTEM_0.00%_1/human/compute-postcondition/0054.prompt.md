Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first and kth elements swapped, ans is the number of elements in s[1:] that are less than or equal to the kth element of s, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs, j is the length of s minus 2, i is the last element of s, h is the kth element of s, _ is 0, p is the length of s minus 2, ans1 is 0, z is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, `i` is the first element of `s`, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `_` is 0, `p` is the length of `s` minus 2. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`, otherwise `ans1` is 0, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 1; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `h`, `_`, `p` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `i` is equal to `h`, then if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 2 and `z` is 1. Otherwise, `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `j`, `i` is the second element in `s`, `h`, `_`, `p` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `i` is equal to `h`, then if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 3. Otherwise, `ans1` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 3 if `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 2. If `z` is not 1, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 2 and `z` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is 3. If `z` is not 1, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 2 and `z` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
