Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `j`, `i` is the second element in `s`, `h`, `_`, `p` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `z` is 1, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 3 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is 3. If `z` is not 1, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 2 and `z` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
