Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `p`, `z` is 1, stdin remains unchanged. If the first element of the list `s` is equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the first element of the list `s` is not equal to the kth element of the original list `s`, then if the current value of the first element of the list `s` is greater than the current value of the kth element of the original list `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is 1.***
