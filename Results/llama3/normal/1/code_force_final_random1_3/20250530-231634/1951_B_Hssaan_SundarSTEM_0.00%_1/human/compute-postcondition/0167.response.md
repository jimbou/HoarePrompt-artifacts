Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `j` is 1, `s` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `s`, `ans` is increased by 1, `h` is unchanged, stdin remains unchanged. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
