To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. Since the loop iterates over the input from `stdin`, we need to ensure that there is at least one test case in the input.

State: **`stdin` contains at least one test case, `_` is 0**
