Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of `s` is less than the first element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `j` is 1, `i` is the second element in `s[1:]`, `z` is 1, `_` is 1, `p` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least one test case with one less input, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s` plus 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least one test case with one less input.
