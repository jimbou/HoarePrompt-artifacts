The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was initially -1, its new value is 0.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, and stdin is empty.**
