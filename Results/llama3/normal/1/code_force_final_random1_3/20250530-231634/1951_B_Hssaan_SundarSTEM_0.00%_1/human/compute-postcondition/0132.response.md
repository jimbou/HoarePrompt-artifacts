Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is the fourth element of the list `s`, and stdin is empty. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is either 1 or 2. If `h` is not less than `i`, `ans` is either 2 or 3.***
