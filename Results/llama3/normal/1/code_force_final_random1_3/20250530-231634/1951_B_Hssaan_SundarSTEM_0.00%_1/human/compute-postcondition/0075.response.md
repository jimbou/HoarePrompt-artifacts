Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of `s` is less than the first element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if the kth element of `s` is greater than or equal to the first element in `s[1:]` but less than the second element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the kth element of `s` is less than the third element in `s[1:]`. If the kth element of `s` is not less than the third element in `s[1:]`, then `ans` is 1 if the kth element of `s` is less than the first element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if the kth element of `s` is greater than or equal to the first element in `s[1:]` but less than the second element in `s[1:]`, otherwise `ans` is 3.**
