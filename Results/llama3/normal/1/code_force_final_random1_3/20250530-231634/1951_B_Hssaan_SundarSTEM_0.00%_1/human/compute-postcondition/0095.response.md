Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i` is the next element in `s`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers, `z` is 1. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
