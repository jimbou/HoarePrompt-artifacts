Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `i` is the second element of `s`. The current value of `h` is less than the current value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the condition that the current value of `h` is less than the current value of `i` still holds.
