Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least three elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is the third element of `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement with `ans` being 0 if the kth element of `s` is less than the third element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is set to 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is increased by 1. The value of `ans` is determined by the comparison between the kth element of `s` and the third element of `s`. If the kth element is less than the third element, `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.
