Output State: **`n`, `k`, `j`, `i` is the second element in `s`, `h`, `_`, `p` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `i` is equal to `h`, then if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 2 and `z` is 1. Otherwise, `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of the values of `i` and `h`. The values of the variables remain the same, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
