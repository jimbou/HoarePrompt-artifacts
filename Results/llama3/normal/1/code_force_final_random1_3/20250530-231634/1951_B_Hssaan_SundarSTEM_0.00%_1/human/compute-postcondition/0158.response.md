Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `p`, `z` is 1, `s` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by 1. In all cases, stdin remains unchanged.***
