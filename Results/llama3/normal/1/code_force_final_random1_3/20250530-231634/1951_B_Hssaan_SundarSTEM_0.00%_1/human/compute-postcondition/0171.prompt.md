Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `k`, `j`, `i` is the last element in `s`, `h`, `_`, `p` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs. `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s` plus 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`. `z` is 1, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i`, `p`, `stdin`, `z` are integers or lists of integers, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s` plus the number of times the first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `h` is unchanged, `j` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is increased by the number of times `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, plus the number of times `z` is 1, `z` is 1 if the last element of `s` is equal to `h`, stdin remains unchanged, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
