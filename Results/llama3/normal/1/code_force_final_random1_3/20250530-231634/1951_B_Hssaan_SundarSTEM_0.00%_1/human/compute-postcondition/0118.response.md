Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, and stdin is empty. The current value of `h` is less than the current value of `i`.**
