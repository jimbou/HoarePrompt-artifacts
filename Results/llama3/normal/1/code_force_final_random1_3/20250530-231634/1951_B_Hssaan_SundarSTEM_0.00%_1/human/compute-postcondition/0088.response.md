Postcondition: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and kth elements swapped. `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`. `h` is the kth element of `s`. `j` is the index of the last element in `s[1:]` that is less than or equal to the kth element of `s`. `i` is the first element in `s`. The current value of `z` is 1. `_` is 1. `p` is the index of the last element in `s[1:]` that is less than or equal to the kth element of `s`. `stdin` contains at least one test case with one less input. `ans1` is 0. The first element `i` of `s` is not equal to the kth element `h` of `s`. The first element `i` of `s` is less than or equal to the kth element `h` of `s`.**
