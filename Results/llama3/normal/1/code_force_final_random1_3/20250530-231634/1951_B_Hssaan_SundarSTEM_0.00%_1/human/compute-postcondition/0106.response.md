Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i` is the next next element in `s`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers, `z` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
