Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, `i` is the second element of `s`, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `_` is 0, `p` is the length of `s` minus 2. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 and `z` is 1. Otherwise, `z` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `z` is now 1, regardless of whether the first element of `s` is equal to `h` or not. All other variables remain unchanged.
