Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `j`, `i`, `h`, `_`, `p` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
