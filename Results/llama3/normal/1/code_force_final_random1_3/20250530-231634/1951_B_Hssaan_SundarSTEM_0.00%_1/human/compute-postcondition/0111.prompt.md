Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, ans is the number of elements in s[1:] that are less than or equal to the kth element of s, h is the kth element of s, j is the index of the last element in s[1:] that is less than or equal to the kth element of s, i is the last element in s[1:], z is 0, _ is 1, p is the index of the last element in s[1:] that is less than or equal to the kth element of s, stdin contains at least one test case with one less input, ans1 is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers. If the first element of `s` is equal to the kth element of `s`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged and `z` is 1. If the first element of `s` is not equal to the kth element of `s`, then `ans1` is 1, the first and kth elements of `s` are swapped and `z` is 1. If the first element `i` of `s` is greater than the kth element `h` of `s`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i` is the next element in `s`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers, `z` is 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are increased by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i` is the next next element in `s`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers, `z` is 1. If the first element of `s` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `i` is greater than `h`, otherwise `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
