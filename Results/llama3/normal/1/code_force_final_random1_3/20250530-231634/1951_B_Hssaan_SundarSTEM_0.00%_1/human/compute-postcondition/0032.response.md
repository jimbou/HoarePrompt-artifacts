Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, `i` is the first element of `s`, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `_` is 0, `p` is the length of `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1, `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is less than or equal to `h`**

The code increments the value of `ans1` by 1. The initial value of `ans1` was 0, so after the code is executed, `ans1` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
