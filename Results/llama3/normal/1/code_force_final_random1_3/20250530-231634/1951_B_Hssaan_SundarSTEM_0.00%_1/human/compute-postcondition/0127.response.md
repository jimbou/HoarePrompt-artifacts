Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, and stdin is empty. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.***
