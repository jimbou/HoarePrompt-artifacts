Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i` is the next element in `s`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers, `z` is 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans`, `h`, `j`, `i`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1` are increased by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
