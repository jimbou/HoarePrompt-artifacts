Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, and stdin is empty. If the kth element of the list `s` is less than the second element of the list `s`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. ***
