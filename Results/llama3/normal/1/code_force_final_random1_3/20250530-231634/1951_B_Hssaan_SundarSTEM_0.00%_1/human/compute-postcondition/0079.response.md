Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `h` is the kth element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s[1:]` that is less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `i` is the first element in `s`, `z` is 0, `_` is 1, `p` is the index of the last element in `s[1:]` that is less than or equal to the kth element of `s`, `stdin` contains at least one test case with one less input, `ans1` is 0. The current value of `i` is equal to the current value of `h`.***
