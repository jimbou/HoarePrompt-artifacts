Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least len(lis) elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, j is len(lis)-1. If test is True, then if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1, 'Bob' is printed if j is odd, otherwise 'Alice' is printed. If the length of lis is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If the length of lis is even, 'Bob' is printed. If test is False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
