Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If 1 is not in lis or lis contains only one element, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if test is True, then if the difference between the last and second last elements of lis is greater than 1, 'Bob' is printed if the index of the last element is odd, otherwise 'Alice' is printed. If the length of lis is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If the length of lis is even, 'Bob' is printed. If test is False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
