Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the difference between the second and first elements of lis is greater than 1, then test is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
