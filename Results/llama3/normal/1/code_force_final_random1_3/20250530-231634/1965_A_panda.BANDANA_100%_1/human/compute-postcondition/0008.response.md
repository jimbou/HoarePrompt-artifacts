The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and lis, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lis.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers. The list lis contains 1 and has more than one element, stdin contains t-2 test cases, test is True. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 elements and the j is 1.
State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, test is True, j is 1**
