Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the second input, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be equal to the first input from stdin. The list `lis` is updated to be a sorted list of unique integers from the second input from stdin. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2, as two inputs are consumed by the code.
