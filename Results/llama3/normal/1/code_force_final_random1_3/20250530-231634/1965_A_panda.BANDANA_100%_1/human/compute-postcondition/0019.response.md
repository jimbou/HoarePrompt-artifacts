To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it accordingly.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, len(lis)):`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is initialized to 1 and will iterate over the indices of the list `lis` starting from 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `t` is at least 1
* `i` is 0
* `n` is an integer
* `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements
* `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases
* If the difference between the second and first elements of `lis` is greater than 1, then `test` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2.
* The length of `lis` is at least 2, so the loop will execute again if `j` is less than the length of `lis`.
* The state of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `stdin` remains unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head.
* The state of `lis` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop head.
* The state of `test` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `j` is 2**
