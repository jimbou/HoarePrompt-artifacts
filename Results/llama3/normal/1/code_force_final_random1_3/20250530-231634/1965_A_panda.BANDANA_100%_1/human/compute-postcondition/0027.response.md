To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `lis`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than the length of `lis`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `lis` has at least 3 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3. Additionally, since `lis` has at least 3 elements, it must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `j` is 3, `test` is False**
