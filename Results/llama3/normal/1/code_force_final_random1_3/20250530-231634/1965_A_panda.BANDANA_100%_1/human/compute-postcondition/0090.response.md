Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the second input, stdin contains t-6 test cases.**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer equal to the first input, its value remains unchanged. The second line assigns a map object containing the integers from the second input to `l`. The third line assigns a sorted list of unique integers from `l` to `lis`. Since `lis` was already a sorted list of unique integers from the second input, its value remains unchanged.

The value of `t` is not affected by the code, so it remains at least 3. The value of `i` is also not affected, so it remains 2. The value of `stdin` is reduced by 2 test cases, since two inputs are consumed by the code, so it now contains `t-6` test cases.

Note that the code does not modify the values of `t`, `i`, or `stdin` directly, but the values of `n` and `lis` are updated based on the input values.
