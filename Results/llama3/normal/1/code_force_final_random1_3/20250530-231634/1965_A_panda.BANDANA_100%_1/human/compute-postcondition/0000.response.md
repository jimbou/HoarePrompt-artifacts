Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The values of `n` and `a_i` are still within their respective ranges.
