Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on a sequence of integers. It reads a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a sequence of unique integers. If the sequence starts with 1 and all consecutive integers are adjacent (i.e., their difference is 1), the winner is determined by the length of the sequence: if it's odd, Alice wins; if it's even, Bob wins. If the sequence does not start with 1 or has non-adjacent integers, the winner is determined by the index of the first non-adjacent integer: if it's odd, Bob wins; if it's even, Alice wins. The function prints the winner for each test case.**
