To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `lis`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than the length of `lis`. Since `j` is currently 1, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 2.
2. The length of `lis` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it has at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again. Since `lis` already has at least 2 elements, we can conclude that it must have at least 3 elements.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `stdin`, and the printed output ('Bob' or 'Alice') are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2**
