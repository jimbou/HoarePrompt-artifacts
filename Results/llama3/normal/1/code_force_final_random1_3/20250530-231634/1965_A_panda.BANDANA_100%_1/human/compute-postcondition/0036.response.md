Postcondition: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least len(lis) elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, j is len(lis)-1, the current value of test is True. If lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1, then 'Bob' is printed if j is odd, otherwise 'Alice' is printed.**
