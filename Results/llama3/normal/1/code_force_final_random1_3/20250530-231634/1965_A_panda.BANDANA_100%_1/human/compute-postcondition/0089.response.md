The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the second input, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the index `j` of the first pair of elements in `lis` with a difference greater than 1 is odd or even respectively. If `test` is True, then if the length of `lis` is odd, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**
