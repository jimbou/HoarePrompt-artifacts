Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If 1 is not in lis or lis contains only one element, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if test is True, then if the difference between the last and second last elements of lis is greater than 1, 'Bob' is printed if the index of the last element is odd, otherwise 'Alice' is printed. If the length of lis is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If the length of lis is even, 'Bob' is printed. If test is False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the second input, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If 1 is not in lis or lis has only one element, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the index j of the first pair of elements in lis with a difference greater than 1 is odd or even respectively. If test is True, then if the length of lis is odd, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the second input, stdin contains t-6 test cases. If 1 is not in lis or lis has only one element, 'Alice' is printed. If lis has at least two elements, if the difference between any two consecutive elements of lis is not greater than 1, then if the length of lis is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If the length of lis is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of lis is greater than 1, then if the index of the larger element is odd, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
