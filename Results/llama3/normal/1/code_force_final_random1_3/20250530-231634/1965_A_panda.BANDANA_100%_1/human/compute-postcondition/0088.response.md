Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the second input, stdin contains t-4 test cases. If 1 is not in lis or lis has only one element, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the index j of the first pair of elements in lis with a difference greater than 1 is odd or even respectively. If test is True, then if the length of lis is odd, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.***
