To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for j in range(1, len(lis)):`. The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `lis`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lis`. If `j` is less than the length of `lis`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not explicitly stated, but since it's a loop variable, we can assume it's equal to the last value it took in the previous iteration. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(lis) - 1`, the last value of `j` would be `len(lis) - 1`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `len(lis)`. However, since the loop condition is `j < len(lis)`, `j` cannot be equal to `len(lis)`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again if `j` is equal to `len(lis)`.

The length of `lis` is not changed, so `lis` remains a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states are not adjusted.

The state of `test` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, but it's mentioned in the context. However, since it's not in the loop head, its state is not adjusted.

The state of `j` being odd or even is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, but it's mentioned in the context. However, since it's not in the loop head, its state is not adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `j` is `len(lis)`**
