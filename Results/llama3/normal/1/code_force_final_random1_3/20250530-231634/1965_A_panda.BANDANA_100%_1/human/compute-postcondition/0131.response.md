Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the second input, stdin contains t-6 test cases. If 1 is not in lis or lis has only one element, 'Alice' is printed. If lis has at least two elements, if the difference between any two consecutive elements of lis is not greater than 1, then if the length of lis is odd, 'Alice' is printed. If the length of lis is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of lis is greater than 1, then if the index of the larger element is odd, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.***
