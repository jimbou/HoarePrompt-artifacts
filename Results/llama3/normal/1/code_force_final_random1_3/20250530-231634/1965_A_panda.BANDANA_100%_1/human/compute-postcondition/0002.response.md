The code block reads an integer `n` from stdin, then reads a list of integers `l` from stdin, removes duplicates from `l` by converting it to a set, sorts the set, and assigns the result to `lis`. The value of `t` is not affected by the code, and `i` is not used in the code.

Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases**
