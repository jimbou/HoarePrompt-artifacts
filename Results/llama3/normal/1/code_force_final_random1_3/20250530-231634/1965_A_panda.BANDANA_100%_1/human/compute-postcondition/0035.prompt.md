Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers. The list lis contains 1 and has more than one element, stdin contains t-2 test cases, test is True
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the difference between the second and first elements of lis is greater than 1, then test is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, j is 2, test is False. If the difference between the third and second elements of lis is greater than 1, then if j is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. If j is even, 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, j is 3, test is False. If lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1, then 'Bob' is printed if j is odd, otherwise 'Alice' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
