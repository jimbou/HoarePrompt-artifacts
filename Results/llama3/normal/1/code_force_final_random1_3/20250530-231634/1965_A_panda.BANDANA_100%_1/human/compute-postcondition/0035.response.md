Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least len(lis) elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, j is len(lis)-1, test is False. If lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1, then 'Bob' is printed if j is odd, otherwise 'Alice' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to the last index of the list `lis`, and the value of `test` will be `False`. If the difference between the last two elements of `lis` is greater than 1, then either 'Bob' or 'Alice' will be printed, depending on whether the index `j` is odd or even. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
