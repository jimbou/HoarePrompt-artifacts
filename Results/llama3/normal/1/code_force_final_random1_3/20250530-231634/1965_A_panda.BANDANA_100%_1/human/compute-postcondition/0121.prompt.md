Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the second input, `test` is True, stdin contains t-6 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-6 test cases. If the difference between the second element of lis and the first element of lis is greater than 1, then test is False and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether j is odd or even respectively. Otherwise, test remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-6 test cases, j is len(lis). If the difference between the last and the second last element of lis is larger than 1, then if the length of lis is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed, test is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-6 test cases, j is 2, test is True if the difference between the second and the first element of lis is larger than 1, otherwise test is False. If the difference between the last and the second last element of lis is larger than 1, then if the length of lis is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed, and if j is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
