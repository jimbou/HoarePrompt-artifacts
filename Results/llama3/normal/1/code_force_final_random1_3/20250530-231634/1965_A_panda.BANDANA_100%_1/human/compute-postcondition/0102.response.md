Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `test` is True, stdin contains t-6 test cases. The difference between the second element of `lis` and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1. If `j` is an odd number, 'Bob' is printed. If `j` is an even number, 'Alice' is printed.***
