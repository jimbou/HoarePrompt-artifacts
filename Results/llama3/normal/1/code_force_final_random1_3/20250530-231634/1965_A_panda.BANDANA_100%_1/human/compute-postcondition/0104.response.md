Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-6 test cases. If the difference between the second element of lis and the first element of lis is greater than 1, then test is False and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether j is odd or even respectively. Otherwise, test remains True.***
