The first line sets the value of `test` to `False`. The second line is a `break` statement, but since it is not inside a loop, it does not affect the state of the program.

Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, test is False, stdin contains t-6 test cases. The difference between the second element of lis and the first element of lis is greater than 1. If j is an odd number, 'Bob' is printed. If j is an even number, 'Alice' is printed.**
