Postcondition: **t is at least 3, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-6 test cases, j is 2, test is True if the difference between the second and the first element of lis is larger than 1, otherwise test is False. If the difference between the last and the second last element of lis is larger than 1, then if the length of lis is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed, and if j is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed.**
