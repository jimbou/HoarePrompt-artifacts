Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-2 test cases, j is 2, test is False. If the difference between the third and second elements of lis is greater than 1, then if j is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. If j is even, 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
