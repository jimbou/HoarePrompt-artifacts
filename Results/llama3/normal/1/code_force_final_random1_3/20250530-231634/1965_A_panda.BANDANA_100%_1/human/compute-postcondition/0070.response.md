The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and lis, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lis.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, lis has at least 3 elements, j is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the j is 3.
State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 4 elements, j is 3**
