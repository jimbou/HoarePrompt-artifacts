To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `lis`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `lis` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `test` is True, and stdin contains t-4 test cases. However, these states do not affect the execution of the loop.

So, for the loop to be executed, `lis` must have at least 2 elements and `j` is 1.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `j` is 1**
