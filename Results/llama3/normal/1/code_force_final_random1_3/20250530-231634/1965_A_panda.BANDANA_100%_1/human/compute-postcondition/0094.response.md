To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `lis`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lis`. If `lis` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Since `j` starts from 1, we can adjust the state of `j` to be 1. The state of `lis` needs to be adjusted to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `test` is True, stdin contains t-6 test cases, `j` is 1**
