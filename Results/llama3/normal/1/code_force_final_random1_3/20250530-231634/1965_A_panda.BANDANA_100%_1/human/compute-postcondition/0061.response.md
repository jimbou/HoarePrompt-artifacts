Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements. If the difference between the current element of lis at index j and the previous element at index j-1 is greater than 1, then test is False, stdin contains t-4 test cases, and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether j is odd or even respectively. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
