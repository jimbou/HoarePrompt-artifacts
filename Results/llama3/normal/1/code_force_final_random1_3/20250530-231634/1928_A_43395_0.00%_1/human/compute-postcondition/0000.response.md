The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input(). If the input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and i is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), input() is at least 1, i is 0**
