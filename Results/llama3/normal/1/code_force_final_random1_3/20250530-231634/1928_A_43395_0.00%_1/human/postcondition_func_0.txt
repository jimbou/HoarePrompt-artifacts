This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, determines whether the difference between each pair meets certain conditions, and prints 'yes' or 'no' accordingly. The function iterates over the input pairs, checking if both numbers are even, if one is the negative of the other, or if their difference is odd, and prints 'yes' in the first and third cases, and 'no' in the second case. The function continues until all input pairs have been processed, leaving the standard input empty.
