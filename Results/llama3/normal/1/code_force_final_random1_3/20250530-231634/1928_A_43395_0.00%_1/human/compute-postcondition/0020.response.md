Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), input() is at least 0.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two integers read from the first line of the stdin, which contains t-2 lines. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b. The input() function is still at least 0, indicating that there are still inputs available to be read.
