Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking the parity of the sides of the rectangle and the difference between them. However, the conditions in the program do not accurately reflect the problem statement.

The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even, and if so, prints 'yes'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that another rectangle can be formed. For example, if `a` and `b` are both even, but `a` is not equal to `b`, then it is not possible to form another rectangle.

The program also checks if `a` is equal to `-b` or `b` is equal to `-a`, and if so, prints 'no'. However, this condition is not relevant to the problem, as the problem statement does not mention anything about negative numbers.

The program also checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, and if so, prints 'yes'. However, this is not a necessary condition to guarantee that another rectangle can be formed. For example, if `a` and `b` are both odd, but their difference is even, then it is still possible to form another rectangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct solution would require a more careful analysis of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
