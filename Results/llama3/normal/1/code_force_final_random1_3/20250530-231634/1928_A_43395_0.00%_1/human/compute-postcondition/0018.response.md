Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), input() is at least 0. If both `a` and `b` are even numbers, 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` or both are odd, then if `a` is equal to `-b` or `b` is equal to `-a`, 'no' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
