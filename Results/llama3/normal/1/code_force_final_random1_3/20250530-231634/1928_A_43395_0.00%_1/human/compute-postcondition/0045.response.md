Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is t-1, stdin is empty, input() is at least 0. If both `a` and `b` are even numbers, 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` or both are odd, then if `a` is equal to `-b` or `b` is equal to `-a`, 'no' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the values of `a` and `b` are still integers between 1 and 10^9. The value of `i` has reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The stdin is empty, meaning that all the input lines have been processed. The input() function is still at least 0, indicating that it has not been affected by the loop. The conditions for printing 'yes' or 'no' remain the same as in the previous output states.
