Output: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), input() is at least 0. Either `a` is odd or `b` is odd or both `a` and `b` are odd. Additionally, the following conditions are not met: `a - b` is not equal to `-a` and `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b - a` is not equal to `-b` and `b` is not equal to `a`. The difference between `a` and `b` is even, and 'no' is printed**
