Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), input() is at least 0. If either `a` is equal to the negation of `b` or `b` is equal to the negation of `a`, 'no' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed; otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
