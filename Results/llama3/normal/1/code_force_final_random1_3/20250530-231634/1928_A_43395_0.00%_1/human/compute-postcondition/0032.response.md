The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `input()`. If `i` is less than `input()`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `input()` is at least 0 and stdin contains t-3 lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is 2 and stdin contains t-2 lines.
State: **`a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), input() is at least 1**
