Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), input() is at least 0**.

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two integers read from the input, which are between 1 and 10^9. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b, since one line has been read. The input() function has been called at least once, so its count is at least 0.
