To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by the input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`. The input is at least 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented, and the input needs to be consumed. Since `i` is 0, incrementing it will make it 1. The input needs to be consumed by reading one line from `stdin`, which will leave `t-2` lines remaining.

The state of `a` and `b` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust their states.

The state of `input()` is at least 0, which means there is still input available to be read. After consuming one line, the input will still be at least 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), input() is at least 0.**
