Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), input() is at least 0. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is equal to the value of `a` or `b`, 'no' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed; otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
