Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program will print 'no', but the correct answer should be 'no' because a 3x3 rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when both a and b are odd. In this case, the program will print 'yes' if (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly handle the case when both a and b are odd. One possible solution is to check if the greatest common divisor of a and b is greater than 1. If it is, then another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, another rectangle cannot be formed.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly handle this case:

```
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif gcd(a, b) > 1:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

This modified program correctly handles the case when both a and b are odd and prints the correct answer for all potential cases.
