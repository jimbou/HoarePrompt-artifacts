You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is t-1, stdin is empty, input() is at least 0. If both `a` and `b` are even numbers, 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` or both are odd, then if `a` is equal to `-b` or `b` is equal to `-a`, 'no' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is t-1, stdin is empty, input() is at least 0. If both `a` and `b` are even numbers, 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` or both are odd, then if `a` is equal to `-b` or `b` is equal to `-a`, 'no' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
