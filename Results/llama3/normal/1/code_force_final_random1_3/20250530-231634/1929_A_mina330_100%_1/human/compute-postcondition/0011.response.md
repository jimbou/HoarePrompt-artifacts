The code prints the difference between the last and the first element of the list `a`.
Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, the last element of the list `a` is the largest number in the list, and the first element of the list `a` is the smallest number in the list.
Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list a**
