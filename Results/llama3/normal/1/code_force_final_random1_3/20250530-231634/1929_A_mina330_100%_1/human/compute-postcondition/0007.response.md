Based on the initial state, the code will print the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `a`.

Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, the first element `a[0]` will be the smallest integer in the list, and the last element `a[len(a) - 1]` will be the largest integer in the list.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list a**
