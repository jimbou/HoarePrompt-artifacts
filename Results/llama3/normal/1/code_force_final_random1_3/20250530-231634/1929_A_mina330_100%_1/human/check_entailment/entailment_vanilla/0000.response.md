Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem by first sorting the array in ascending order. Then, it calculates the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted array and prints this value as the maximum beauty.

However, this approach is incorrect. The beauty of the array is not just the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. It is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, consider the array [1, 3, 2]. The program would sort it as [1, 2, 3] and calculate the beauty as 3 - 1 = 2. However, the correct beauty is (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Correctness: **False**
