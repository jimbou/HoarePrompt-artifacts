Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order, so that the largest element is subtracted from the smallest element, resulting in the maximum possible difference.

The given program correctly implements this approach. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort()` method and prints the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
