Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, the elements should be arranged in ascending order, so that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The provided program sorts the input array in ascending order and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This is equivalent to calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is the maximum beauty that can be obtained.

However, the program does not actually calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Instead, it only prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the correct solution to the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
