Output State: **ntest is an integer between 3 and 100, itest is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, n is an integer between 2 and 100, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, and the difference between the last and the first element of the list a is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `ntest` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `itest` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The `stdin` now contains multiple test cases minus four because two lines of input have been consumed by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 100, which is the same range as before, but its actual value has been updated based on the input. The list `a` is now a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, and the difference between the last and the first element of the list `a` is being printed.
