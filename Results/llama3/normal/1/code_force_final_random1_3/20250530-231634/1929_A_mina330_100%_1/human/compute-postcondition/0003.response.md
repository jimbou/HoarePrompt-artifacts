The code prints the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `a`.
Since `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, the first element `a[0]` is the smallest integer in the list, and the last element `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest integer in the list.
Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the sorted list a**
