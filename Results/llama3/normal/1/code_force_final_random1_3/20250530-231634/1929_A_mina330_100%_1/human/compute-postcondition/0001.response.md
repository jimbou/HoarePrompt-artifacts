The only variables in the loop head are variables `itest` and `ntest`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ntest`. If `ntest` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ntest` is an integer between 2 and 100, which ensures that the loop will execute, so `ntest` does not need to be adjusted. However, `itest` needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`ntest` is an integer between 2 and 100, `itest` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
