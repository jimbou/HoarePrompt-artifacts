Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, the elements should be arranged in ascending order, so that the differences are maximized.

The given program correctly implements this approach. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then sorts the array in ascending order and prints the difference between the last and first elements, which is the maximum beauty of the array.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
