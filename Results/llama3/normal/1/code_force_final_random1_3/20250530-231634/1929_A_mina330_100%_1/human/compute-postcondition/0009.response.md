The only variable in the loop head is variable  itest and ntest, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `itest` and `ntest`. If `itest` is less than `ntest`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 2, `ntest` is between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `itest` must be increased by 1 and `ntest` must be greater than 3.
State: **`ntest` is an integer between 3 and 100, `itest` is 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, and the difference between the last and the first element of the list `a` is being printed**
