Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ntest` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ntest is an integer between 1 and 100, itest is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 2 and 100, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, and the difference between the last and first element of the list a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ntest is an integer between 1 and 100, itest is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, n is an integer between 2 and 100, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, and the difference between the last and the first element of the list a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ntest is an integer between 3 and 100, itest is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, n is an integer between 2 and 100, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, and the difference between the last and the first element of the list a is being printed which is a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
