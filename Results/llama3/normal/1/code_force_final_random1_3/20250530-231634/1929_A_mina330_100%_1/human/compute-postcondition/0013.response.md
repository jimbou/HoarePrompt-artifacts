Output State: **ntest is an integer between 0 and 100, itest is equal to ntest, stdin contains no test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 100, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, and the difference between the last and the first element of the list a is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all the test cases in the input, and there are no more test cases left to process. The loop has iterated `ntest` times, and the variable `itest` has reached the value of `ntest`. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, as all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `a` still hold the values of the last test case processed, and the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted list `a` is being printed as the output.
