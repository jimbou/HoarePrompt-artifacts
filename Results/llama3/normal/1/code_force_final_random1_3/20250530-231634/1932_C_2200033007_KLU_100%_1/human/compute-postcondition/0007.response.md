The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of `n` characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `b` contains the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. If the first character of `s` is 'R', `b` contains the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`, `i` is 1**
