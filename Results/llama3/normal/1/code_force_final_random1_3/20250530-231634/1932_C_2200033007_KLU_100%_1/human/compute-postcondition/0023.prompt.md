Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is -1, ans is an empty list, p is 1
Code of the loop:
for v in reversed(b):
    p = p * v % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers that must have at least 1 element, l is n, r is -1, ans is a list containing one element which is the value of p, p is the value of p * v % m, v is the last element in the list b

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, l is n, r is -1, ans is a list containing two elements: the original value of p and the new value of p which is the result of p * v % m, p is the result of p * v % m, v is the second-to-last element in the list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers that must have at least 1 element, l is n, r is -1, ans is a list containing three elements: the original value of p, the new value of p which is the result of p * v % m, and the new value of p which is the result of p * v % m, p is the result of p * v % m, v is the last element in the list b




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
