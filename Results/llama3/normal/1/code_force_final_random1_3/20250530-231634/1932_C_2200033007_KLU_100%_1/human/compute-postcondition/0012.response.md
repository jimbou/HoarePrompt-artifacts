Output State: **n is greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b contains the first or last element of a and two additional elements from a, l is increased by 1, r remains the same, i remains the same**

In this output state, the value of n remains greater than 2, and m remains a positive integer. The list a remains unchanged, containing n positive integers. The string s also remains unchanged, with n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. The list b now contains the first or last element of a and two additional elements from a. The variable l is increased by 1, while the variable r remains the same. The variable i remains unchanged, still equal to 2.
