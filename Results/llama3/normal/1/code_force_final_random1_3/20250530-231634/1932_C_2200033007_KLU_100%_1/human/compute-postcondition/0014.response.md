Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b contains the first or last element of a and two additional elements from a. If the current character s[i] is 'L', l is increased by 1 and r remains the same. If the current character s[i] is 'R', l is either 3 or 1 depending on the first character of s, and r is either n - 2 or n - 4 depending on the first character of s and the value of r before the code execution. In both cases, i remains the same.***
