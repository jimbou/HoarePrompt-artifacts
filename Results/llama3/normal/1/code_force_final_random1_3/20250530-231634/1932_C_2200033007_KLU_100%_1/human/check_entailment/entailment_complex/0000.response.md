Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by processing the commands in the string `s` and calculating the remainder of the product of the elements in the array `a` when divided by `m`.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly initializes the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` from the input.
2. The function `func_1` correctly rearranges the elements of `a` based on the commands in `s`. It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the left and right ends of the array, respectively.
3. The program correctly calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged elements modulo `m`. It uses a variable `p` to accumulate the product and updates it by multiplying it with each element and taking the remainder modulo `m`.
4. The program correctly returns the results in reverse order using the `reversed` function.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
