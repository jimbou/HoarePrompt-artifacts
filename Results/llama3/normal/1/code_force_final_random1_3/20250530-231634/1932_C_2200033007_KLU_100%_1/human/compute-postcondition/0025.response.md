Functionality: **This function takes a list of positive integers, a string of 'L' and 'R' characters, and a positive integer as input. It rearranges the integers based on the string, with 'L' indicating the next integer should be taken from the left of the list and 'R' indicating it should be taken from the right. It then calculates the cumulative product of these rearranged integers modulo the given positive integer, and returns the results in reverse order.**
