    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list containing n elements: the original value of p and the new values of p which are the results of p * v % m, where p is the result of p * v % m, v is undefined, m is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers, a string of 'L' and 'R' characters, and a positive integer as input. It rearranges the integers based on the string, with 'L' indicating the next integer should be taken from the left of the list and 'R' indicating it should be taken from the right. It then calculates the cumulative product of these rearranged integers modulo the given positive integer, and returns the results in reverse order.
