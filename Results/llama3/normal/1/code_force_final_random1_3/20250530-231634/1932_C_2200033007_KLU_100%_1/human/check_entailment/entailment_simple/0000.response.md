Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the array, the value to take the remainder by, the elements of the array, and the string of commands.

The program then defines a function `func_1` that takes the length of the array, the value to take the remainder by, the elements of the array, and the string of commands as input. This function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of the array in the order they are removed, and two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array, respectively.

The function then iterates over the string of commands. If the command is 'L', it removes the leftmost element from the array and adds it to the list `b`, and increments the left pointer `l`. If the command is 'R', it removes the rightmost element from the array and adds it to the list `b`, and decrements the right pointer `r`.

After processing all commands, the function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders of the product of the elements of the array at each step, and a variable `p` to keep track of the product of the elements. It then iterates over the list `b` in reverse order, multiplying `p` by each element and taking the remainder by `m`, and appending the result to the list `ans`.

Finally, the function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which contains the remainders of the product of the elements of the array at each step.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls the function `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
