State: **n is greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. b contains the first or last element of a and an additional element from a. If the first character of s is 'L', l is 3, r is n - 1, and the additional element in b is the element at index 2 of a. If the first character of s is 'R', l is 1, r is n - 3, and the additional element in b is the element at index n - 3 of a. If the current character s[i] is 'L', l is increased by 1. If the current character s[i] is 'R', r is decreased by 1. i is 2.**
