Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of `n` characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `b` contains the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. If the first character of `s` is 'R', `b` contains the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`.***
