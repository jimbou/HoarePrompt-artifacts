Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by processing the commands in the order they are written in the string s. It uses two pointers, l and r, to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array a, respectively. It then appends the elements to the list b based on the commands in the string s. After that, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in the list b modulo m and appends the results to the list ans. Finally, it returns the list ans in reverse order.

The execution summary also correctly describes the behavior of the function func_1. It takes a list of positive integers, a string of 'L' and 'R' characters, and a positive integer as input, rearranges the integers based on the string, calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged integers modulo the given positive integer, and returns the results in reverse order.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
