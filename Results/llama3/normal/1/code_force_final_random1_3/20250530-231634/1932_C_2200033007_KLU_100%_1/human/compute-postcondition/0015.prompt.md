Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is an empty list, l is 0, r is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == 'L':
        b.append(a[l])
        l += 1
    else:
        b.append(a[r])
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of `n` characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. If the first character of `s` is 'L', `b` contains the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. If the first character of `s` is 'R', `b` contains the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 1, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. b contains the first or last element of a and an additional element from a. If the first character of s is 'L', l is 2, r is n - 1, and the additional element in b is the element at index 1 of a. If the first character of s is 'R', l is 1, r is n - 2, and the additional element in b is the element at index n - 2 of a. If the current character s[i] is 'L', l is increased by 1. If the current character s[i] is 'R', r is decreased by 1. i is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b contains the first or last element of a and two additional elements from a. If the current character s[i] is 'L', l is increased by 1 and r remains the same. If the current character s[i] is 'R', l is either 3 or 1 depending on the first character of s, and r is either n - 2 or n - 4 depending on the first character of s and the value of r before the code execution. In both cases, i remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
