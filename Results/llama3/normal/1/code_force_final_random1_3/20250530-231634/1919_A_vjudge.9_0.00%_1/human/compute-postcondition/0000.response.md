Output State: **t is an integer equal to the input value, a and b are positive integers, results is an empty list, stdin is empty**

In this code block, the first line prompts the user to enter the number of test cases and assigns the input value to `t`. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. 

Since `a` and `b` were initially positive integers and were not modified by the code, they remain positive integers. The value of `t` is now an integer equal to the input value, and `results` is an empty list. Stdin is empty because it has been used to input the value for `t`.
