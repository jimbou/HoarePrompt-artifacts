According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results. If the results has at least 1 result the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the results must have at least 1 result and the result is the first result in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `results` is a list containing the return values of func_1(a, b) for each iteration of the loop that must have at least 1 result, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the first result in the list**
