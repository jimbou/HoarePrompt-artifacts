Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The game's rules state that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the winner of the game based on the sum of these integers. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'. This function is correct because the game's outcome can be determined by the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

`func_2` is the main function that accepts a positive integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and calls `func_1` to determine the winner. The results are stored in a list and printed after all test cases have been processed.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the problem's constraints and the functions' behavior. The problem states that the input values `a` and `b` are non-negative integers between 1 and 10^9, which is within the range of valid inputs for the functions. The functions' behavior is consistent with the problem's rules, and the output matches the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
