Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, a and b are positive integers, results is a list containing the return value of func_1(a, b), stdin is empty**

The code block first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` were already positive integers, their values are updated to the new values read from stdin. The second line calls the function `func_1` with the new values of `a` and `b` and assigns the return value to `winner`. The third line appends the value of `winner` to the list `results`, which was initially empty. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin is empty after reading the two integers.
