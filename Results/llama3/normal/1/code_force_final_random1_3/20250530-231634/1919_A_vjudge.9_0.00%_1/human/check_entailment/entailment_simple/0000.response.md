Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of two steps: choosing to exchange wallets with the opponent or keeping the current wallet, and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, and that player loses.

The provided program uses a simple strategy to determine the winner. It checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, the program returns 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win the game. If the sum is odd, the program returns 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win the game.

This strategy is based on the observation that the game can be reduced to a simple parity game. When Alice makes a move, she can either swap wallets or keep her current wallet. If she swaps wallets, the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets changes. If she keeps her current wallet, the parity remains the same. Since Bob's moves are determined by Alice's moves, the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets will alternate between even and odd.

If the initial sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will win the game because he can always make a move that changes the parity to odd. If the initial sum is odd, Alice will win the game because she can always make a move that changes the parity to even.

Therefore, the provided program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
