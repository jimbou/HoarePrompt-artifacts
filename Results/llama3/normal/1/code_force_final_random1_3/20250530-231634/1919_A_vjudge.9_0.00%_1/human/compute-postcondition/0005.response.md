To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, which means its value is not used anywhere in the loop body.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `t` is an integer greater than 0
* `a` and `b` are positive integers
* `results` is a list containing two values: the original return value of `func_1(a, b)` and the new return value of `func_1(a, b)`
* `stdin` is empty

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop executes again. Since the loop head only involves the variable `t`, we can only adjust the state of `t`.

For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1, because the loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 1.

The states of `a`, `b`, `results`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, as they are not involved in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `results` is a list containing two values: the original return value of `func_1(a, b)` and the new return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `stdin` is empty**
