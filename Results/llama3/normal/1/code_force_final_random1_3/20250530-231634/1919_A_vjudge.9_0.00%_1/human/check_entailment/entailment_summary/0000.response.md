Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The problem statement does not explicitly state the winning condition, but based on the example outputs, it appears that the player who cannot make a valid move loses.

Function 1, `func_1(a, b)`, determines the winner of the game based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This function seems to be correct based on the problem description and example outputs.

Function 2, `func_2()`, reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. This function appears to be correct based on the problem description and example outputs.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The problem statement mentions that the game ends when one player cannot make a valid move, but the functions do not explicitly check for this condition. Instead, they rely on the fact that the sum of the coins in the wallets determines the winner. While this may be true for the given example outputs, it is not explicitly stated in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct, but there is a slight uncertainty due to the lack of explicit clarification on the winning condition.

Correctness: **True**
