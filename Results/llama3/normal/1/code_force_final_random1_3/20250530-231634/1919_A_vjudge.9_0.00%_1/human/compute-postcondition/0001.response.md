To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is an integer equal to the input value, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its state is not relevant to the loop's execution.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty**
