Output State: **t is an integer equal to 0, a and b are positive integers, results is a list containing the return values of func_1(a, b) for each iteration of the loop, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variables `a` and `b` will still be positive integers, but their values will be the last values they were assigned during the loop's execution. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop, and the `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all input has been consumed.
