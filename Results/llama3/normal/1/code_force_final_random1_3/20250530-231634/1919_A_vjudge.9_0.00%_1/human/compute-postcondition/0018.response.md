Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer t, and for each iteration of t, it accepts two positive integers a and b, processes them, and returns a result. The function repeats this process t times, storing each result in a list. After processing all iterations, the function prints each result in the list. The final state of the program is that all results have been printed, and the input buffer (stdin) is empty.**
