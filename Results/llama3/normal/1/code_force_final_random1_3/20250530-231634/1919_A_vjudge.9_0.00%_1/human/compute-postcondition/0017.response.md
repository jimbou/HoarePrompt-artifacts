Output State: **t is 0, a and b are positive integers, results is a list containing the return values of func_1(a, b) for each iteration of the loop, stdin is empty, and all results in the list have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, the list `results` still contains the return values of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration, the standard input `stdin` is still empty, and all the results in the list have been printed to the console.
