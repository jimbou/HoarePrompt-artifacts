Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins, and if it's odd, Alice wins. The program correctly implements this logic using the modulo operator (`%`). 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program handles all possible inputs correctly, and the logic is sound. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
