Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, a and b are positive integers, results is a list containing two values: the original return value of func_1(a, b) and the new return value of func_1(a, b), stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values obtained from the input, which are positive integers. The `results` list now contains two values: the original return value of `func_1(a, b)` and the new return value of `func_1(a, b)` after the updated values of `a` and `b` are passed to the function. The stdin is empty as it has been used to obtain the new values of `a` and `b`.
