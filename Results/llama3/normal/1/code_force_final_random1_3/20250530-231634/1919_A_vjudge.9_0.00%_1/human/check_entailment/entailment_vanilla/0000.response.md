Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The task is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a string indicating the winner of the game. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and the input values for each test case, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and prints the results.

To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze `func_1`. The function uses the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` to determine the winner. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', otherwise, it returns 'Alice'. This logic is based on the observation that the game can be won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity game. Since the players alternate turns, the player who starts with the higher number of coins (or the player who can make the first move) has an advantage. By swapping wallets, a player can change the parity of their coin count, but they cannot change the overall parity of the game. Therefore, the player who can make the last move is determined by the initial parity of the total number of coins.

Given this insight, `func_1` is correct. It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

`func_2` is also correct, as it reads the input values, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and prints the results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
