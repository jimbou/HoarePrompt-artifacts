To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state.

The loop head is `for result in results:`. This means we are iterating over the `results` list, and `result` takes on the value of each element in the list on each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `t` is 0
* `a` and `b` are positive integers
* `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop that must have at least 1 result
* `stdin` is empty
* `result` is the first result in the list, and the first result in the list which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` is being printed

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* `results` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.
* `result` should take on the value of the next element in the `results` list.

Since `results` has at least one result, and we want the loop to execute again, we can conclude that `results` must have at least two results. The next iteration will process the second result in the list.

The adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop that must have at least 2 results, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the second result in the list**
