Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, a and b are positive integers, results is a list containing three values: the original return value of func_1(a, b), the new return value of func_1(a, b), and the return value of func_1(a, b) after the code execution, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new positive integers input from stdin. The `results` list now contains three values: the original return value of `func_1(a, b)`, the new return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and the return value of `func_1(a, b)` after the code execution. The stdin is empty as all inputs have been consumed.
