The only variable in the loop head is variable  result, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 3 results the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 2 results, result is the second result in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 results and the result is the third result in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop that must have at least 3 results, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the third result in the list**
