To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `minn` and `used` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `minn` is in `used`. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is a value between 2 and n+2 (inclusive), and `used` contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, including the key `minn` with value True.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `minn` is still in the range of keys in `used`. Since `minn` is between 2 and n+2, and `used` contains keys from 0 to n, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than or equal to `minn`. However, we cannot directly adjust `n` because it is not the only variable in the loop head. We can adjust `minn` to be within the range of keys in `used`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`, `used` contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and `minn` is a value between 2 and n (inclusive)**
