Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0, `minn` is 1, `used` contains the key 0 with value True, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `minn` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still greater than 0, `i` still 0, `arr` still a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` still containing 0, `used` still containing the key 0 with value True, and `stdin` still containing multiple test cases - 1. Additionally, the current value of `arr[i]` is still greater than 0.
