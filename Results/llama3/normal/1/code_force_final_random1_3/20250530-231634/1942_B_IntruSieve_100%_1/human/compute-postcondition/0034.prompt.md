Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 2, i is 2, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n. If the first element of arr is greater than 0, then mex contains 0 and minn, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and minn is greater than or equal to n+1. If the first element of arr is not greater than 0, then mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn, and minn, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0.
Code of the loop:
while minn in used:
    minn += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, the first element of `arr` is not greater than 0, and `minn` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, the first element of `arr` is not greater than 0, `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` must be in `used` and `minn` is now equal to `minn` + 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, the first element of `arr` is not greater than 0, `minn` is increased by 2 and `minn` + 1 must be in `used`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
