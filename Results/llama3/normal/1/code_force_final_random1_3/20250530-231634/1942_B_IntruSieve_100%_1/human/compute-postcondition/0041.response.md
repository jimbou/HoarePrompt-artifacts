The code prints the first element in the `mex` list which is the smallest absolute difference between the elements of `arr` and `minn`, where `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0.
Output: ** `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is a list of absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 1 element, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and `itm` is the first element in `mex`, and the first element in `mex` which is the smallest absolute difference between the elements of `arr` and `minn` is printed**
