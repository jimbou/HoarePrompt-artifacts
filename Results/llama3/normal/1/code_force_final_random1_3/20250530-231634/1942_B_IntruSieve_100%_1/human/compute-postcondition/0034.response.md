Output State: **minn is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in used, and used remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `minn` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the `used` dictionary, and the `used` dictionary itself will remain unchanged. This is because the loop continues to increment `minn` as long as it is present in `used`, and stops when `minn` is no longer in `used`.
