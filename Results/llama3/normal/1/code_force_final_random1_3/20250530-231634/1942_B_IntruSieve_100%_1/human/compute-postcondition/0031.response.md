Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, the first element of `arr` is not greater than 0, `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` must be in `used` and `minn` is now equal to `minn` + 1**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been increased by 1, but its previous value was not specified. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `minn` must be in `used` is still valid.
