Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, and the elements of the array `a`.
2.  It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the calculated permutation and a variable `minn` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that has not been used.
3.  It iterates over the elements of the array `a`. If an element is positive, it appends the current value of `minn` to the `mex` list and marks `minn` as used. It then increments `minn` until it finds a non-negative integer that has not been used.
4.  If an element is non-positive, it calculates the absolute difference between the element and `minn`, appends this difference to the `mex` list, and marks the difference as used.
5.  Finally, it prints the calculated permutation.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of a dictionary to keep track of used values ensures that the program avoids duplicates in the permutation.

Correctness: **True**
