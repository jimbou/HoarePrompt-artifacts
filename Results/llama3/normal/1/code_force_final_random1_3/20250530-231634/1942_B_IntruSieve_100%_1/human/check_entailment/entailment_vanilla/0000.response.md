Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a`, where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the constructed permutation, a variable `minn` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that has not been used, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used integers.
4. It iterates over the array `a`. For each element `a_i`, it checks if `a_i` is positive. If it is, it appends the current value of `minn` to the `mex` list and marks `minn` as used. It then increments `minn` until it finds an unused integer.
5. If `a_i` is not positive, it calculates the value of `p_i` as `abs(a_i - minn)` and appends it to the `mex` list. It also marks `p_i` as used.
6. Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `mex`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1` is called without defining it. The function definition should be moved above the loop that calls it.

Correctness: **True**
