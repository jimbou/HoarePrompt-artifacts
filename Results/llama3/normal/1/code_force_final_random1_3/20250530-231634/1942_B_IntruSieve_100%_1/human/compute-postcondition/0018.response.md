To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `minn` and `used`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `minn` is in `used`. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is a value between 1 and n+1 (inclusive), and `used` contains all keys from 0 to n with value True.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `minn` is still within the range of values in `used`. Since `minn` is already between 1 and n+1, we don't need to adjust its range. However, we need to make sure that `used` still contains the key `minn` with value True.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `used` to ensure that it still contains the key `minn` with value True.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`, `used` contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, including the key `minn` with value True, and `minn` is a value between 1 and n+1 (inclusive)**
