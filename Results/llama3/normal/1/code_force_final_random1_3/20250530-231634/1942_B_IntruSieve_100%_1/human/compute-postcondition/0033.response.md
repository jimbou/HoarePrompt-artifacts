The value of `minn` is increased by 1. The value of `minn` is already increased by 1 and `minn` + 1 must be in `used`. Therefore, the new value of `minn` is 2 more than the previous value of `minn`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, the first element of `arr` is not greater than 0, `minn` is increased by 2 and `minn` + 1 must be in `used`**
