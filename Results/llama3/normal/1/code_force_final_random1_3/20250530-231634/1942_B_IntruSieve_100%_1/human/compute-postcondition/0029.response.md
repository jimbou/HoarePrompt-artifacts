Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, the first element of `arr` is not greater than 0, and `minn` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The first element of `arr` is still not greater than 0, and the range of integers in `arr` is still from -n to n.
