Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains 0 if the first element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and minn is greater than or equal to n+1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `minn` will be greater than or equal to `n+1`, indicating that all values from 0 to `n` have been used and the loop has terminated. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still greater than 1, `i` still 1, `arr` still a list of integers in the range -n to n, and `mex` still containing 0 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, or the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` otherwise. The `used` dictionary still contains all keys from 0 to `n` with value True.
