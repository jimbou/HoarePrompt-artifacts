The code prints the first element in the `mex` list, which is a list of absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn`. Since `mex` must have at least 1 element, we know that `itm` will be a valid element.

Output: **the first element in the mex list (which is an absolute difference between an element of arr and minn)**
