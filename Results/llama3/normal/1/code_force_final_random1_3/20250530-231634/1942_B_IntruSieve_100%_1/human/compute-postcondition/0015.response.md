Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains 0 if the first element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True if the first element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is greater than or equal to n+1 if the first element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise minn is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The list `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. 

The value of `mex` is updated based on the first element of `arr`. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, then `mex` contains 0. Otherwise, `mex` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`.

The dictionary `used` is also updated based on the first element of `arr`. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, then `used` contains all keys from 0 to `n` with value True. Otherwise, `used` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` as a key with a value of True.

The value of `minn` is updated based on the first element of `arr`. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, then `minn` is greater than or equal to `n+1`. Otherwise, `minn` is 0.
