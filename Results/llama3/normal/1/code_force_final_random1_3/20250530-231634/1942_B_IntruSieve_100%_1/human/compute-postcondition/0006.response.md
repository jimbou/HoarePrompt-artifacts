According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `minn` and `used`. If `minn` is in `used`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is 1 and `used` contains the key 0 with value True. `minn` being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `minn` is greater than 1. `used` containing the key 0 with value True does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `used` contains the key 1 with value True.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0, `minn` is greater than 1, `used` contains the key 1 with value True, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0**
