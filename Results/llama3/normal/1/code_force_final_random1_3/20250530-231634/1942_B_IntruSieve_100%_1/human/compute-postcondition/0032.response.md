The only variable in the loop head is variable `minn` and `used`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `minn` and `used`.  If `minn` is in `used`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` must be in `used` and `minn` is now equal to `minn` + 1. For the loop to be executed one more time `minn` + 1 must be in `used`. 
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, the first element of `arr` is not greater than 0, `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` + 1 must be in `used`**
