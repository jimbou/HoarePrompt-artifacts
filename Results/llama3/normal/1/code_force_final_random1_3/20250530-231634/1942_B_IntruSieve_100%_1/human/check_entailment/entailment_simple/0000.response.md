Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a`, where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the permutation.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
2. It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation, a variable `minn` to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not in the permutation, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the elements already used in the permutation.
3. It then iterates over the array `a`. If an element `a_i` is greater than 0, it means that the corresponding element in the permutation should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the permutation (i.e., `minn`). It appends `minn` to the `mex` list, marks it as used, and increments `minn` until it finds the next smallest non-negative integer not in the permutation.
4. If an element `a_i` is not greater than 0, it means that the corresponding element in the permutation should be the absolute difference between `a_i` and `minn`. It appends this value to the `mex` list and marks it as used.
5. Finally, it prints the constructed permutation.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of the `used` dictionary to keep track of the elements already used in the permutation ensures that the constructed permutation is valid.

Correctness: **True**
