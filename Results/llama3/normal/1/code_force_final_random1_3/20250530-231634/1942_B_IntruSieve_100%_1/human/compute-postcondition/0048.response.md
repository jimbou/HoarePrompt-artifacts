Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is an empty list, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and all elements in `mex` have been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all elements in the `mex` list have been printed, and the `mex` list is now empty. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` being greater than or equal to 0, `i` being equal to `n`, `arr` being a list of integers in the range -n to n, `used` containing the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, and `minn` being the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0.
