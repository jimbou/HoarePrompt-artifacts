Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program initializes an empty list `mex` to store the constructed permutation `p`.
2. It initializes a variable `minn` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the constructed permutation `p`.
3. It initializes an empty dictionary `used` to keep track of the elements that have been used in the constructed permutation `p`.
4. The program then iterates over the input array `arr`. For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is greater than 0. If it is, it means that the current element in the permutation `p` should be the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the constructed permutation `p` so far, which is `minn`. It appends `minn` to the `mex` list and marks it as used in the `used` dictionary. It then increments `minn` until it finds the next minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the constructed permutation `p`.
5. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, it means that the current element in the permutation `p` should be the absolute difference between `minn` and `arr[i]`. It appends this value to the `mex` list and marks it as used in the `used` dictionary.
6. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p` by iterating over the `mex` list.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the input array `a` contains negative numbers, and when the input array `a` contains multiple occurrences of the same number.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
