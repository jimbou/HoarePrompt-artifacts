Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains the absolute differences between the elements of arr and minn if the elements are not greater than 0, used contains the absolute differences between the elements of arr and minn as keys with value True, and minn is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in used if any element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise minn is 0.
Code of the loop:
for itm in mex:
    print(itm, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is a list of absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 1 element, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and `itm` is the first element in `mex`, and the first element in `mex` which is the smallest absolute difference between the elements of `arr` and `minn` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is a list of absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 2 elements, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and `itm` is the second element in `mex`, and this is printed: the second smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is a list of absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 3 elements, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and `itm` is the third element in `mex`, and the third element of `mex` which is `itm` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
