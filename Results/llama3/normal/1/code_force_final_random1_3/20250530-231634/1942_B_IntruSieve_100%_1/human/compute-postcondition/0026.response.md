The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n. If the first element of arr is greater than 0, then mex contains 0, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and minn is greater than or equal to n+1. If the first element of arr is not greater than 0, then mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, and another element which is the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0.**
