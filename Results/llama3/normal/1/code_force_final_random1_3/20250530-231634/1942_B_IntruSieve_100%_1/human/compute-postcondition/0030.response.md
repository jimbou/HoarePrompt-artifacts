According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `minn` and `used`. If `minn` is in `used`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is increased by 1, but we don't know if `minn` is in `used` or not. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `minn` must be in `used`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, the first element of `arr` is not greater than 0, and `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` must be in `used`**
