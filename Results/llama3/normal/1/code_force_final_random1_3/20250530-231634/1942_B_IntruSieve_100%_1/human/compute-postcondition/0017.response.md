The value of `minn` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `minn` was between 0 and n (inclusive), so the new value of `minn` is between 1 and n+1 (inclusive). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`, `used` contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and `minn` is a value between 1 and n+1 (inclusive)**
