To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itm` and `mex`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `mex` list. If `mex` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

Before the loop starts, we know that `mex` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` if the elements are not greater than 0. For the loop to execute, `mex` must have at least 1 element.

Additionally, since `itm` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the first element in `mex` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is a list of absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 1 element, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and `itm` is the first element in `mex`.**
