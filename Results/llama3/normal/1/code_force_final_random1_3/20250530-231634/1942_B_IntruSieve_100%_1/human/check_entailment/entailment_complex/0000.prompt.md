Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains integers in the range -n to n, where n is the length of the list.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains the absolute differences between the elements of arr and minn if the elements are not greater than 0, used contains the absolute differences between the elements of arr and minn as keys with value True, and minn is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in used if any element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise minn is 0.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is an empty list, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and all elements in `mex` have been printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: Nothing

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads a positive integer n and a list of integers of length n from stdin, where the integers are in the range -n to n. It then calculates the absolute differences between the elements of the list and a minimum value minn, and prints these differences. The function also keeps track of the used values in a dictionary. After processing the input, the function prints the calculated differences and an empty line. The final state of the program is that all input has been processed and the output has been printed.
