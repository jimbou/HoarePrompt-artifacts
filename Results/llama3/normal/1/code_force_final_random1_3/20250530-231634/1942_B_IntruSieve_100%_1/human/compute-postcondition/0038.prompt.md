Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        used[minn] = True
        while minn in used:
            minn += 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the first element of arr is greater than 0, then mex contains 0, minn is greater than or equal to n+1, and used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True. Otherwise, mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 1, i is 1, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n. If the first element of arr is greater than 0, then mex contains 0, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and minn is greater than or equal to n+1. If the first element of arr is not greater than 0, then mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, and another element which is the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 2, i is 2, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n. If the first element of arr is greater than 0, then mex contains 0 and the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn if arr[i] is not greater than 0, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and minn is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in used if arr[i] is greater than 0, otherwise minn is greater than or equal to n+1. If the first element of arr is not greater than 0, then mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn, and the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn if arr[i] is not greater than 0, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0 if arr[i] is not greater than 0, otherwise minn is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in used.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
