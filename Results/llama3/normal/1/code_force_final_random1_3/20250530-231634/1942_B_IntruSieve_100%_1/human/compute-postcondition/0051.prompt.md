You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains integers in the range -n to n, where n is the length of the list.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains the absolute differences between the elements of arr and minn if the elements are not greater than 0, used contains the absolute differences between the elements of arr and minn as keys with value True, and minn is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in used if any element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise minn is 0.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is an empty list, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and all elements in `mex` have been printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: Nothing

```

Return Postconditions: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is an empty list, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and all elements in `mex` have been printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
