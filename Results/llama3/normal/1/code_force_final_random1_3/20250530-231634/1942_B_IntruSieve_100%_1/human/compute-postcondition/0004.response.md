To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `while minn in used:`. This loop will execute as long as `minn` is a key in the dictionary `used`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n
- `mex` contains 0
- `minn` is 0
- `used` contains the key 0 with value True
- `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1
- The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0

The loop head involves `minn` and `used`. For the loop to execute the first time, `minn` must be a key in `used`. However, the state already specifies that `used` contains the key 0 with value True, and `minn` is 0. This means the condition for the loop to execute is already met with the given state.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0, `minn` is 0, `used` contains the key 0 with value True, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0**
