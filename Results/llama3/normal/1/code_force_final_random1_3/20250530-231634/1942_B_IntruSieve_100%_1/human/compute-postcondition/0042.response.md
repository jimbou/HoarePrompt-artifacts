To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for itm in mex:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `itm` and `mex`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `mex` list. If `mex` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second time.

At the end of the last iteration, `mex` has at least one element, and `itm` is the first element in `mex`. For the loop to execute again, `mex` must have at least two elements, and `itm` must be the second element in `mex`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is a list of absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 2 elements, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and `itm` is the second element in `mex`**
