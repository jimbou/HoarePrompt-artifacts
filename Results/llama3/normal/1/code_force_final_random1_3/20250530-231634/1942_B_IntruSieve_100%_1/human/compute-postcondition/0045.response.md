To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itm` and `mex`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `mex` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `mex` has at least 2 elements, `itm` is the second element in the list.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `mex` must have at least 3 elements, and `itm` is the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` is a list of absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 3 elements, `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and `itm` is the third element in `mex`.**
