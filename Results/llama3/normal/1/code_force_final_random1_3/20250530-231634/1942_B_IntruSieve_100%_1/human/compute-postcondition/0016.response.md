To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `minn in used` and adjust the states of `minn` and `used` accordingly.

According to the given state, `minn` is either greater than or equal to `n+1` or `0`, depending on the first element of `arr`. `used` contains keys from `0` to `n` with a value of `True` if the first element of `arr` is greater than `0`, or the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` as a key with a value of `True`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `minn` must be in `used`. Since `minn` is either greater than or equal to `n+1` or `0`, we need to adjust the state of `minn` to ensure it falls within the range of keys in `used`.

If `minn` is greater than or equal to `n+1`, it will never be in `used` because `used` only contains keys up to `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `minn` to be within the range of keys in `used`.

If `minn` is `0`, it will be in `used` only if the first element of `arr` is greater than `0`. However, we cannot guarantee this condition. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `minn` to be a value that is guaranteed to be in `used`.

Considering these cases, we can adjust the state of `minn` to be a value between `0` and `n` (inclusive) to ensure it is in `used`. We can also adjust the state of `used` to include this value as a key with a value of `True`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`, `used` contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and `minn` is a value between 0 and n (inclusive)**
