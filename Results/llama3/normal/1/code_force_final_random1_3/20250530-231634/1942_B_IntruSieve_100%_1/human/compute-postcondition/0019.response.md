Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`, `used` contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, including the key `minn` with value True, and `minn` is a value between 2 and n+2 (inclusive)**

The code increments the value of `minn` by 1. The initial state of `minn` was a value between 1 and n+1 (inclusive), so after the increment, `minn` will be a value between 2 and n+2 (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
