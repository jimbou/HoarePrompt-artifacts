Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n. The element of arr at index i is not greater than 0. If the first element of arr is greater than 0, then mex contains 0 and the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and minn is greater than or equal to n+1. If the first element of arr is not greater than 0, then mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn, and the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0.**

The code adds the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn to mex. It also adds the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn as a key with a value of True to used. The values of n, i, and arr remain unchanged. The value of mex and used are updated based on the previous values of mex, used, and minn.
