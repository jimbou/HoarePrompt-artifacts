Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` of length `n`, where the integers are in the range `-n` to `n`.

2. The program initializes an empty list `mex` to store the calculated absolute differences, a variable `minn` to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used`, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used values.

3. The program then iterates over the list `arr`. If an element `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex`, marks `minn` as used, and increments `minn` until it finds a non-negative integer that is not in `used`. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, it appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to `mex` and marks this difference as used.

4. After processing the entire list `arr`, the program prints the calculated absolute differences in `mex`.

5. The program repeats this process for each test case in the input.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
