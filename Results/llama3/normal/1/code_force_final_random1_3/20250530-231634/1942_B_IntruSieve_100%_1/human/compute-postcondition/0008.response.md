The only variable in the loop head is variable minn and used, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable minn and used.  If minn is in used, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, minn is greater than 2 and used contains the key 1 with value True. For the loop to be executed one more time, minn must be in used, so minn must be equal to 1 and used must contain the key 1 with value True and also contain the key 2 with value True.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0, `minn` is 1, `used` contains the key 1 with value True and the key 2 with value True, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0**
