Postcondition: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n. If the first element of arr is greater than 0, then mex contains 0 and the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn if arr[i] is not greater than 0, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and minn is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in used if arr[i] is greater than 0, otherwise minn is greater than or equal to n+1. If the first element of arr is not greater than 0, then mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn, and the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn if arr[i] is not greater than 0, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and the absolute difference between the element of arr at index i and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0 if arr[i] is not greater than 0, otherwise minn is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in used.**
