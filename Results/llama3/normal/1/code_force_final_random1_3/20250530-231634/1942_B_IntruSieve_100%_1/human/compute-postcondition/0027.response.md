Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n. If the first element of arr is greater than 0, then mex contains 0 and minn, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and minn is greater than or equal to n+1. If the first element of arr is not greater than 0, then mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn, and minn, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to include `minn`, and the value of `used` has been updated to include `minn` as a key with a value of `True`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The value of `minn` remains the same, but its presence as a key in `used` and as an element in `mex` has been added.
