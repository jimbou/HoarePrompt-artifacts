Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, and another element which is the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and the absolute difference between the second element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` to `mex`, and added this difference as a key with a value of `True` to `used`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The rest of the variables retain their initial values, as they are not affected by the code.
