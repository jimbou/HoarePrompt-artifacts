Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains 0, minn is 0, used contains the key 0 with value True, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, the current value of arr[i] is greater than 0**

The code adds the value of `minn` to the list `mex` and sets the value of `used[minn]` to `True`. Since `minn` is 0, `mex` now contains the value 0, and `used` contains the key 0 with value `True`. The value of `minn` remains unchanged at 0. No other variables are affected.
