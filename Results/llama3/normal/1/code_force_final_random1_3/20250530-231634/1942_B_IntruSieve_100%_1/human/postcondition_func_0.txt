This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads a positive integer n and a list of integers of length n from stdin, where the integers are in the range -n to n. It then calculates the absolute differences between the elements of the list and a minimum value minn, and prints these differences. The function also keeps track of the used values in a dictionary. After processing the input, the function prints the calculated differences and an empty line. The final state of the program is that all input has been processed and the output has been printed.
