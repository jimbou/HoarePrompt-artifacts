Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0, `minn` is greater than 2, `used` contains the key 1 with value True, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0**

The code increments the value of `minn` by 1. Since `minn` was initially greater than 1, its new value is greater than 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is still greater than 0.
