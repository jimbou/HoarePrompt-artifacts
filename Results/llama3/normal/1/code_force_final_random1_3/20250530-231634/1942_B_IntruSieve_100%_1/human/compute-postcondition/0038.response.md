Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains the absolute differences between the elements of arr and minn if the elements are not greater than 0, used contains the absolute differences between the elements of arr and minn as keys with value True, and minn is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in used if any element of arr is greater than 0, otherwise minn is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* The list `arr` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
* The list `mex` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` if the elements are not greater than 0. This is because in each iteration, if the current element of `arr` is not greater than 0, the absolute difference between the element and `minn` is appended to `mex`.
* The dictionary `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value `True`. This is because in each iteration, if the current element of `arr` is not greater than 0, the absolute difference between the element and `minn` is added to `used` as a key with value `True`.
* The value of `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0. This is because in each iteration, if the current element of `arr` is greater than 0, `minn` is incremented until it is not in `used`. If no element of `arr` is greater than 0, `minn` remains 0.
