Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains 0, minn is greater than or equal to n+1, used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, the current value of arr[i] is greater than 0**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed until `minn` is greater than or equal to `n+1`, and all keys from 0 to `n` have been added to the `used` dictionary with a value of `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
