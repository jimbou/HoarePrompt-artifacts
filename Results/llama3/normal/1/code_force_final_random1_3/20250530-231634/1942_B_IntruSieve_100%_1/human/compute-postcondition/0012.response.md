Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, minn is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains 0 as it is not modified. The list `arr` remains the same as it is not modified. The list `mex` now contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`. The dictionary `used` now contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` as a key with a value of `True`. The value of `minn` remains 0 as it is not modified. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
