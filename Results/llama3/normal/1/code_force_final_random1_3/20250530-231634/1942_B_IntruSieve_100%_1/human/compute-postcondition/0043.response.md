The code prints the second element in the `mex` list, which contains absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn`, and a space. Where `mex` is a list of absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` that must have at least 2 elements, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `used` if any element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `minn` is 0, and `used` contains the absolute differences between the elements of `arr` and `minn` as keys with value True.
Output: **the second element in mex (where mex is a list of absolute differences between the elements of arr and minn), a space**
