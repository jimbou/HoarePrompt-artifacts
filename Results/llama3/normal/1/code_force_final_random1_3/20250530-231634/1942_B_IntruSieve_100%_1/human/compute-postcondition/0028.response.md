To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `minn in used`. This condition depends on the state of `minn` and `used`.

Given the initial states:

- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n

And the conditional states based on the first element of `arr`:

1. If the first element of `arr` is greater than 0:
   - `mex` contains 0 and `minn`
   - `used` contains all keys from 0 to n with value True
   - `minn` is greater than or equal to n+1

2. If the first element of `arr` is not greater than 0:
   - `mex` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`, the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn`, and `minn`
   - `used` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn` as a key with a value of True, the absolute difference between the second element of `arr` and `minn` as a key with a value of True, and `minn` as a key with a value of True
   - `minn` is 0

For the loop to execute the first time, `minn` must be in `used`. 

- In the first scenario, since `minn` is greater than or equal to n+1 and `used` contains keys from 0 to n, `minn` cannot be in `used` based on the given states. Therefore, this scenario does not need adjustment for the loop to potentially execute, but it actually cannot execute under the given conditions.

- In the second scenario, `minn` is 0, and since `used` contains `minn` as a key with a value of True, this scenario already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

However, to strictly follow the task's requirement for adjusting states so that the first iteration can proceed, we should focus on the condition that directly affects the loop's execution: `minn in used`. Given that `minn`'s state is dependent on the first element of `arr`, and considering the need to ensure the loop can execute, we should adjust the understanding of `minn`'s state to be compatible with being in `used`.

Since the direct adjustment of `minn` and `used` based on the given conditional states does not straightforwardly allow for the loop to execute in the first scenario, and the second scenario already allows for execution, the task's requirement seems to be more about ensuring compatibility rather than altering the given states drastically.

Therefore, the adjustment should focus on ensuring that `minn` can be in `used` based on the given conditions. However, given the constraints and the aim to not alter the states drastically but to ensure the loop can execute, the focus should be on the scenario where `minn` is already in `used`, which is the second scenario.

State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, and the first element of arr is not greater than 0**
