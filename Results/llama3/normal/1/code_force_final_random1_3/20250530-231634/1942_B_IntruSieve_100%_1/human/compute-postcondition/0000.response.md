Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers in the range -n to n, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it remains a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. Since the list contains integers in the range -n to n, `arr` becomes a list of integers in the range -n to n. The third line initializes `mex` as an empty list. The fourth line initializes `minn` as 0. The fifth line initializes `used` as an empty dictionary. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and after the execution of the code, one test case has been processed, so stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.
