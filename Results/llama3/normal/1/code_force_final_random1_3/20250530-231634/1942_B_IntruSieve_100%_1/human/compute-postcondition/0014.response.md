State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the first element of arr is greater than 0, then mex contains 0, minn is greater than or equal to n+1, and used contains all keys from 0 to n with value True. Otherwise, mex contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn, used contains the absolute difference between the first element of arr and minn as a key with a value of True, and minn is 0.**
