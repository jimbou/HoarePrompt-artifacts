Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers in the range -n to n, `mex` contains 0 if the first element of `arr` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` contains the absolute difference between the first element of `arr` and `minn`, `used` contains all keys from 0 to n with value True, and `minn` is a value between 3 and n (inclusive)**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, so it is now a value between 3 and n (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
