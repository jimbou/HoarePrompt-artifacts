Output State: **dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 7, dp[4] is 25, dp[5] is 59, dp[6] is 129, dp[7] is 247, dp[8] is 463, dp[9] is 871, dp[10] is 1625, i is 10, and n is 10.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the values of dp[1] and dp[2] remain unchanged, dp[3] to dp[10] have been calculated and assigned values according to the loop's formula, the loop counter i has reached 10, and the value of n is 10, indicating that the loop has executed 8 times (from 3 to 10).
