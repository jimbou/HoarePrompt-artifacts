#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 7, dp[4] is 25, dp[5] is 59, dp[6] is 129, dp[7] is 247, dp[8] is 463, dp[9] is 871, dp[10] is 1625, i is 10, and n is 10.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and populates the dp array with values up to the nth index, where each value dp[i] is calculated as (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) modulo 1000000007, with initial values dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3. The function returns the populated dp array.
