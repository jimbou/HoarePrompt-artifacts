Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for the given chessboard and moves.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for each size of the chessboard from 1 to n. The base cases are dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3, which are correct.

The recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007 is also correct. It calculates the number of possible configurations for a chessboard of size i by considering two cases:

1. The last row is not used: In this case, the number of possible configurations is the same as the number of possible configurations for a chessboard of size i - 1, which is dp[i - 1].
2. The last row is used: In this case, there are i - 1 possible positions for the rook in the last row. For each of these positions, the number of possible configurations for the remaining rows is dp[i - 2]. Therefore, the total number of possible configurations in this case is 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2].

The program then uses the calculated values of dp to find the number of possible final configurations for the given chessboard and moves. It subtracts the number of invalid positions (i.e., the positions that have already been occupied by rooks) from the size of the chessboard to get the size of the remaining chessboard, and then prints the corresponding value of dp.

Correctness: **True**
