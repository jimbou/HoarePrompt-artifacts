Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for each value of n from 1 to 300000.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first initializes a list `dp` of size 300007 with all elements set to -1. This list will be used to store the number of possible configurations for each value of n.

2. The program then calls the function `func_1(300000)`, which calculates the number of possible configurations for each value of n from 1 to 300000 using dynamic programming. The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which represent the number of possible configurations for a 1x1 and 2x2 chessboard, respectively.

3. The recursive formula used to calculate `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This formula takes into account the number of possible configurations for the previous two values of n and calculates the number of possible configurations for the current value of n.

4. After calculating the number of possible configurations for each value of n, the program reads the input for the number of test cases `t`.

5. For each test case, the program reads the input for the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`. It then reads the input for the `k` moves, which are stored in a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

6. Finally, the program prints the maximum of 1 and `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which represents the number of possible final configurations for the given test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given input. However, there are a few potential issues with the program:

* The program uses a recursive function `func_1` to calculate the number of possible configurations, which could potentially lead to a stack overflow for large values of n. It would be better to use an iterative approach to calculate the number of possible configurations.

* The program uses a list `dp` of size 300007 to store the number of possible configurations for each value of n. This list could potentially be too large for some systems, and it would be better to use a more memory-efficient approach to store the number of possible configurations.

* The program does not handle invalid input. For example, if the input for `n` or `k` is negative, the program will produce incorrect results. It would be better to add error checking to handle invalid input.

Overall, the program's logic is correct, but it could be improved by using an iterative approach to calculate the number of possible configurations, using a more memory-efficient approach to store the number of possible configurations, and adding error checking to handle invalid input.

Correctness: **True**
