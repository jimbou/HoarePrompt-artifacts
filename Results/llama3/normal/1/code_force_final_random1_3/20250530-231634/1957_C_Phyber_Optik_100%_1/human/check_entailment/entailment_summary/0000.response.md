Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program correctly uses dynamic programming to calculate this.

2.  The dynamic programming (dp) array is initialized with a size of 300007, which is sufficient to handle the maximum possible value of n (3 \* 10^5).

3.  The base cases for the dp array are correctly set as dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3.

4.  The recursive formula for calculating dp[i] is correct. It takes into account the number of ways to place a white rook in the current row and the number of ways to place a black rook in the current column.

5.  The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the user's move (i.e., when r = c). In this case, the computer skips its turn, and the number of possible configurations remains the same.

6.  The program correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations by taking the maximum of 1 and dp[n - len(invalid)]. This is because there might be cases where n - len(invalid) is 0 or negative, in which case the number of possible configurations is 1.

7.  The program correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

8.  The program correctly reads the input and processes it according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
