The code calculates the value of `dp[i]` using the values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. Since `i` is 3, we can substitute the values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` into the equation.

`dp[3]` is assigned the value `(dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`. Since `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3, we can substitute these values into the equation.

`dp[3]` is assigned the value `(3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`. This simplifies to `(3 + 4) % 1000000007`, which is `7 % 1000000007`.

Since `n` must be greater than 2, the value of `n` is not affected by the code. The value of `i` is also not affected, as it is only used to index the `dp` array.

The output state is: `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2.**
