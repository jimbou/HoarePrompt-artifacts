Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 59, `i` is 5, and `n` is greater than 5**

In this output state, the values of `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `dp[3]`, and `dp[4]` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `dp[5]` is calculated using the given formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Substituting `i = 5`, we get `dp[5] = (dp[4] + 2 * 4 * dp[3]) % 1000000007 = (25 + 2 * 4 * 7) % 1000000007 = 59`. The value of `i` remains the same, and the value of `n` is still greater than 5.
