Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for the given problem.

The program first initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of size `n+1` with all elements set to `-1`. It then defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates and populates the `dp` array with values up to the `n`-th index.

The function uses the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` to calculate the `i`-th value in the `dp` array, with initial values `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. This recurrence relation is derived from the problem statement, where each move can be either a new row or a new column, and the computer's move is determined by the player's move.

The main part of the program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`, followed by `k` moves.

For each test case, the program calculates the number of invalid positions (i.e., positions that are already occupied by a rook) and stores them in a set `invalid`. It then prints the maximum of `1` and `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which represents the number of possible final configurations.

The program uses the `sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)` function to increase the recursion limit, which is necessary because the `func_1(n)` function uses recursion to calculate the `dp` array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, and it handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
