To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 3.

The code is: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`

Now, let's calculate the output state:

`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

Since `i` is 4, `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[2]` which is 3.

So, `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `(7 + 2 * (4 - 1) * 3) % 1000000007`.

Simplifying the expression, we get: `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `(7 + 2 * 3 * 3) % 1000000007`.

Further simplifying, we get: `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `(7 + 18) % 1000000007`.

Finally, we get: `dp[i]` is assigned the value of `25 % 1000000007`.

Since `25 % 1000000007` is 25, `dp[i]` is assigned the value of 25.

Therefore, the output state is: `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 3.

Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 3.**
