To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. Since `i` is now 5, `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `i` is 5, and `n` is greater than 5**
