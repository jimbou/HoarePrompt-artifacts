Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for each possible number of remaining valid moves. The function func_1 calculates the number of configurations for each number of remaining valid moves from 1 to n, and stores the results in the dp array.

The main part of the program then reads the input, calculates the number of invalid moves (i.e., moves that have already been made), and prints the number of configurations for the remaining valid moves.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror a move (i.e., when r = c), and it correctly calculates the number of configurations for each possible number of remaining valid moves.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are no valid moves remaining, in which case it prints 1 (since there is only one possible configuration in this case).

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
