The code prints the result of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, which is a combination of variables `n`, `i`, `idx_A`, and `l`.

Based on the initial state, we know that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is unchanged, and `l` is unchanged.

The expression `n - i` will result in a value equal to `n - 1`, since `i` is 1.

The expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` will result in a value equal to `(1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, since `i` is 1.

Since `idx_A` is unchanged, we can't determine the exact value of `idx_A[l - 1]`. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **n - 1 + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 (where n is a value greater than 1 and idx_A[l - 1] is the value of idx_A at index l - 1)**
