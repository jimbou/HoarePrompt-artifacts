Postcondition: ***`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the new value of `i` plus one is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, `b` is equal to `B[r]` if `r - l` is less than 0. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` is 0, then the value of `n` minus the new value of `i` plus 2 times the difference between the new value of `i` and the value of `idx_A` at index `l - 1` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the value of `B` at index `r`, `b` is equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus the value of `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. In this case, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is the value of `B` at index `r`, `b` is the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus the value of `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`, and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and the new value of `i`.***
