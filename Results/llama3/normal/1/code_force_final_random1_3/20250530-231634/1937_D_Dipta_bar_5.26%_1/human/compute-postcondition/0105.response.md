The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`s` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is unchanged, `idx_A` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `idx_B` is unchanged, `B` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, and `r` is unchanged**
