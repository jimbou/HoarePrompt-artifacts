Postcondition: ***`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l`, `r` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. If `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and the new value of `i` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (i+1)) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed.***
