Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '>'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of '<' and '>' characters, `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` is still 0. The list `idx_A` now has at least two elements, with the last element being 0. The list `A` has an additional element `x`, which is calculated based on the previous elements of `A` and `idx_A`. The current character at index `i` in string `s` is still '>'.
