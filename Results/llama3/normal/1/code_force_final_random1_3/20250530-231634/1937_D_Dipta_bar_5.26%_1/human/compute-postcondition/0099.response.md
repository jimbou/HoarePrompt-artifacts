Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<', `B` is a list of integers where each element `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `idx_B` was not empty, otherwise `B` is a list containing a single element 0, `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is greater than 0, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, and `b` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `b` has been updated to include the additional term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
