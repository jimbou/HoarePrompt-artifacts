Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, i is equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still `n`, the list `A` contains integers calculated based on the indices of '>' characters in `s`, the list `idx_A` contains the indices of '>' characters in `s`, and the loop counter `i` is equal to the length of `s`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
