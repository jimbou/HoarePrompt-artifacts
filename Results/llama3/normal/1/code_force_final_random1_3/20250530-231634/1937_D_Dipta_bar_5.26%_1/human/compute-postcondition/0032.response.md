Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 0, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing `i` and all previous indices, If `idx_B` was empty, `B` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `B` is a list of integers and has an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0.**

In this output state, the value of `idx_B` has been updated to include the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `B` is also updated if `idx_B` was not empty, by appending a new element `x` which is calculated based on the previous values of `B` and `idx_B`.
