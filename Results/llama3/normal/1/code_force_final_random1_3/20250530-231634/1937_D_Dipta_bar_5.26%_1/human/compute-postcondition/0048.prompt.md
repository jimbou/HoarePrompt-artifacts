Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, i is equal to n, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 0, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing `i` and all previous indices. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list of indices containing `i` and all previous indices. If `idx_B` was empty, `B` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `B` is a list of integers and has an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 1. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list of indices containing `i`, `n - 1 - j`, and all previous indices, and `B` is a list of integers and has an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0. If `s[i]` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` is a list with an additional element `n - 3` appended to it. If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list with an additional element 0 appended to it. Otherwise, `B` is a list with an additional element `x` appended to it, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - (n - 3)) * len(idx_B)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
