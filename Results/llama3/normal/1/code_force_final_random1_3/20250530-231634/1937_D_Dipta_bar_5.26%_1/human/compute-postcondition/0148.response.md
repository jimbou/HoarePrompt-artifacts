Output State: **`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l`, `r` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `a` is the value of `A` at index `l`, `x` is the value of `r` minus (`l` + 2), `b` is the value of (`idx_B[r - 1]` - `i`) * (`l` + 1).**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables except `b` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and it is still less than `n`. The value of `a` is still the element at index `l` in list `A`. The value of `x` is still the difference between `r` and (`l` + 2). The value of `b` is now calculated as the product of (`idx_B[r - 1]` - `i`) and (`l` + 1).
