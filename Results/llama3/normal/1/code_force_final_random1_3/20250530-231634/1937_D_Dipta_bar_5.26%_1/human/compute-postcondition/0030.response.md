Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, i is equal to n - 1 - j, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices, j is 0, B has an additional element x which is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for list B, which has an additional element x. The value of x is calculated based on the last element of B, the last index of idx_B, the current value of i, and the length of idx_B. The rest of the variables, including s, n, i, A, idx_A, and j, retain their original values and properties.
