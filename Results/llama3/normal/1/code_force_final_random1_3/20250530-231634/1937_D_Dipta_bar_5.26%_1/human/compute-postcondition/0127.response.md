Output State: **s is unchanged, n is greater than 1, i is 1, A is unchanged, idx_A is unchanged, j is unchanged, idx_B is unchanged, B is unchanged, l is unchanged, r is decreased by 1, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, and b is B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l).**

The code modifies the value of `b` in two steps. Initially, `b` is equal to `B[r]`. The first line subtracts `B[r - l]` from `b`, making it `B[r] - B[r - l]`. The second line further subtracts `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from `b`, resulting in the final value of `b` being `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. No other variables are affected by the code.
