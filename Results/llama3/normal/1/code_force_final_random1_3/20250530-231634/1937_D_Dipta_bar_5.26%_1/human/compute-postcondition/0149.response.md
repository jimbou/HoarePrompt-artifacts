Based on the given initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `a` is the value of `A` at index `l`.
* `x` is the value of `r` minus (`l` + 2).
* `b` is the value of (`idx_B[r - 1]` - `i`) * (`l` + 1).
* `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is greater than the new value of `i`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`

The expression inside the print statement can be broken down as follows:

* `a * 2` is twice the value of `A` at index `l`.
* `b * 2` is twice the value of (`idx_B[r - 1]` - `i`) * (`l` + 1).
* `i + 1` is the new value of `i` plus 1.

Since we don't have explicit values for `A`, `idx_B`, `r`, `l`, and `i`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as:

Output: **twice the value of A at index l, plus twice the value of (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1), plus the new value of i plus 1**

Note that this output description is based on the given initial state and the structure of the print statement. If more information about the variables and their values is provided, a more precise output description can be given.
