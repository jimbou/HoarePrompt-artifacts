Output State: **s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, l are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, r is decreased by 1, a is equal to the value of B at index r, b is equal to the value of A at index l - 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `B` at index `r` to `a`, and the value of `A` at index `l - 1` to `b`. The values of `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is still greater than the new value of `i`. The value of `r` is decreased by 1.
