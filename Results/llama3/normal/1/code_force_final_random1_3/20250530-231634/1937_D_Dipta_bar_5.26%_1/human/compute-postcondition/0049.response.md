Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to -1, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list of indices containing all indices i where s[i] is '<', B is a list of integers where each element x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0, l is 0, and r is equal to the length of B.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a value to a new variable. The first line assigns 0 to the variable `l`, and the second line assigns the length of the list `B` to the variable `r`. These assignments do not affect the values of any existing variables. The initial state remains unchanged, with the addition of the new variables `l` and `r` with their respective values.
