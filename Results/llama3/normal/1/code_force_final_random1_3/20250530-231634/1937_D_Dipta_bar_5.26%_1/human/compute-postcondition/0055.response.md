Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, i is 0, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list of indices containing all indices i where s[i] is '<', B is a list of integers where each element x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0, l is less than r, and r is equal to the length of B, a is equal to A[l], and b is equal to B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1).**

The provided code snippet modifies the value of variable `b`. The first line subtracts the value of `B[x]` from `b`, and the second line further subtracts the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)` from `b`. The values of `x`, `B[x]`, `idx_B[x]`, and `idx_B[r - 1]` are used in these calculations. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.
