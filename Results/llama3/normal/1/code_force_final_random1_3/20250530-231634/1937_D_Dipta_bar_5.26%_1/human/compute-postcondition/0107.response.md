Output State: **s is unchanged, n is greater than 1, i is 1, A is unchanged, idx_A is unchanged, j is unchanged, idx_B is unchanged, B is unchanged, l is unchanged, r is unchanged, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), and b is (B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)).**

In this final state, all variables except `b` remain unchanged from their initial values. The value of `b` is updated by subtracting the value of `B[x]` and then further subtracting the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)` from its original value `B[r - 1]`.
