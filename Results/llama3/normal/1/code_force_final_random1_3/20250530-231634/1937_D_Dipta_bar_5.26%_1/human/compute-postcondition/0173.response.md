Output: **`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `r` is decreased by 1, and this is printed: the value of `n` minus the new value of `i` plus 2 times the difference between the new value of `i` and the value of `idx_A` at index `l - 1`**
