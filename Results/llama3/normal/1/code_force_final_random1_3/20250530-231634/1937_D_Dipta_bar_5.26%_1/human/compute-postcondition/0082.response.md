Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, i is 0, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list of indices containing all indices i where s[i] is '<', B is a list of integers where each element x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0, l is larger than 0, and r is equal to the length of B minus 1, a is equal to A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, and b is equal to B[r].**

The code executes in the following way: The first line assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `a`. The second line increments `a` by `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. The third line assigns the value of `B[r]` to `b`. No other variables are affected.
