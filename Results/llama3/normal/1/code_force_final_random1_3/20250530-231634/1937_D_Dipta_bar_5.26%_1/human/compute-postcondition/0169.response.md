The code prints a value calculated from the variables `a`, `b`, and `i`. 

The value of `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`. This means `a` is the value of `A` at index `l - 1`, incremented by the difference between the current value of `i` and the value of `idx_A` at index `l - 1`, multiplied by `l`.

The value of `b` depends on the condition `r - l < 0`. If this condition is true, `b` is equal to `B[r]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]`, minus the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)`, plus the product of `(idx_B[r] - i)` and `l`. This means `b` is the value of `B` at index `r`, adjusted by the differences between the current value of `i` and the values of `idx_B` at indices `r - l` and `r`, multiplied by `r - l` and `l` respectively.

The value of `i` is increased by 1 from its initial state.

The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` calculates the sum of twice the values of `a` and `b`, plus the new value of `i` plus 1.

Output: **(2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l)) + (2 * (B[r] if r - l < 0 else B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l)) + (i + 1)**
