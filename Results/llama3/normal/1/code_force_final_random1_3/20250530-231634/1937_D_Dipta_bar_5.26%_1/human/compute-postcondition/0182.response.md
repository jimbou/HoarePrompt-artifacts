Postcondition: ***`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is the value of `A` at index `l`, `x` is the value of `r` minus (`l` + 2), `b` is the value of (`idx_B[r - 1]` - `i`) * (`l` + 1), and the sum of the double of `a` and the double of `b` and `i` plus 1 is printed. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and the new value of `i` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (i+1)) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed. If `s[i]` is not '>', then `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the new value of `i` plus one is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, `b` is equal to `B[r]` if `r - l` is less than 0. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` is 0, then the value of `n` minus the new value of `i` plus 2 times the difference between the new value of `i` and the value of `idx_A` at index `l - 1` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the value of `B` at index `r`, `b` is equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus the value of `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. In this case, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is the value of `B` at index `r`, `b` is the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus the value of `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`, and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and the new value of `i`.***
