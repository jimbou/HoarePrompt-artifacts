Output: **(2 * (B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r)) + (2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r)) + (n - i) (where B[r - 1] is the last element of the list B, idx_B[r - 1] is the last index of '<' in the string s, r is the length of the list B, A[l - 1] is the last element of the list A, idx_A[l - 1] is the last index of '>' in the string s, l is the length of the list A, i is 0, and n is greater than 0)**
