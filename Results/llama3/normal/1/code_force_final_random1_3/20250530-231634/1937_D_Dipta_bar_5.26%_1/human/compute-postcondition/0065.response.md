Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, i is 0, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list of indices containing all indices i where s[i] is '<', B is a list of integers where each element x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0, l is equal to r which is equal to the length of B, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated according to the provided code snippet. The value of `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, where `B[r - 1]` is the last element of list `B`, `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last index in list `idx_B`, `i` is the current index, and `r` is the length of list `B`. The value of `b` is simply the last element of list `A`, which is `A[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
