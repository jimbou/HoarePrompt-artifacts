Postcondition: ***`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B` are unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, "2" is printed. Otherwise, `l` is unchanged, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, and if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, and `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed.***
