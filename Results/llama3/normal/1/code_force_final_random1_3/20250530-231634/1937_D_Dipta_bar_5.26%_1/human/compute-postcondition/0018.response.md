Output State: **A is a list with an additional element x, x is equal to A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A), s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 1, i is 2**

The code snippet provided modifies the list A by appending a new element x. The value of x is calculated based on the last element of A, the difference between the current index i and the last index in idx_A, and the length of idx_A. The string s, the value of n, and the value of i remain unchanged.
