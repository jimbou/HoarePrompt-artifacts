The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list of indices containing `i`, `n - 1 - j`, and all previous indices, and `B` is a list of integers and has an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0. If `s[i]` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
