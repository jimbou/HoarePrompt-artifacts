The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. 

Here's a breakdown of the variables involved in the expression:

- `a` is `B[r]`, where `B` is unchanged and `r` is decreased by 1. This means `a` is the value of the element at index `r` in the list `B`, where `r` has been decremented by 1.

- `b` is calculated based on a conditional statement. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and the difference between `l` and `r` plus 1, plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `r` plus 1. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1]` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `r` plus 1.

- `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. So, `n - i` will be `n - 1`.

The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` multiplies `a` and `b` by 2, adds them together, and then adds `n - i` to the result.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **2 * B[r] + 2 * (A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)) + (n - 1) if l - r - 1 > 0, otherwise 2 * B[r] + 2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)) + (n - 1)**
