Output State: **s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, l, r, a, j, n are unchanged. If x >= 0, then b is (B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)). Otherwise, b is B[r - 1]. i is changed to (idx_B[r - 1] - b / (l + 1)).**

In this output state, the values of s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, l, r, a, j, and n remain unchanged. The value of b is now calculated as (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1), which means it is a function of idx_B[r - 1], i, and l. The value of i is updated to (idx_B[r - 1] - b / (l + 1)), which is a function of idx_B[r - 1], b, and l. The condition for x >= 0 still applies, and the value of b is still dependent on this condition.
