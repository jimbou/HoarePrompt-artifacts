Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<', `B` is a list of integers where each element `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `idx_B` was not empty, otherwise `B` is a list containing a single element 0, `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is greater than 0, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, and `b` is equal to `A[l - 1]`.**

The code assigns the value of `B[r]` to `a` and the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. Since `r` is greater than 0 and `l` is greater than `r`, `a` and `b` are assigned specific values from the lists `B` and `A` respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
