Postcondition: ***`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l`, `r` are unchanged. If `s[i]` is '>', then if `l + 1` < `r`, `(2 * a) + (2 * b) + i + 1` is printed, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `n`. If `l + 1` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, `n - 1` is printed. If `r` is not 0, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `n`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, "2" is printed. Otherwise, `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `n`. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n` minus `i` plus the product of `i` minus the value at index `l - 1` of `idx_A` and 2 is printed. Otherwise, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `n`.***
