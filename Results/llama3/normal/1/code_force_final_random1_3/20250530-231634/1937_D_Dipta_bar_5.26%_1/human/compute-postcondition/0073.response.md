Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<', `B` is a list of integers where each element `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `idx_B` was not empty, otherwise `B` is a list containing a single element 0, `l` is less than or equal to `r` which is equal to the length of `B`. The current value of `s[i]` is '>'. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is equal to `A[l]`, and `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` (where `a` is the element at index `l` of list `A`, `b` is the product of the difference between the last index of '<' character in `s` and `i`, and `l + 1`, and `i` is 0), followed by a space. If `l` is equal to `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and `i` which is `n` is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r <= 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and this is printed: `2 * a + 2 * b + (n - i)`.***
