The code prints a value calculated based on the variables `a`, `b`, and `i`. 

The value of `a` is unchanged and remains as it was before the code execution.

The value of `b` depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is calculated as `(B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1))`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r - 1]`.

The value of `i` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - b / (l + 1))`.

The `print` statement multiplies `a` and `b` by 2, adds `i` and 1 to the result, and prints the final value.

Output: **2a + 2b + i + 1 (where a is the unchanged value of a, b is B[r - 1] if x is less than 0, otherwise (B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)), and i is (idx_B[r - 1] - b / (l + 1)))**
