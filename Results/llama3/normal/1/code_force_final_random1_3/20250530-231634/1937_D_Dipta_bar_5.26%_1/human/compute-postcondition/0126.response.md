Output State: **s is unchanged, n is greater than 1, i is 1, A is unchanged, idx_A is unchanged, j is unchanged, idx_B is unchanged, B is unchanged, l is unchanged, r is decreased by 1, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, and b is B[r].**

The code block assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `a`, then increments `a` by the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`. Finally, it assigns the value of `B[r]` to `b`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, and `l` remain unchanged, while `r` is decreased by 1.
