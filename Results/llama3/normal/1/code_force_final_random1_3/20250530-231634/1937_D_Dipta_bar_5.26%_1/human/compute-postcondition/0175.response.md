Output State: **s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, r is decreased by 1, a is equal to the value of B at index r, b is equal to the value of A at index l - 1 minus the value of A at index l - r - 2 and minus the product of the difference between idx_A at index l - 1 and idx_A at index l - r - 2 and l - r - 1.**

In this final state, all variables that were not modified by the code retain their original values. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and `n` remains greater than this new value of `i`. The value of `r` has been decreased by 1. The value of `a` is still equal to the value of `B` at index `r`. The value of `b` has been updated to be equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1`, minus the value of `A` at index `l - r - 2`, and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1`.
