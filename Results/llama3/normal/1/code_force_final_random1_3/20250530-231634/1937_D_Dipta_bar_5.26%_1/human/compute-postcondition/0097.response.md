Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, i is 0, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list of indices containing all indices i where s[i] is '<', B is a list of integers where each element x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0, l is greater than r, and r is greater than 0, a is equal to B[r], and b is equal to A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1).**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` and `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` from its original value `A[l - 1]`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. All other variables retain their original values as they are not affected by the code.
