Based on the precondition, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `a` is equal to `A[l]`, where `A` is a list of integers and `l` is less than `r`. Since `l` is an index into the list `A`, `a` will be an integer value from the list `A`.
* `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Here, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<', and `r` is equal to the length of `B`. Since `r` is the length of `B`, `r - 1` will be the last index of `B`. Therefore, `idx_B[r - 1]` will be the last index `i` where `s[i]` is '<'. The expression `(idx_B[r - 1] - i)` will be the difference between this last index and the current index `i`. Multiplying this difference by `(l + 1)` will give an integer value.
* `i` is 0, as given in the precondition.
* The `end` parameter of the `print` function is set to `' '`, which means that a space will be printed after the calculated value.

Now, let's put it all together:

The print statement will calculate the value `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is an integer value from the list `A`, `b` is an integer value calculated based on the indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, and `i` is 0. The result will be an integer value. After calculating this value, a space will be printed.

Output: **an integer value (a * 2 + b * 2 + 1) followed by a space**
