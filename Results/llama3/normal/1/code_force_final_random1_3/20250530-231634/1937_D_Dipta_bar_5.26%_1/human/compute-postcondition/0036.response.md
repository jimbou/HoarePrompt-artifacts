Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 1, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing `i` and all previous indices. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list of indices containing `i` and all previous indices. `B` is a list of integers and has an additional element 0.**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the list `B` now has an additional element, which is 0. This is because the code `B.append(0)` adds a new element to the end of the list `B`. The other variables are not affected by this code.
