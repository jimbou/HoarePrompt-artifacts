Output State: **The final state of the variables after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, and the values of `l` and `r` depend on the number of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`. If the number of '>' characters is greater than or equal to the number of '<' characters, `l` is equal to the number of '>' characters and `r` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is equal to the number of '<' characters and `r` is equal to the difference between the number of '<' characters and the number of '>' characters.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variables `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `j` retain their initial values. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The values of `l` and `r` depend on the balance between '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`. If there are more '>' characters or an equal number of '>' and '<' characters, `l` is equal to the number of '>' characters and `r` is 0. If there are more '<' characters, `l` is equal to the number of '<' characters and `r` is equal to the difference between the number of '<' characters and the number of '>' characters.
