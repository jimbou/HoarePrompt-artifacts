Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list with at least three elements where the last element is 1, and `A` is a list with additional elements. If `idx_A` had two elements before, `A` has an additional element 0, where the second last element of `A` is equal to `A[len(A) - 3] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`. Otherwise, `A` has two additional elements `x` and `x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`. If `s[i]` is not '>', the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
