Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, if `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.***
