Postcondition: ***s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, l, r are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, a is the value of A at index l, x is the value of r minus (l + 2), b is the value of B at index (r - 1) minus B[x] minus (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) if x >= 0. Otherwise, s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, l, r are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, a is the value of A at index l, x is the value of r minus (l + 2), b is the value of B at index (r - 1).***
