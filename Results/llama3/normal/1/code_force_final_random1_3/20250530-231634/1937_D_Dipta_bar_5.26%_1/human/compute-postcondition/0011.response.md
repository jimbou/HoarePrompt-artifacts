Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, if `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element 0, where the second last element of `A` is equal to `A[len(A) - 3] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of '<' and '>' characters, and `n` remains greater than 1. The value of `i` is still 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', then the list `idx_A` still has at least two elements with the last element being 0. The list `A` now has an additional element, which is 0. The second last element of `A` is still equal to the expression `A[len(A) - 3] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
