Postcondition: ***s is unchanged, n is greater than 1, i is 1, A is unchanged, idx_A is unchanged, j is unchanged, idx_B is unchanged, B is unchanged, l is unchanged, r is decreased by 1, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, and if r - l is greater than or equal to 0, b is B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l). Otherwise, b is B[r].***
