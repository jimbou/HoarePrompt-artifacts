Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, i is equal to n, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list**

The code initializes two new variables, B and idx_B, both of which are empty lists. The initial state remains unchanged, with s being a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n being the length of s, A being a list of integers, idx_A being a list of indices of '>' characters in s, and i being equal to n. The introduction of B and idx_B does not affect the existing variables, so their values remain the same.
