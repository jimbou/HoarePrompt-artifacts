    #State: The final state of the variables after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, and the values of `l` and `r` depend on the number of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`. If the number of '>' characters is greater than or equal to the number of '<' characters, `l` is equal to the number of '>' characters and `r` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is equal to the number of '<' characters and `r` is equal to the difference between the number of '<' characters and the number of '>' characters.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters as input and prints a sequence of numbers. The sequence is generated based on the arrangement of '<' and '>' characters in the string. For each character in the string, the function calculates a value based on the number of '<' and '>' characters encountered so far and their positions, and prints this value. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the sequence of numbers directly.
