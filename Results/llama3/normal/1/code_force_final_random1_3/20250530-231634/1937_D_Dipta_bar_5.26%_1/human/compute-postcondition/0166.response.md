Output State: **s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, l are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, r is decreased by 1, a is equal to A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, b is equal to B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l).**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `n` is still greater than the new value of `i`. The value of `r` is decreased by 1. The value of `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, and the value of `b` is calculated as `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)`.
