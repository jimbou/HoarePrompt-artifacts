To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the length of `s`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is now 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
