Postcondition: ***`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, the new value of `i` plus one is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, `b` is equal to `B[r]` if `r - l` is less than 0. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`***
