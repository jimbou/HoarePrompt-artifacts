Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` is a list with an additional element `n - 3` appended to it. If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list with an additional element 0 appended to it. Otherwise, `B` is a list with an additional element `x` appended to it, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - (n - 3)) * len(idx_B)`.***
