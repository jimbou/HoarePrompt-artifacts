Postcondition: ***`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B` are unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, "2" is printed. Otherwise, `l` is unchanged, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, and if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, and `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n` minus `i` plus the product of `i` minus the value at index `l - 1` of `idx_A` and 2 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r]`, and `b` is calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `l`, `r`, `i`, and `n`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and the difference between `l` and `r` plus 1, plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `r` plus 1. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1]` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `r` plus 1. In this case, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed.***
