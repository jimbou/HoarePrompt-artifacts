Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `idx_A` has an additional element 2, If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list with an additional element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of characters '<' and '>', the value of `n` is still greater than 1, and the value of `i` is still 2. The list `idx_A` now has an additional element, which is the current value of `i`, i.e., 2. The list `A` is updated according to the given condition: if `idx_A` is empty, `A` has an additional element 0; otherwise, `A` has an additional element `x`, where `x` is calculated based on the last element of `A`, the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`.
