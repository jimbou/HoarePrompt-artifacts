Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 0, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing `i` and all previous indices. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list of indices containing `i` and all previous indices. If `idx_B` was empty, `B` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `B` is a list of integers and has an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0.***
