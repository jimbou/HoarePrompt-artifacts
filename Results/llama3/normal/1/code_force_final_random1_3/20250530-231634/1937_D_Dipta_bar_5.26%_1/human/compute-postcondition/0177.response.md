Output State: **s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, r is decreased by 1, a is equal to the value of B at index r, b is equal to the value of A at index l - 1 plus the product of the difference between i and idx_A at index l - 1 and r + 1. If l - r - 1 > 0, then b is also equal to the value of A at index l - 1 minus the value of A at index l - r - 2 and minus the product of the difference between idx_A at index l - 1 and idx_A at index l - r - 2 and l - r - 1 plus the product of the difference between i and idx_A at index l - 1 and r + 1.**

In this output state, the values of s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, and j remain unchanged. The value of i has been increased by 1, and n is still greater than the new value of i. The value of r has been decreased by 1. The value of a is still equal to the value of B at index r. The value of b has been updated to be equal to the value of A at index l - 1 plus the product of the difference between i and idx_A at index l - 1 and r + 1. Additionally, if l - r - 1 > 0, then b is also equal to the value of A at index l - 1 minus the value of A at index l - r - 2 and minus the product of the difference between idx_A at index l - 1 and idx_A at index l - r - 2 and l - r - 1 plus the product of the difference between i and idx_A at index l - 1 and r + 1.
