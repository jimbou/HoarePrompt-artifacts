Output: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<', `B` is a list of integers where each element `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `idx_B` was not empty, otherwise `B` is a list containing a single element 0, `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is equal to the length of `B` minus 1. The character at index `i` in `s` is '<'. The current value of `r` is 0, and this is printed: `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`**
