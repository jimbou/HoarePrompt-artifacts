To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, if `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**
