Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, A is a list with an additional element x, idx_A is a list with at least one element, i is 0, and the current value of s[i] is '>', x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)**

Explanation: The code block consists of two lines. The first line calculates the value of x by adding the last element of list A to the product of the difference between the current index i and the last element of list idx_A, and the length of list idx_A. The second line appends the calculated value of x to list A. 

After the code executes, the value of x is added to list A, and the length of A increases by 1. The value of x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A), where A[len(A) - 2] is the last element of A before the code executes. The values of s, n, idx_A, and i remain unchanged.
