Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0. The current value of `i` is such that the character at index `i` in `s` is '<'.**
