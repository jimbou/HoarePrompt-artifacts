Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to -1, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list of indices containing all indices i where s[i] is '<', B is a list of integers where each element x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0, l is 0, and r is equal to the length of B.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program maintains the state of the variables `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, and `r` as described in the precondition. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program prints a value based on the current state of the variables. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the program prints a value based on the current state of the variables. If the current value of `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` (which is 1) is printed. Otherwise, the program calculates a value `b` based on the values of `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, and `i`, and prints the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the program. If `l` is greater than `r`, the program prints a value based on the current state of the variables. If `r` is 0, then the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is printed. Otherwise, `r` is greater than 0, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, and `b` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` (or `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`), and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and the current index `i` which is 0, the output is `a * 2 + b * 2 + n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l`, `r` are unchanged. If `s[i]` is '>', then if `l + 1` < `r`, `(2 * a) + (2 * b) + i + 1` is printed, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `n`. If `l + 1` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, `n - 1` is printed. If `r` is not 0, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `n`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, "2" is printed. Otherwise, `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `n`. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n` minus `i` plus the product of `i` minus the value at index `l - 1` of `idx_A` and 2 is printed. Otherwise, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is the value of `A` at index `l`, `x` is the value of `r` minus (`l` + 2), `b` is the value of (`idx_B[r - 1]` - `i`) * (`l` + 1), and the sum of the double of `a` and the double of `b` and `i` plus 1 is printed. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and the new value of `i` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (i+1)) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed. If `s[i]` is not '>', then `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the new value of `i` plus one is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, `b` is equal to `B[r]` if `r - l` is less than 0. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` is 0, then the value of `n` minus the new value of `i` plus 2 times the difference between the new value of `i` and the value of `idx_A` at index `l - 1` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the value of `B` at index `r`, `b` is equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus the value of `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. In this case, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is the value of `B` at index `r`, `b` is the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus the value of `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`, and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and the new value of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
