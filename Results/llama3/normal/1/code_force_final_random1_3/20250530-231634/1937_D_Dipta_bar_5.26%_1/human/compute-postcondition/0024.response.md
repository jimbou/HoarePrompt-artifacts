To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the range `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is equal to `n`, we can infer that `i` should also be at least 1. The other variables `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
