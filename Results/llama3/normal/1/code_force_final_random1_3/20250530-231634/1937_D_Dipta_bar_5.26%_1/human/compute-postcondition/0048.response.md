Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to -1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<', and `B` is a list of integers where each element `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `idx_B` was not empty, otherwise `B` is a list containing a single element 0.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variables have reached their final state. The string `s` and the list `A` remain unchanged, while the index `i` has decremented to -1, indicating that the loop has finished. The list `idx_B` now contains all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<', and the list `B` contains the calculated values based on the indices in `idx_B`. The variable `j` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
