To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is initially -1, we need to adjust it to be within the range of the loop, which starts from 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<', `B` is a list of integers where each element `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `idx_B` was not empty, otherwise `B` is a list containing a single element 0, `l` is 0, and `r` is equal to the length of `B`.**
