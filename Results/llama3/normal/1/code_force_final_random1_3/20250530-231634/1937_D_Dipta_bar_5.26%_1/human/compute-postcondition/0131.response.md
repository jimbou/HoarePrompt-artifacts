Output: **`s` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is unchanged, `idx_A` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `idx_B` is unchanged, `B` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, and if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` (where `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, and `b` is either `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l` or `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, depending on whether `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is 1)**
