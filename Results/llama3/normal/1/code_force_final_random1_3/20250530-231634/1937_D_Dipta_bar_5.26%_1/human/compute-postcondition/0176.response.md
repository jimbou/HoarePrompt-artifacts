Postcondition: ***s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, r is decreased by 1, a is equal to the value of B at index r, b is equal to the value of A at index l - 1. If l - r - 1 > 0, then b is also equal to the value of A at index l - 1 minus the value of A at index l - r - 2 and minus the product of the difference between idx_A at index l - 1 and idx_A at index l - r - 2 and l - r - 1.***
