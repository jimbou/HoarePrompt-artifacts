Postcondition: **The program prints a value based on the current state of the variables. If the current value of `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` (which is 1) is printed. Otherwise, the program calculates a value `b` based on the values of `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, and `i`, and prints the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is not defined in the given precondition or postconditions, but is presumably a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the program. The program maintains the state of the variables `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, and `r` as described in the precondition.**
