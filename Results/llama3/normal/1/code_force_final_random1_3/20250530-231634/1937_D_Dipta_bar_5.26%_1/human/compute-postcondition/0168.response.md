Output State: **s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, l are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, r is decreased by 1, a is equal to A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, b is equal to B[r] if r - l is less than 0. Otherwise, b is equal to B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l) plus (idx_B[r] - i) times l.**

In this output state, the values of s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, and l remain unchanged. The value of i has been increased by 1, and n is still greater than the new value of i. The value of r has been decreased by 1. The value of a is still equal to A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l. The value of b has been updated to be equal to B[r] if r - l is less than 0, otherwise it is equal to B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l) plus (idx_B[r] - i) times l.
