Output State: **s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, l, r are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, a is the value of A at index l, x is the value of r minus (l + 2), b is the value of B at index (r - 1).**

In this final state, all variables that were not modified by the code (`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. The variable `i` has been increased by 1, and `n` is still greater than the new value of `i`. The new variables `a`, `x`, and `b` have been introduced with values derived from the existing variables: `a` is the value of `A` at index `l`, `x` is the result of subtracting (`l + 2`) from `r`, and `b` is the value of `B` at index (`r - 1`).
