The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value and `n` is some value greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l`, `r` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`.**
