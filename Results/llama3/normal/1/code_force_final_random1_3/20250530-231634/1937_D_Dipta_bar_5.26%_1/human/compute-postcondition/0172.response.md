The code prints the value of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, which is a combination of variables `n`, `i`, `idx_A`, and `l`.

Based on the initial state, we know that `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, which means `n - i` will be a positive integer.

The term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` depends on the values of `i`, `idx_A`, and `l`. Since `i` is increased by 1, its new value is `i + 1`. The value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not explicitly given, but it is an element of the `idx_A` list. Let's denote this value as `x`. Then, `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` becomes `(i + 1 - x) * 2`.

Now, let's combine the terms: `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` becomes `n - (i + 1) + (i + 1 - x) * 2`. Simplifying this expression, we get `n - 1 + 2(i + 1 - x)`.

Since `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `n - 1` is still a positive integer. The term `2(i + 1 - x)` is an even integer, as it is a multiple of 2.

Therefore, the output will be a positive integer, which is the result of adding a positive integer (`n - 1`) and an even integer (`2(i + 1 - x)`).

Output: **a positive integer (n - 1 + 2(i + 1 - idx_A[l - 1]))**
