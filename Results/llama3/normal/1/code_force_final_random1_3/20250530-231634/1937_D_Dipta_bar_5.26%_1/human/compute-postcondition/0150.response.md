Output: **`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l`, `r` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `a` is the value of `A` at index `l`, `x` is the value of `r` minus (`l` + 2), `b` is the value of (`idx_B[r - 1]` - `i`) * (`l` + 1), and this is printed: the sum of the double of `a` and the double of `b` and `i` plus 1, where `a` is the value of `A` at index `l`, `b` is the value of (`idx_B[r - 1]` - `i`) * (`l` + 1), and `i` is increased by 1**
