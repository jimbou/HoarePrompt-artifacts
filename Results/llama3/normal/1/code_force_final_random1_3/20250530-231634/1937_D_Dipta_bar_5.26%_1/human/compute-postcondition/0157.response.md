Based on the given initial state, let's break down the values of the variables involved in the print statement:

* `a`: This is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (i+1)) * r`. Since `i` is increased by 1, we need to consider the new value of `i`. However, without knowing the exact values of `B`, `idx_B`, `r`, and the new value of `i`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `a`. We can only describe it as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (new_i+1)) * r`.
* `b`: This is calculated differently based on the condition `l - r <= 0`. If `l - r <= 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Again, without knowing the exact values of `A`, `idx_A`, `l`, `r`, and the new value of `i`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `b`. We can only describe it as either `A[l - 1] + (new_i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` or `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (new_i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, depending on the condition.
* `n - i`: Since `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, this expression will evaluate to a positive integer. However, without knowing the exact values of `n` and the new value of `i`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n - i`.

Now, let's combine these values in the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')`

The output will be the sum of:

* `a * 2`, which is `2 * (B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (new_i+1)) * r)`
* `b * 2`, which is either `2 * (A[l - 1] + (new_i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r)` or `2 * (A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (new_i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r)`, depending on the condition
* `n - i`, which is a positive integer

Output: **(2 * (B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (new_i+1)) * r)) + (2 * (A[l - 1] + (new_i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) or 2 * (A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (new_i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r)) + (n - new_i)**
