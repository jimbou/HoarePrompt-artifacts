In this output state, the values of s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, l, and r remain unchanged. The value of i has been increased by 1, and n is still greater than the new value of i. The value of a is still B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (i+1)) * r. The value of b has been updated to A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r if l - r is less than or equal to 0. If l - r is greater than 0, the value of b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r.
