Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list with an additional element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`***
