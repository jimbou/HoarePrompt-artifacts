Output: **2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) + 2 * (B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l) + i + 1 (where A is unchanged, B is unchanged, i is 1, idx_A is unchanged, idx_B is unchanged, l is unchanged, r is decreased by 1, and r - l is greater than or equal to 0) or 2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) + 2 * (B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l) + i + 1 (where A is unchanged, B is unchanged, i is 1, idx_A is unchanged, idx_B is unchanged, l is unchanged, r is decreased by 1, and r - l is less than 0)**
