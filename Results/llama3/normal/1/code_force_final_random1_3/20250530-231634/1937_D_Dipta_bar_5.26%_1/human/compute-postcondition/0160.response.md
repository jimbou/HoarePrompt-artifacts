Postcondition: **`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l`, `r` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is the value of `A` at index `l`, `x` is the value of `r` minus (`l` + 2), `b` is the value of (`idx_B[r - 1]` - `i`) * (`l` + 1), and the sum of the double of `a` and the double of `b` and `i` plus 1 is printed. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and the new value of `i` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (i+1)) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed.**
