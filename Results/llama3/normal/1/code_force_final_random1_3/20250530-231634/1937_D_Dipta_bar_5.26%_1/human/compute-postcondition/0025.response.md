Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of '<' and '>' characters, and `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `i` has been updated to be equal to `n - 1 - j`, where `j` is still 0. The lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged, with `A` containing integers, `idx_A` containing indices of '>' characters in `s`, and `B` and `idx_B` being empty.
