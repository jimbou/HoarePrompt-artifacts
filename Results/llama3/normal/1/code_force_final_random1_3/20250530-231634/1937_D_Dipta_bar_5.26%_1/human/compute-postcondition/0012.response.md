Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 1, i is 1, idx_A is a list with at least two elements where the last element is 0, A is a list with two additional elements x and x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A), where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)**

In this output state, the string `s` and the value of `n` remain unchanged. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 1. The list `idx_A` still has at least two elements, with the last element being 0. The list `A` has been modified by appending two new elements. The first new element `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and the second new element is `x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
