Output State: **`s` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is unchanged, `idx_A` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `idx_B` is unchanged, `B` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, and `r` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables remain unchanged except for `r`, which has been decremented by 1. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, and `l` remain the same as in the initial state.
