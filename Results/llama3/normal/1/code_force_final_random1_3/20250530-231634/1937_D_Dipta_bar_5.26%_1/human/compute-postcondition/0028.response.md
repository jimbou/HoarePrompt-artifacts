Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list containing a single element 0, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0. The current value of `i` is such that the character at index `i` in `s` is '<'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of '<' and '>' characters, and `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `i` is still equal to `n - 1 - j`, and `A` remains a list of integers. The list `idx_A` still contains indices of '>' characters in `s`. The list `B` now contains a single element, which is 0. The list `idx_B` is still empty, and `j` is still 0. The character at index `i` in `s` is still '<'.
