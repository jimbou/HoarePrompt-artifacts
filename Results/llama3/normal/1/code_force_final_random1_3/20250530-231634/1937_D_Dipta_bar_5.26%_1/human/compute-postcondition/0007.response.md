Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is '>'. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `idx_A` is a list with at least one element.***
