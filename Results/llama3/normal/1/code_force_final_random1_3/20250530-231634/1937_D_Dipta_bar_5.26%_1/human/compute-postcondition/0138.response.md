Output State: **`s` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is unchanged, `idx_A` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `idx_B` is unchanged, `B` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, and `b` is `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and the difference between `l` and `r` plus 1, plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `r` plus 1, if `l - r - 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1]` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `r` plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `r` is decreased by 1. The value of `b` is updated by adding the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `r` plus 1 to its previous value. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, the previous value of `b` was `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and the difference between `l` and `r` plus 1. Otherwise, the previous value of `b` was `A[l - 1]`.
