Output State: **s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, l are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, r is decreased by 1, a is equal to A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, b is equal to B[r].**

In this output state, the variables s, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, n, j, and l remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The variable i has been increased by 1, and n is still greater than the new value of i. The variable r has been decreased by 1. The variable a has been assigned the value of A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, and the variable b has been assigned the value of B[r].
