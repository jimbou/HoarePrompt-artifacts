The code prints the value of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Let's break down the components of this expression:

*   `n` is greater than 0.
*   `i` is 0.
*   `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`. Since the character at index `i` in `s` is '<', `idx_A` does not contain the index `i`.
*   `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is equal to the length of `B` minus 1. Since `r` is 0, `l` must be at least 1.
*   `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last index in `idx_A` that is less than `l`. Since `l` is at least 1, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the first '>' character in `s`.

Now, let's evaluate the expression:

*   `n - i` is equal to `n` since `i` is 0.
*   `i - idx_A[l - 1]` is equal to the negative of the index of the first '>' character in `s` since `i` is 0.
*   `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is equal to twice the negative of the index of the first '>' character in `s`.

Therefore, the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is equal to `n` minus twice the index of the first '>' character in `s`.

Output: **n - 2 \* (index of the first '>' character in s)**
