Output: ** `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list of indices containing all indices `i` where `s[i]` is '<', `B` is a list of integers where each element `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `idx_B` was not empty, otherwise `B` is a list containing a single element 0, `l` is less than `r`, and `r` is equal to the length of `B`, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, and `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` (where `a` is the element at index `l` of list `A`, `b` is the product of the difference between the last index of '<' character in `s` and `i`, and `l + 1`, and `i` is 0), followed by a space**
