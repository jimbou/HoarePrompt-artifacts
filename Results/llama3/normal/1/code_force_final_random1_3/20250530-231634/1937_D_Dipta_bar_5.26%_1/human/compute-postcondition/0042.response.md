Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to `n - 3`**.

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to `n - 3` because `j` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged because the code only updates the value of `i`.
