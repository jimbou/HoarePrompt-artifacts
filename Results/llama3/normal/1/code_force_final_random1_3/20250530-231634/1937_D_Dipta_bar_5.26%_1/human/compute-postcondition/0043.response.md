Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2, `B` is a list with an additional element 0 appended to it.**

In this output state, the code has appended the value 0 to the list `B`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `s` still being a string of '<' and '>' characters, `n` greater than 2, `i` equal to `n - 3`, `A` a list of integers, `idx_A` a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, and `j` equal to 2.
