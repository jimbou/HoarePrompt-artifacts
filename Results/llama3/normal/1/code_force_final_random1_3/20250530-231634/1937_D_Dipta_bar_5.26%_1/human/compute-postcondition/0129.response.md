Output State: **`s` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is unchanged, `idx_A` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `idx_B` is unchanged, `B` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, and if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated based on the initial state conditions. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `b` is calculated by adding `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l` to the previous value of `b`, which was `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)`. If `r - l` is less than 0, the new value of `b` is simply `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
