Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2, `idx_B` is a list with an additional element `n - 3` appended to it, If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list with an additional element 0 appended to it. Otherwise, `B` is a list with an additional element `x` appended to it, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 2] + (idx_B[len(B) - 2] - (n - 3)) * len(idx_B)`**

In this output state, the value of `idx_B` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is equal to `n - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `B` is updated based on the new value of `idx_B`. If `idx_B` was empty, a 0 is appended to `B`. Otherwise, an element `x` is appended to `B`, where `x` is calculated based on the last two elements of `B` and the last element of `idx_B`.
