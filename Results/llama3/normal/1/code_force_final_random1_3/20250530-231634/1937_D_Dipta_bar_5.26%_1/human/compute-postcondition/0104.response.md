Postcondition: **The program maintains the state of the variables `s`, `n`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, and `r` as described in the precondition. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program prints a value based on the current state of the variables. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the program prints a value based on the current state of the variables. If the current value of `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` (which is 1) is printed. Otherwise, the program calculates a value `b` based on the values of `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, and `i`, and prints the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the program. If `l` is greater than `r`, the program prints a value based on the current state of the variables. If `r` is 0, then the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is printed. Otherwise, `r` is greater than 0, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, and `b` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` (or `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`), and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and the current index `i` which is 0, the output is `a * 2 + b * 2 + n`.**
