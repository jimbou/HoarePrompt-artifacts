Output State: **s, A, idx_A, n, j, l, r are unchanged, i is increased by 1, n is greater than the new value of i, a is the value of A at index l, x is the value of r minus (l + 2), b is the value of B at index (r - 1) minus B[x] minus (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1).**

The code snippet modifies the value of variable `b` in two steps. Initially, `b` is the value of `B` at index `(r - 1)`. The first line subtracts the value of `B` at index `x` from `b`. The second line further subtracts the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)` from `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
