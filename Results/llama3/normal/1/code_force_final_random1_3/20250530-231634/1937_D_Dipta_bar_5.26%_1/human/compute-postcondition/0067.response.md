Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, i is 0, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list of indices containing all indices i where s[i] is '<', B is a list of integers where each element x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0, l is equal to r which is equal to the length of B, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r).**

The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` and `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its original value `A[l - 1]`. The values of `l` and `r` are equal to the length of `B`, and `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. All other variables retain their initial values.
