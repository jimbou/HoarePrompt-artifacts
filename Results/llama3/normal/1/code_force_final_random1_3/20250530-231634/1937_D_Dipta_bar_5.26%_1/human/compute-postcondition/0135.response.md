Output State: **s is unchanged, n is greater than 1, i is 1, A is unchanged, idx_A is unchanged, j is unchanged, idx_B is unchanged, B is unchanged, l is unchanged, r is decreased by 1, a is B[r], and b is A[l - 1].**

The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to `a` and the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. Since `r` is decreased by 1, the value of `B[r]` is assigned to `a`. Similarly, the value of `A[l - 1]` is assigned to `b`. No other variables are affected by the code.
