Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices, `j` is 0. The current value of `i` is such that the character at index `i` in `s` is '<'. The length of `idx_B` is not equal to 0***
