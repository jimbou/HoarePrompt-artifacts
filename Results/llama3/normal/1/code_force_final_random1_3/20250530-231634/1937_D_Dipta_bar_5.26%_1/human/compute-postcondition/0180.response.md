Postcondition: **`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `j`, `l` are unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` is 0, then the value of `n` minus the new value of `i` plus 2 times the difference between the new value of `i` and the value of `idx_A` at index `l - 1` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to the value of `B` at index `r`, `b` is equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus the value of `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. In this case, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is the value of `B` at index `r`, `b` is the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus the value of `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`, and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and the new value of `i`.**
