Functionality: **This function takes a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters as input and prints a sequence of numbers. The sequence is generated based on the arrangement of '<' and '>' characters in the string. For each character in the string, the function calculates a value based on the number of '<' and '>' characters encountered so far and their positions, and prints this value. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the sequence of numbers directly.**
