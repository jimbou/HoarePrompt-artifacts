Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 1, i is equal to n - 1 - j, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, j is 1, idx_B is a list of indices containing i and all previous indices. If s[i] is '<', then idx_B is a list of indices containing i and all previous indices. B is a list of integers and has an additional element x which is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B) if idx_B was not empty, otherwise B is a list containing a single element 0.**

The code block calculates the value of `x` based on the last element of `B`, the last index of `idx_B`, the value of `i`, and the length of `idx_B`. It then appends this value to the list `B`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
