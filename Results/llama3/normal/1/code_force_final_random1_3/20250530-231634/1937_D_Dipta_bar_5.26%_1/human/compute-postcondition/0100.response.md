The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is the `r`-th element of list `B`, `b` is the `l-1`-th element of list `A` plus some adjustments based on the values of `i`, `idx_A`, `l`, and `r`, and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and the current index `i`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, `l`, `r`, and `B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is the r-th element of list B, b is the l-1-th element of list A plus adjustments, and n - i is the difference between n and the current index i)**
