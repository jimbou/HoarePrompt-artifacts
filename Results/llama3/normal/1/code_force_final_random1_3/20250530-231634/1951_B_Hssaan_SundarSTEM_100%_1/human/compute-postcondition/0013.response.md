Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the third element in the list `s`, `j` is increased by 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0 or 1. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.***
