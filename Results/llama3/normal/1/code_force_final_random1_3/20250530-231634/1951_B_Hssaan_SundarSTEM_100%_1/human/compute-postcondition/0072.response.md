Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k` - 1, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is the fourth element of `s`, `ans` is either 1 or 2**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
