The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and `i` is the third element of `s`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k` - 1, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is the third element of `s`, `ans` is 1**
