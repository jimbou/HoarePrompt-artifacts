Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `p` is `j+1`. If the first element of `s` is equal to the last element of the original `s`, then `ans1` is 0 and `z` is 1. If the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of the original `s`, then if the first element of `s` is greater than the last element of `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `z` is not 1, then `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.***
