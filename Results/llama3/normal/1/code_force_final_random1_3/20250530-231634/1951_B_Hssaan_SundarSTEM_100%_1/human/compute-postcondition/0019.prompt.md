Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index k - 1, ans is 0, h is the value of the first element in s, j is -1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `stdin` is empty. If the value of the first element in `s` is less than the second element in `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the third element in the list `s`, `j` is increased by 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0 or 1. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the fourth element in the list `s`, `j` is increased by 2. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0 or 1. If `h` is not less than `i`, `ans` is either 1 or 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 2 or 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
