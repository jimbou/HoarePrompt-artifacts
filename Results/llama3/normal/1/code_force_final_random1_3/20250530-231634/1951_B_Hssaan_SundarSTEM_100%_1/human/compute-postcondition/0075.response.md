Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k` - 1, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is the fourth element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `ans` is either 2 or 3.***
