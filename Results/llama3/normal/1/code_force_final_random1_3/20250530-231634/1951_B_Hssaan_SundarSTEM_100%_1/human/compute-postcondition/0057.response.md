State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, and then the element at index `j + 1` swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is the length of `s` minus 1, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` plus the number of elements in `s` that are less than `h` and come after the first occurrence of `h`, `z` is 1, and `i` is the last element of `s` that is less than or equal to `h`**
