Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, h is the k-1th element of the original s, j is not defined, p is not defined, ans is 0, ans1 is not defined, z is not defined, i is not defined, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `h` is the k-1th element of the original `s`, `j` is 1, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, `i` is the second element of the list. If the k-1th element of the list `s` is less than the second element of the list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `h` is the k-1th element of the original `s`, `j` is 2, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, `i` is the third element of the list. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `h` is the k-1th element of the original `s`, `j` is 3, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, `i` is the fourth element of the list. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
