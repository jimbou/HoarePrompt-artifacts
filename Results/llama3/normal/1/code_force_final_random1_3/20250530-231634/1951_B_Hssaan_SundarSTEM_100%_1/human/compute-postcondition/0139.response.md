Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `p` is `j+1`, the current value of `i` is equal to the current value of `h`, and `ans` is not defined. If the first element of `s` is equal to the last element of the original `s`, then `ans1` is 0 and `z` is 0. If the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of the original `s`, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 0.***
