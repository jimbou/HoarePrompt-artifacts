Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `ans` is 0, `h` is the value of the first element in `s`, `j` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the second element in `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values since the `break` statement does not modify any variables. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
