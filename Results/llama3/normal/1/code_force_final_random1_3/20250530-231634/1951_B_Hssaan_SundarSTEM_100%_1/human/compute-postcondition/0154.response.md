Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `p` is `j+1`, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
