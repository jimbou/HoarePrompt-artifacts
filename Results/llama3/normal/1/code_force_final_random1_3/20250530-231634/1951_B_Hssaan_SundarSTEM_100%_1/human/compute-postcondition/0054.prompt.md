Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index k - 1, and then the element at index j + 1 swapped with the element at index k - 1, j is the length of s minus 2, ans is the number of elements in s[1:] that are less than or equal to h, p is the length of s minus 1, ans1 is 0, z is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, and then the element at index `j + 1` swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is the length of `s` minus 1, `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 0, `z` is 1, and `i` is equal to `h`. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. Otherwise, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, and then the element at index `j + 1` swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is the length of `s` minus 1, `z` is 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is 2 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, and then the element at index `j + 1` swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 3, `p` is the length of `s` minus 2, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1 and `z` is still 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
