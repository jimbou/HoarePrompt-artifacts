Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k` - 1, `ans` is 0, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is the second element of `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
