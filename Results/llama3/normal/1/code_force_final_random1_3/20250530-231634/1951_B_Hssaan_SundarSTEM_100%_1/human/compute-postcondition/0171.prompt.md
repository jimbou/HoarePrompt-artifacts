Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers: n and k, where n is the number of cows (2 <= n <= 10^5) and k is the index of the cow (1 <= k <= n). The second line contains n space-separated integers: the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), which are all distinct.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j + 1
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, and then the element at index `j + 1` swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is the length of `s` minus 1, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` plus the number of elements in `s` that are less than `h` and come after the first occurrence of `h`, `z` is 1, and `i` is the last element of `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the length of `s`, `ans` is either the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are greater than or equal to `h` if `h` is less than the last element of `s`, or the length of `s` minus 1 if `h` is not less than the last element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `i` is equal to the last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are equal to `h` plus 1, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `i` is not equal to the last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are equal to `h` if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are equal to `h` plus 1, and `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is not greater than `h`, and `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are equal to `h` if `z` is 1, or the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are equal to `h` plus 1 if `z` is 1 and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are equal to `h` or the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are equal to `h` plus 1 respectively, and the maximum of `ans` and `ans1` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `p` is `j+1`, `i` is the last element of the list, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, `ans` is not defined, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is being printed, where `ans` is not defined and `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
