Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the length of `s`, `ans` is either the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are greater than or equal to `h` if `h` is less than the last element of `s`, or the length of `s` minus 1 if `h` is not less than the last element of `s`. If `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 2 if `i` is equal to `h` or if `i` is not greater than `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `z` is not 1, then `ans1` is 1 if `i` is equal to `h` or if `i` is not greater than `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
