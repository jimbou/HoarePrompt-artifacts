Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `p` is `j+1`, `i` is the first element of `s`, and the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`. If the first element of `s` is greater than the last element of `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. Otherwise, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.**
