Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 2, `p` is `j+1`, `i` is the next element in `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of the original `s`, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.**
