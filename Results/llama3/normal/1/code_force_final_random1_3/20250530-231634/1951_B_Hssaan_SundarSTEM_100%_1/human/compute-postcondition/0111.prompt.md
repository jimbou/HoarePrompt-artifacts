Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index k - 1, then swapped with the element at index j, then swapped with the element at index k - 1 again, h is the first element of s, j is the length of s minus 1, i is the last element of s, p is the length of s, ans is either the number of elements in s minus 1 that are greater than or equal to h if h is less than i, or the length of s minus 1 if h is not less than i, ans1 is 0, z is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the length of `s`, `ans` is either the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are greater than or equal to `h` if `h` is less than the last element of `s`, or the length of `s` minus 1 if `h` is not less than the last element of `s`. If the first element of `s` is equal to `h`, then `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 0, and `z` is 1. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the length of `s`, `ans` is either the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are greater than or equal to `h` if `h` is less than the last element of `s`, or the length of `s` minus 1 if `h` is not less than the last element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `i` is equal to the second element of `s`, `ans1` is 1, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `i` is not equal to the second element of `s`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is not greater than `h`, and `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the length of `s`, `ans` is either the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are greater than or equal to `h` if `h` is less than the last element of `s`, or the length of `s` minus 1 if `h` is not less than the last element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `i` is equal to the second element of `s`, `ans1` is 1, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `i` is not equal to the second element of `s`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is not greater than `h`, and `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, or 2 if `z` is 1 and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 0 or 1 respectively. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 2 if `i` is equal to `h` or if `i` is not greater than `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `z` is not 1, then `ans1` is 1 if `i` is equal to `h` or if `i` is not greater than `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
