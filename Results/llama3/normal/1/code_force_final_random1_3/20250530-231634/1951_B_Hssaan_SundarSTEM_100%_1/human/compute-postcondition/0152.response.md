Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `p` is `j+1`, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged. If the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of the original `s`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
