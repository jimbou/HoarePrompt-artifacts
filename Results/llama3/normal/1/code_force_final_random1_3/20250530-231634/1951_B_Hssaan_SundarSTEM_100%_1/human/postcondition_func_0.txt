This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers (n and k) and the second line contains n distinct integers representing cow strengths. For each test case, it swaps the first and k-th cow strengths, then calculates the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by the k-th cow when placed at the beginning and when placed at a position that maximizes the number of cows it can defeat. It prints the maximum of these two values for each test case.
