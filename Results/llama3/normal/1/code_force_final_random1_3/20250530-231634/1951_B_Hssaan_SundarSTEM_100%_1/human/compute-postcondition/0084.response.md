Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 1, `i` is the first element of `s`, `p` is the length of `s`, `ans` is either the number of elements in `s` minus 1 that are greater than or equal to `h` if `h` is less than the last element of `s`, or the length of `s` minus 1 if `h` is not less than the last element of `s`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0, and `i` is not equal to `h`***
