Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `stdin` is empty. If the value of the first element in `s` is less than the second element in `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.***
