Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers: n and k, where n is the number of cows (2 <= n <= 10^5) and k is the index of the cow (1 <= k <= n). The second line contains n space-separated integers: the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), which are all distinct.**
