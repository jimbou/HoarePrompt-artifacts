To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `s` starting from the second element (`s[1:]`). For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least two elements. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k` - 1, `ans` is 0, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is -1, `i` is the second element of `s`, and `stdin` contains no input.**
