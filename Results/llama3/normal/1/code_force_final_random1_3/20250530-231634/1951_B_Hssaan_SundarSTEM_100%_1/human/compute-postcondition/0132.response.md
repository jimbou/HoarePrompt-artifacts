Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `h` is the k-1th element of the original `s`, `j` is 3, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, `i` is the fourth element of the list. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.***
