Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, and then the element at index `j + 1` swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` must have at least one element, and `i` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. Otherwise, `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.***
