Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `h` is the k-1th element of the original `s`, `j` is 3, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, `i` is the fourth element of the list**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
