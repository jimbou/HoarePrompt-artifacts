Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k` - 1, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is 1, `i` is the third element of `s`, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values since the break statement does not affect the values of the variables. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
