Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, and then the element at index `j + 1` swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 3, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:-1]` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is the length of `s` minus 2, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
