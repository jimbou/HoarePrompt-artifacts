Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k` - 1, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `h` is greater than or equal to `i` and `ans` is 1.***
