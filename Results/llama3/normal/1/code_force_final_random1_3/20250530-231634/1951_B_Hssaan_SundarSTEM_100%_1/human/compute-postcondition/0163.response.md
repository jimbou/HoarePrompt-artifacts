Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 2, `p` is `j+1`, `i` is the next element in `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `j`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
