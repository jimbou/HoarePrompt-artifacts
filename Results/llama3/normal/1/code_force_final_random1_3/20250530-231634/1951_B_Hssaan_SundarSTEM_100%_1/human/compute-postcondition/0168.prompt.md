Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the first element is the k-1th element of the original s, the k-1th element is the last element of the original s, and the j+1th element is the k-1th element of the original s, h is the last element of the original s, j is the number of elements in s minus 1, p is j+1, ans1 is 0, z is 0, i is the last element of the list, ans is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `p` is `j+1`. If the first element of `s` is equal to the last element of the original `s`, then `ans1` is 0 and `z` is 1. If the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of the original `s`, then if the first element of `s` is greater than the last element of `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `z` is not 1, then `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 1, `p` is `j+1`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of the original `s`, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `h` is the last element of the original `s`, `j` is the number of elements in `s` minus 2, `p` is `j+1`, `i` is the next element in `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of the original `s`, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
