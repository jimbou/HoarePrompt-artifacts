Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is 0 or 1, `i` is the third element in the list `s`, `j` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `stdin`, `ans`, `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `j` is increased by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
