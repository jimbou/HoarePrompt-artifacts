Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with the first element swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, and then the element at index `j + 1` swapped with the element at index `k - 1`, `j` is the length of `s` minus 3, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:-1]` that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is the length of `s` minus 2, `z` is 1, `i` is the second element of `s`, and `ans1` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `z`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `ans1` is incremented by 1.
