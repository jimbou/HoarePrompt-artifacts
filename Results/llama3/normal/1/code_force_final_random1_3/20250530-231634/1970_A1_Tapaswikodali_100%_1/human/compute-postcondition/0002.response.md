Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, `balance` is 0, `i` is 0**

The code appends a new element to the `balance_info` list, which is an instance of the `BalanceInfo` class, containing the current balance, index `i`, and the character at index `i` in the string `s`. The values of `s`, `n`, `balance`, and `i` remain unchanged.
