To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1 (since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`), and `n` is equal to the length of `s`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since `n` is equal to the length of `s`, which is not exceeding 500,000, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1.

The state of `s` and `balance_info` does not affect the loop condition, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1, `balance_info` is a list containing two elements. If `s[i]` is "(", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 1, 1, s[1])` and the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance, 2, s[2])`. If `s[i]` is ")", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance-1, 1, s[1])` and the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance, 2, s[2])`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**
