Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1, `balance_info` is a list containing three elements. If `s[i]` is "(", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 1, 1, s[1])`, the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance, 2, s[2])`, and the third element is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`. If `s[i]` is ")", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance-1, 1, s[1])`, the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance, 2, s[2])`, and the third element is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**

In this output state, the value of `balance_info` has been updated to include a new element `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, where `balance` is the current balance, `i` is the current index, and `s[i]` is the current character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
