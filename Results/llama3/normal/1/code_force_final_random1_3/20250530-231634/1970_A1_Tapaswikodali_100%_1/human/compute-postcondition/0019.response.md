Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, and `balance` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the integer `n` remains equal to the length of `s`, the list `balance_info` contains `n` elements, each representing the balance information at each index `i` of the string `s`, and the balance is reset to 0, indicating that the parentheses sequence is balanced.
