Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the sorting of the balance_info list. The problem statement specifies that the columns of the table should be sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position. However, the program sorts the list in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position, but it does not consider the original order of the characters when the prefix balance is the same.

For example, consider the input "(()(()))". The correct balanced shuffle should be "(()(()))", but the program will output "(()(()))" which is incorrect.

The correct implementation should sort the balance_info list in increasing order of prefix balance, and when the prefix balance is the same, it should sort in decreasing order of position, and then in the original order of the characters. 

Here is the correct implementation:

```
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position, x.original_order))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)
```

In this corrected implementation, we added an `original_order` attribute to the `BalanceInfo` class to keep track of the original order of the characters. We then modified the sorting key to include the `original_order` attribute, so that when the prefix balance is the same, the characters are sorted in the original order.
