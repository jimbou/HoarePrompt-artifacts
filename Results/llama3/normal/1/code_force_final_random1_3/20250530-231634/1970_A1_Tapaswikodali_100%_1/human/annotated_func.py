#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects of a class with two attributes: balance and position, where balance is an integer and position is a non-negative integer.
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and infoB, where both balances are integers and not equal to each other.
    #State: *infoA and infoB are objects of a class with two attributes: balance and position, where balance is an integer and position is a non-negative integer. infoA.balance equals infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the positions of infoB and infoA, where both infoA and infoB have the same balance and their positions are non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two objects, infoA and infoB, based on their balance and position attributes. If the balances are not equal, it returns the difference between the balances. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the positions of infoB and infoA.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
    n = len(s)

    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, and `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string consisting of the characters from s in the order of their balance and position, with a length of at most 500,000

#Overall this is what the function does:Reorders a balanced parentheses sequence to prioritize characters with lower balance and earlier position, and prints the resulting string.
