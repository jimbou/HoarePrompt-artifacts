Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, n is an integer equal to the length of s, balance_info is an empty list, balance is 0**

In this output state, the initial state of `s` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The variable `n` is assigned the length of `s`, which is an integer not exceeding 500,000. The list `balance_info` is initialized as an empty list, and the variable `balance` is set to 0.
