Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `balance_info` is a list containing two elements. The first element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 1, 1, s[1])`. If `s[1]` is "(", then `balance` is 2,  `i` is 1, and `s[1]` is the second character in `s`. If `s[1]` is ")", then `balance` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s[1]` is the second character in `s`. The second element is `BalanceInfo(balance, 2, s[2])`. If `s[2]` is "(", then `balance` is 1, `i` is 2, and `s[2]` is the third character in `s`. If `s[2]` is ")", then `balance` is -1, `i` is 2, and `s[2]` is the third character in `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` in the first element of `balance_info` has been incremented by 1. If `s[1]` is "(", then `balance` is now 2, otherwise it is 0. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as well as the second element of `balance_info`.
