Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, n is an integer equal to the length of s, balance_info is an empty list, balance is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
    if s[i] == '(':
        balance += 1
    else:
        balance -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`. If `s[i]` is "(", then `balance` is 1, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is "(". If `s[i]` is ")", then `balance` is -1, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is ")".

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `balance_info` is a list containing two elements. If `s[i]` is "(", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 1, 1, s[1])` and the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance, 2, s[2])`. If `s[i]` is ")", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance-1, 1, s[1])` and the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance, 2, s[2])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1, `balance_info` is a list containing three elements. If `s[i]` is "(", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 2, 1, s[1])`, the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 1, 2, s[2])`, and the third element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 1, i, s[i])`, and `balance` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is ")", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance-2, 1, s[1])`, the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance-1, 2, s[2])`, and the third element is `BalanceInfo(balance-1, i, s[i])`, and `balance` is decreased by 1. In both cases, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
