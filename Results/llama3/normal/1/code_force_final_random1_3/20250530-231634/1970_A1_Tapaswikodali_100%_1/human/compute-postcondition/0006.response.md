Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, `balance` is -1, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is ")"**

The code decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` is 0, it becomes -1 after the execution of the code. The other variables remain unchanged.
