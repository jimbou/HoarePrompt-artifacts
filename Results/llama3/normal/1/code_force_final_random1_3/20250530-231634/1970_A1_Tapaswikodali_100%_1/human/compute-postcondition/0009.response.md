To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 (since `i` is the index of the first character in the string `s`), and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `balance_info` is a list containing one element which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`. If `s[i]` is "(", then `balance` is 1, `i` is 1, and `s[i]` is the second character in `s`. If `s[i]` is ")", then `balance` is -1, `i` is 1, and `s[i]` is the second character in `s`.**
