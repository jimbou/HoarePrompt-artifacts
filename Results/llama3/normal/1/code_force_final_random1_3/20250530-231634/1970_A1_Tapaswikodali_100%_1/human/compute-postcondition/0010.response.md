Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `balance_info` is a list containing two elements. The first element is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`. If `s[i]` is "(", then `balance` is 1, `i` is 1, and `s[i]` is the second character in `s`. If `s[i]` is ")", then `balance` is -1, `i` is 1, and `s[i]` is the second character in `s`. The second element is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`. If `s[i]` is "(", then `balance` is 1, `i` is 2, and `s[i]` is the third character in `s`. If `s[i]` is ")", then `balance` is -1, `i` is 2, and `s[i]` is the third character in `s`.**

In this output state, the string `s` and the integer `n` remain unchanged. The list `balance_info` now contains two elements, where the first element is the same as before, and the second element is a new `BalanceInfo` object with `i` incremented to 2 and `s[i]` being the third character in `s`. The `balance` value in the second element depends on whether the third character in `s` is "(" or ")".
