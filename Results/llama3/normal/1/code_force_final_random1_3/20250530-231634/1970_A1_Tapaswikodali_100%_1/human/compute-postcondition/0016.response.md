Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1, `balance_info` is a list containing three elements. If `s[i]` is "(", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 2, 1, s[1])`, the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 1, 2, s[2])`, and the third element is `BalanceInfo(balance + 1, i, s[i])`. If `s[i]` is ")", then the first element is `BalanceInfo(balance, 1, s[1])`, the second element is `BalanceInfo(balance - 1, 2, s[2])`, and the third element is `BalanceInfo(balance - 1, i, s[i])`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `balance` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains the same, the length of `s` is still `n`, and `n` is still greater than `i` plus 1. The `balance_info` list is updated to reflect the new balance value, which is increased by 1. The `i` value is also incremented by 1.
