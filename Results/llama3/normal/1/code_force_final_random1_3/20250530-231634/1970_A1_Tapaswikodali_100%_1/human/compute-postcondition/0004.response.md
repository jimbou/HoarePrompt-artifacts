Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, `balance` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is "("**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains the same, the length of `s` (which is `n`) is still greater than 0, and the balance information list still contains one element. However, the balance value has increased by 1 and is now 1, the index `i` remains 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is still "("
