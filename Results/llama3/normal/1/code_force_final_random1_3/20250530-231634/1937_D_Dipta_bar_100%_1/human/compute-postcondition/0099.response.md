Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is larger than `r`, `r` is the second last element of `B` and is not equal to 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `a` is the value of the second last element of `B`, `b` is the value of the second last element of `A` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `b` has been updated by adding the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `(r + 1)` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
