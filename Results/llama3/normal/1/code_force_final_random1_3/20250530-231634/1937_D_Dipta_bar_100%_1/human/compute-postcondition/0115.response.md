Output State: **i is 1, n is at least 2, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `a` and `b` based on the values of `B`, `idx_B`, `A`, `l`, `r`, and `i`. The new values of `a` and `b` are calculated using the provided formulas, which take into account the previous values of these variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
