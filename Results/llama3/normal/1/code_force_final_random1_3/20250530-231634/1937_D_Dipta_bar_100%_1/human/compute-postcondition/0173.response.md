Postcondition: ***`s[i]` is '>', `l` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, the value of `i+1` which is equal to `[i+1]` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus (`i` - `idx_A[l - 1]`) times `l`, `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus (`idx_B[r - l]` - `i`) times (`r` - `l`) plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) times `l` if `r` - `l` >= 0. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r]` plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) times `l`, and 2 times `a` plus 2 times `b` plus `i` plus 1 is printed.***
