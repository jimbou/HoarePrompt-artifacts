The code `i = n - 1 - j` updates the value of `i`. Since `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, and `j` is 1, the new value of `i` is `n - 1 - 1`, which is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`, and if `s[n-1]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element which is `n-1`, and `B` is a list containing the updated value of x. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.**
