Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the cumulative sum of products of differences between indices of '<' and '>' characters at each position, considering both forward and backward directions. It handles cases where the indices of '<' and '>' characters are at the boundaries of the string and prints the results for each position in the string.

The program uses two lists `A` and `B` to store the cumulative sums, which is an efficient approach to solve the problem. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, which is acceptable for the given constraints.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
