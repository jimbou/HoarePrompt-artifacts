Functionality: **The function takes a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters as input and prints the cumulative sum of products of differences between indices of '<' and '>' characters at each position, considering both forward and backward directions. It calculates the cumulative sum by iterating through the string twice, first from left to right and then from right to left, and uses two lists `A` and `B` to store the cumulative sums. The function prints the results for each position in the string, handling cases where the indices of '<' and '>' characters are at the boundaries of the string.**
