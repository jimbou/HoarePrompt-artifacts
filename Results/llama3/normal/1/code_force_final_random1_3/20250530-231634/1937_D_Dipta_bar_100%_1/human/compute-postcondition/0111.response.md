Output: **(2 * A[l]) + 2 * (B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)) + i + 1 (where A[l] is the value of a, B[r - 1] is the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, idx_B[x] is the index of '<' character at index x, idx_B[r - 1] is the index of '<' character at index r - 1, i is 1, x is r - (l + 2), and l is the index of A)**
