Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is '>'. If the length of `idx_A` is 0, then `A` is a list containing a single element 0, and `idx_A` is an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A), and `idx_A` is a list and is not empty.***
