Output State: **i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is larger than r, r is the second last element of B and is not equal to 0, the character at index i in string s is not '>', a is the value of the second last element of B, and b is the value of the second last element of A.**

The code snippet assigns the value of the second last element of `B` to `a` and the value of the second last element of `A` to `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The character at index `i` in string `s` is still not '>'. The new variables `a` and `b` are introduced with specific values based on the existing arrays `B` and `A`.
