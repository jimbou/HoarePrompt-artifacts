Output State: **j is n, i is -1, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is 0, r is the length of B**

In this final state, the variable `l` has been assigned the value 0, and the variable `r` has been assigned the length of the list `B`. The values of `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, and `B` remain unchanged from the initial state, as they were not modified by the code snippet.
