Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element which is `n-1` if `s[n-1]` is '<', otherwise it remains unchanged and also contains the value `n-2`, and `B` is a list containing the updated value of x with an additional element 0 appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is still 2. The list `A` and `idx_A` also remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `n - 3`. The list `idx_B` contains at least one element which is `n-1` if `s[n-1]` is '<', otherwise it remains unchanged and also contains the value `n-2`. The list `B` now contains an additional element 0 appended to it.
