Output State: **i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is equal to r, r is the length of B and is larger than 0, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1].**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign values to new variables `a` and `b`. The first line calculates the value of `a` by adding the last element of `B` (which is the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration) to the product of the difference between the last index in `idx_B` and the current index `i`, multiplied by the length of `B` (which is `r`). The second line assigns the last element of `A` (which is not defined in the initial state) to `b`. 

Since `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is equal to `r`, and `r` is the length of `B` and is larger than 0, these variables remain unchanged. The current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>' remains valid as well.
