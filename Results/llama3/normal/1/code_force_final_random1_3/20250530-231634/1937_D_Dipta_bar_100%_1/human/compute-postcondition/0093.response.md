Output: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is larger than `r`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', the current value of `r` is 0, and this is printed: the value of `n` minus the value of `i` plus the product of the difference between the value of `i` and the value at index `l-1` in `idx_A` and 2**
