Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is the length of s and is at least 2, j is 1, A is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of idx_A at each iteration, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, i is n - 2, idx_B is a list containing at least one element which is n-1, and B is a list containing the updated value of x which is B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B).**

In this output state, the value of x is updated based on the last element of B, the last element of idx_B, the value of i, and the length of idx_B. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
