Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is `b - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being the update of the value of `b`. The value of `b` is now increased by the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
