Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx_A` has been appended with the value 2, If `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list with an additional element 0. Otherwise, `A` has been appended with a new element `x`, which is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of (`i` - `idx_A`'s last element) and the length of `idx_A` before appending 2 to it.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of '<' and '>' characters, and the value of `n` remains greater than 2. The value of `i` is still 2. The list `idx_A` now contains the value 2. If `idx_A` was initially empty, the list `A` now has an additional element 0. If `idx_A` was not empty, the list `A` has been appended with a new element `x`, which is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of (`i` - `idx_A`'s last element) and the length of `idx_A` before appending 2 to it.
