Postcondition: ***i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is larger than r, r is the second last element of B and is not equal to 0, the character at index i in string s is not '>', a is the value of the second last element of B, and b is the value of the second last element of A. The current value of (l - r - 1) is greater than 0***
