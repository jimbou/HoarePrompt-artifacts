Output: **`s[i]` is '>', `l` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is `A[l]`, if `r - (l + 2)` is greater or equal to 0, then `x` is `r - (l + 2)` and `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, `x` is not changed and `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` (where `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is either `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` or `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` depending on whether `r - (l + 2)` is greater or equal to 0, and `i` is the current value of `i` increased by 1)**
