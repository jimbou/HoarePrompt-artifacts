Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of idx_A at each iteration, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and if `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element which is `n-1`, and `B` is a list containing the updated value of x. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element which is `n-1` if `s[n-1]` is '<', otherwise it remains unchanged and also contains the value `n-2`, and `B` is a list containing the updated value of x. If `idx_B` is empty, an additional element 0 is appended to `B`. Otherwise, the updated value of x is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B). If `s[i]` is not '<', then no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 3`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element which is `n-1` if `s[n-1]` is '<', otherwise it remains unchanged and also contains the value `n-2`, and `B` is a list containing the updated value of x. If `idx_B` is empty, an additional element 0 is appended to `B`. Otherwise, the updated value of x is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B). If `s[i]` is not '<', then no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
