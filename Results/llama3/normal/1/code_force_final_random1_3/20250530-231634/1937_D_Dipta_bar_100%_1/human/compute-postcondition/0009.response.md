Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list containing the value 0, and `A` is a list containing a single element 0 if the length of `idx_A` was 0, otherwise `A` is a list with an additional element x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A). If `s[i]` is '<', the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
