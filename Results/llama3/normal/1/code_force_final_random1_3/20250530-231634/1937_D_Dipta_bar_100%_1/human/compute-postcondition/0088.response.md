Output: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is larger than 0. If `r - l` is larger or equal to 0, then `r` is updated to the second last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)`, and `b` is updated to the second last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)`. Otherwise, the values of `r` and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`**
