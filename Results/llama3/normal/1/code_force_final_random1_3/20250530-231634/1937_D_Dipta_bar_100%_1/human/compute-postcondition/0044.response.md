Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is the length of s and is at least 3, j is 2, A is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of idx_A at each iteration, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, i is n - 3, idx_B is a list containing at least one element which is n-1 if s[n-1] is '<', otherwise it remains unchanged and also contains the value n-2, B is a list containing the updated value of x. If idx_B is empty, an additional element 0 is appended to B. Otherwise, the updated value of x is B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B).**

The code block calculates the updated value of x and appends it to list B. If idx_B is empty, it appends 0 to B. Otherwise, it calculates the updated value of x by adding the difference between the last element of idx_B and i, multiplied by the length of idx_B, to the last element of B. The value of x is then appended to B. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
