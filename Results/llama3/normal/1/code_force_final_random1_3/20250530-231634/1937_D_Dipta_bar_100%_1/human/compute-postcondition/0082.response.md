Output State: **i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is larger than 0, r is the second last element of B, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, and b is the second last element of B.**

The code executes the following operations:

1. `a = A[l - 1]`: Assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `a`. Since `l` is larger than 0, `a` becomes the value of the element at index `l - 1` in the list `A`.

2. `a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`: Increments `a` by the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`. Since `i` is 0 and `idx_A[l - 1]` is an index in the list `A`, the value of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` is negative. Therefore, `a` is decremented by the product of the absolute value of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`.

3. `b = B[r]`: Assigns the value of `B[r]` to `b`. Since `r` is the second last element of `B`, `b` becomes the second last element of `B`.

The final state includes the initial values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, and `r`, as well as the updated values of `a` and `b`. The character at index `i` in string `s` is still not '>'.
