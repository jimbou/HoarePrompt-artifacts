Output State: **i is n, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is n, r is 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` has reached the value of `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. The variable `j` remains unchanged and still has the value of `n`. The list `idx_B` still contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order. The list `B` still contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration. The variable `l` has been incremented to the value of `n`, and the variable `r` has been decremented to 0.
