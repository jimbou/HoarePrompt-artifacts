Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` is `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by adding the product of the difference between the index of the '<' character at position `r` in `idx_B` and the value of `i`, and the value of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
