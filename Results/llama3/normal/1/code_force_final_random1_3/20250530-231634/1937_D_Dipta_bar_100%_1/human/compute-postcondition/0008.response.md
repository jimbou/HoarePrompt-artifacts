Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing the value 0, `A` is a list containing a single element 0 if the length of `idx_A` was 0, otherwise `A` is a list with an additional element x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A).**

In this output state, the value of `idx_A` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 0. The value of `A` has also been updated based on the length of `idx_A`. If `idx_A` was initially empty, `A` now contains a single element 0. Otherwise, `A` has an additional element x, which is calculated based on the previous values of `A` and `idx_A`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
