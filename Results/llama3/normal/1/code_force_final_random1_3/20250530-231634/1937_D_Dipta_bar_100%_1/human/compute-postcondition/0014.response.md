Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` contains an additional element `i`, which is 1, If `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list containing one element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, which is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is still greater than 1. The value of `i` remains 1. The list `idx_A` now contains an additional element, which is the current value of `i`, i.e., 1. If `idx_A` was initially empty, the list `A` still contains only one element, which is 0. However, if `idx_A` was not empty, the list `A` now contains an additional element `x`, which is calculated based on the last element of `A`, the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`.
