Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is the length of s and is at least 1, j is 0, A is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of idx_A at each iteration, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, B is a list containing the updated value of x, idx_B is a list containing at least one element, i is equal to n-1, and the current value of s[i] is '<'.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `x` by adding the last element of list `B` to the product of the difference between the last element of list `idx_B` and `i`, and the length of list `idx_B`. This calculated value of `x` is then appended to list `B`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
