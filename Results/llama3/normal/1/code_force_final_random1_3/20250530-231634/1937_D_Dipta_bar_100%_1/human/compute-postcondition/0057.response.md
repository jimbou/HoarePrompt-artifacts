Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is the length of `B`, `a` is `A[l]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, which is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)` since `i` is 0, and since `r - (l + 2)` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` is updated by adding the product of the difference between the index of the last '<' character in `idx_B` and the current value of `i` (which is 0), and the value of `l` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
