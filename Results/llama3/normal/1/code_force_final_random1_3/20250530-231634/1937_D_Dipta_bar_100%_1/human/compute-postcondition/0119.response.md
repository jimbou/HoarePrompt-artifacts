Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is also equal to `b - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `b` is updated by adding the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `r`. Additionally, if `l - r > 0`, `b` is also equal to its previous value minus `A[l - r - 1]` and the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 1]` and `l - r`.
