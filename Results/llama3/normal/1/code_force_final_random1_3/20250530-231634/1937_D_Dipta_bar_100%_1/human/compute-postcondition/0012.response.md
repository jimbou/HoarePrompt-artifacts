Output State: **A is a list with an additional element x, which is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between i and the last element of idx_A, and the length of idx_A, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 1, i is 1**

In this output state, the list A has been modified by appending a new element x, which is calculated based on the last element of A, the difference between i and the last element of idx_A, and the length of idx_A. The string s, the value of n, and the value of i remain unchanged.
