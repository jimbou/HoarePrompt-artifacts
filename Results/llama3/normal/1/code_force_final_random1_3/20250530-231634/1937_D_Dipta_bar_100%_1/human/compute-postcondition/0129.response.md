Output State: **i is 1, n is at least 2, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l).**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The only variable affected is `b`, which is updated in two steps. First, `b` is decremented by the value of `B[r - l]`, and then it is further decremented by the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)`. The resulting value of `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.
