The code prints the value of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is the value of the second last element of `B`, `b` is the value of the second last element of `A` minus the value of `A[l - r - 2]` minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and the value of `l - r - 1` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `n` is at least 2.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is the value of the second last element of B, b is the value of the second last element of A minus the value of A[l - r - 2] minus the product of the difference between idx_A[l - 1] and idx_A[l - r - 2] and the value of l - r - 1 plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), and n is at least 2)**
