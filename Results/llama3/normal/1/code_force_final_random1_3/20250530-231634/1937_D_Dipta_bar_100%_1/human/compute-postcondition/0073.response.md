Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration. If `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1)`, and `A[l] * 2 + b * 2 + (idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1) * 2 + 1` is printed. If `l` is equal to `r`, the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>'. If the length of `B` is 0, `n` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l` is larger than `r`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `2 * a + 2 * b + n - i` is printed.**
