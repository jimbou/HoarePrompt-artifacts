Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 3`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element which is `n-1` if `s[n-1]` is '<', otherwise it remains unchanged and also contains the value `n-2`, and `B` is a list containing the updated value of x. If `idx_B` is empty, an additional element 0 is appended to `B`. Otherwise, the updated value of x is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B). If `s[i]` is not '<', then no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to `n - 3` due to the execution of the code `i = n - 1 - j`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `idx_B` and `B` still apply based on the value of `s[i]`.
