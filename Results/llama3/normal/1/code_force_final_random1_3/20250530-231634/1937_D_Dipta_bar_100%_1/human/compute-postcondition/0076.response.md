Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is 0, `r` is the second last element of `B`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>'**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to the second last element of `B`, which is one less than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
