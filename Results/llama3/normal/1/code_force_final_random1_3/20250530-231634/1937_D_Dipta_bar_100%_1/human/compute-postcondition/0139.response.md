Postcondition: **i is 1, n is at least 2, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, a is the value of the second last element of B, if l - r - 1 > 0, then b is the value of the second last element of A minus the value of A[l - r - 2] and minus the product of the difference between idx_A[l - 1] and idx_A[l - r - 2] and the value of l - r - 1, otherwise, b is the value of the second last element of A, l is increased by 1 if s[i] is '>', r is updated if l is less than or equal to r, and the values of r and b are updated accordingly, and the value of a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 or n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 is printed.**
