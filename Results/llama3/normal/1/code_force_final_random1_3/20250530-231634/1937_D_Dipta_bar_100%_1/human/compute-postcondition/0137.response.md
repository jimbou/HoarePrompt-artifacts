Output State: **i is 1, n is at least 2, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, a is the value of the second last element of B, b is the value of the second last element of A, l is increased by 1 if s[i] is '>', r is updated if l is less than or equal to r, and the values of r and b are updated accordingly, and the value of a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 or n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 is printed.**

The code snippet provided modifies the values of `a`, `b`, `l`, `r`, and prints a value based on the conditions specified. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 1. The value of `n` is at least 2 and remains unchanged. The value of `j` is `n` and remains unchanged. The values of `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `a` is updated to the value of the second last element of `B`. The value of `b` is updated to the value of the second last element of `A`. The value of `l` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '>'. The value of `r` is updated if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. The values of `r` and `b` are updated accordingly based on the conditions specified. Finally, the value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` or `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is printed.
