Output State: **`s[i]` is '>', `l` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by adding the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `r` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `l - r > 0` and the value of `a` are still valid.
