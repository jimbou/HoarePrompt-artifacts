Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element which is `n-1` if `s[n-1]` is '<', otherwise it remains unchanged and also contains the value `n-2`. If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list containing an additional element 0. Otherwise, `B` is a list containing the updated value of x, which is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B).***
