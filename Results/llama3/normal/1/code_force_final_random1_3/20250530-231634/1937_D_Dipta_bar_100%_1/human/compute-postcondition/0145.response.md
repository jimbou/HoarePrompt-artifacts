Postcondition: **The program executes the if-else block based on the condition `s[i] == '>'`. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. If `s[i]` is not '>', then the program checks the values of `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i+1` is printed. If `l` is larger than 0, then if `r - l` is larger or equal to 0, `r` and `b` are updated accordingly, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and the value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed. If `l` is larger than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n` minus the value of `i` plus the product of the difference between the value of `i` and the value at index `l-1` in `idx_A` and 2 is printed. If `r` is not 0, `a` and `b` are updated accordingly, and the value of `2 * a + 2 * b + n - i` is printed. Finally, `r` is decreased by 1, and if `l` is 0, then `i + 1` is printed. Otherwise, `a` and `b` are updated accordingly, and the value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed.**
