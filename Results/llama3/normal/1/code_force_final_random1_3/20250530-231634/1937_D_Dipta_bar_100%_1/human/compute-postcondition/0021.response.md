Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` has been appended with the value 2, and if `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list with an additional element 0. Otherwise, `A` has been appended with a new element `x`, which is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of (`i` - `idx_A`'s last element) and the length of `idx_A` before appending 2 to it.***
