Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a grid based on the direction of arrows at each cell. The program uses two lists, A and B, to store the cumulative sum of products of differences between indices of '<' and '>' characters at each position, considering both forward and backward directions.

The program first initializes the lists A and B by iterating through the string s from left to right and right to left, respectively. It then calculates the cumulative sum of products of differences between indices of '<' and '>' characters at each position by iterating through the string again and using the values stored in lists A and B.

The program handles cases where the indices of '<' and '>' characters are at the boundaries of the string by checking the values of l and r, which represent the current positions in lists A and B, respectively. If l is less than r, it means that the current position is within the range of list A, and the program calculates the cumulative sum accordingly. If r is equal to 0, it means that the current position is at the right boundary of the string, and the program calculates the cumulative sum based on the value of n, which is the length of the string.

The program also handles cases where the indices of '<' and '>' characters are at the boundaries of the string by checking the values of l and r. If l is equal to 0, it means that the current position is at the left boundary of the string, and the program calculates the cumulative sum based on the value of i, which is the current position in the string. If r is equal to 0, it means that the current position is at the right boundary of the string, and the program calculates the cumulative sum based on the value of n.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the cumulative sum of products of differences between indices of '<' and '>' characters at each position in the string, considering both forward and backward directions, and handles cases where the indices of '<' and '>' characters are at the boundaries of the string.

Correctness: **True**
