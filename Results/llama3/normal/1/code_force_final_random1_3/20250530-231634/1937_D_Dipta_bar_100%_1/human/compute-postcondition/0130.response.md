Postcondition: **i is 1, n is at least 2, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l. If r - l >= 0, b is B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l). Otherwise, b is B[r].**
