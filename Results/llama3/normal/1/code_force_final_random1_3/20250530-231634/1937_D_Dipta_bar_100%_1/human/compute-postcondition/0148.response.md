Output State: **s[i] is '>', l is increased by 1, i is increased by 1, n is greater than i, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), b is B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)**

The code modifies the value of `b` in two steps. First, it subtracts the value of `B[x]` from `b`, and then it subtracts the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)` from the result. The final value of `b` is the result of these two subtractions. All other variables remain unchanged.
