Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is increased by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
