To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0. Additionally, since the loop starts from 0, we can set `i` to 0.

The other variables `s`, `A`, and `idx_A` are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
