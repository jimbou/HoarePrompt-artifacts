To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is the length of string `s`, we can infer that `s` must have at least 1 character for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of idx_A at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list**
