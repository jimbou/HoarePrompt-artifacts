Postcondition: ***i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, r is the length of B and is larger than 0, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1]. If l is larger than r, then b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r).***
