The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and if `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element which is `n-1`, and `B` is a list containing the updated value of x. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.**
