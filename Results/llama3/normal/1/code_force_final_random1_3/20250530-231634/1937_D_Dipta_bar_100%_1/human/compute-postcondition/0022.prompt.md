Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if len(idx_A) == 0:
            A.append(0)
        else:
            x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
            A.append(x)
        idx_A.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list containing the value 0, and `A` is a list containing a single element 0 if the length of `idx_A` was 0, otherwise `A` is a list with an additional element x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A). If `s[i]` is '<', the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` contains an additional element `i`, which is 1. If `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list containing one element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, which is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` has been appended with the value 2, and if `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list with an additional element 0. Otherwise, `A` has been appended with a new element `x`, which is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of (`i` - `idx_A`'s last element) and the length of `idx_A` before appending 2 to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
