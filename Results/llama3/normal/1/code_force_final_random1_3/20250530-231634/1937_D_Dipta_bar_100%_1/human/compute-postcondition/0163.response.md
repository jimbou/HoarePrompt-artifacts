Output State: **`s[i]` is '>', `l` is increased by 2, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is `A[l + 1]`, and if `r - (l + 3)` is greater or equal to 0, then `x` is `r - (l + 3)` and `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 2)`. Otherwise, `x` is not changed and `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 2)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and `i` is printed, which is `n - i`. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` is increased by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions for printing the expressions are updated accordingly, taking into account the new value of `l`.
