Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `i` is 0, so `i + 1` will be 1.
* The `end` parameter in the `print` function is set to `' '`, which means that a space will be printed after the value of `i + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the value 1 followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
