The code prints the result of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, which can be broken down as follows:

*   `n` is at least 1, so `n - i` will be at least 1 because `i` is 0.
*   `i` is 0, so `i - idx_A[l - 1]` will be the negation of the value at index `l - 1` in the list `idx_A`.
*   Since `l` is larger than `r`, and `r` is 0, `l` is at least 1. Therefore, `l - 1` is at least 0, which means `idx_A[l - 1]` is a valid index in the list `idx_A`.
*   The value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not explicitly provided, but based on the context, it seems to be an index in the string `s`. Let's denote this value as `idx_A_l_minus_1`.
*   The expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` will be `-2 * idx_A_l_minus_1` because `i` is 0.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output the result of `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, which is `n + (-2 * idx_A_l_minus_1)`.

Output: **n + (-2 \* idx\_A\_l\_minus\_1) (where n is at least 1 and idx\_A\_l\_minus\_1 is the value at index l - 1 in the list idx\_A)**
