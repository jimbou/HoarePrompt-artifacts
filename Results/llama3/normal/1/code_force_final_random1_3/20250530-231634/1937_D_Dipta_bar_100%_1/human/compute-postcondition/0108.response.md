Postcondition: ***i is 1, n is at least 2, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), b is B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) if x >= 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
