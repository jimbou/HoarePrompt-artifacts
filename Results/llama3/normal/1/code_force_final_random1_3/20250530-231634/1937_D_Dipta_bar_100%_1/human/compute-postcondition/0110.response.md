Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`, otherwise `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 1, `n` is still at least 2, `j` is still equal to `n`, `idx_B` still contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` still contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `a` is still `A[l]`, `x` is still `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` has been updated to include the additional term `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, but only if `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
