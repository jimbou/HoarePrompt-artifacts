Postcondition: ***i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is less than r, r is the length of B, a is A[l], the current value of x is r - (l + 2) and is greater than or equal to 0, and b is B[r - 1].***
