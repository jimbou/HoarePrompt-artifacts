Output: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `a` is the value of the second last element of `B`, `b` is the value of the second last element of `A` minus the value of `A[l - r - 2]` minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and the value of `l - r - 1` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '>', `r` is updated if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the values of `r` and `b` are updated accordingly, and the value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed.**
