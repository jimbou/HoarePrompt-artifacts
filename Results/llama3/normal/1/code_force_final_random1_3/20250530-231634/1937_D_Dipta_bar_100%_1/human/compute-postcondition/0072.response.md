Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the length of `B`. The current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>'. If the length of `B` is 0, the difference between `n` and `i` which is equal to `n` is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l` is larger than `r`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, and this is printed: 2 * a + 2 * b + n - i.***
