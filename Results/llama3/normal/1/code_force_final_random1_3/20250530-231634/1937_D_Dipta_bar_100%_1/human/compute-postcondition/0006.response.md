Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, A is a list with an additional element x, idx_A is a list and is not empty, i is 0, and the current value of s[i] is '>', x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)**

The code block calculates the value of x based on the last element of list A, the current index i, the last element of list idx_A, and the length of idx_A. It then appends this value x to the end of list A. The value of x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A). The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
