Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list.**

The first line assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. The second and third lines initialize two empty lists, `A` and `idx_A`, respectively. Since `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', its length is a non-negative integer. The value of `n` is this length. The lists `A` and `idx_A` are empty, meaning they have no elements.
