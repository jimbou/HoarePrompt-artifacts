Output State: **i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is less than r, r is the length of B, a is A[l], and b is the updated value of b after the code execution.**

The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting the value of `B[x]` and then subtracting the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)`. The value of `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, which is greater than or equal to 0. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged.
