Output State: **i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is larger than r, r is the length of B and is larger than 0, the current value of l is larger than the current value of r, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting two values from it. The first line subtracts `A[l - r - 1]` from `b`, which is the value at index `l - r - 1` in the list `A`. The second line subtracts the product of `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1])` and `(l - r)` from `b`. The value of `idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]` represents the difference between the indices of two elements in the list `idx_A`, and `(l - r)` is the difference between the current value of `l` and `r`. The updated value of `b` is the result of these two subtractions. All other variables remain unchanged.
