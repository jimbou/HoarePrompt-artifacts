Output State: **i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is larger than 0, r is the second last element of B minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l), a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, and b is the second last element of B minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l).**

In this output state, the value of r has been updated to be the second last element of B minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l). The value of b has also been updated to be the second last element of B minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l). All other variables remain unchanged.
