Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: j is n, i is -1, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is 0, r is the length of B
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is not '>', then if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i+1` which is 1 is printed. If `l` is larger than 0, then if `r - l` is larger or equal to 0, `r` is updated to the second last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)`, and `b` is updated to the second last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)`. Otherwise, the values of `r` and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is larger than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n` minus the value of `i` plus the product of the difference between the value of `i` and the value at index `l-1` in `idx_A` and 2 is printed. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of the second last element of `B`, `b` is the value of the second last element of `A` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and 2 times the value of the second last element of `B` plus 2 times the value of the second last element of `A` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` plus `n` minus `i` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program executes the if-else block based on the condition `s[i] == '>'`. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. If `s[i]` is not '>', then the program checks the values of `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i+1` is printed. If `l` is larger than 0, then if `r - l` is larger or equal to 0, `r` and `b` are updated accordingly, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and the value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed. If `l` is larger than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n` minus the value of `i` plus the product of the difference between the value of `i` and the value at index `l-1` in `idx_A` and 2 is printed. If `r` is not 0, `a` and `b` are updated accordingly, and the value of `2 * a + 2 * b + n - i` is printed. Finally, `r` is decreased by 1, and if `l` is 0, then `i + 1` is printed. Otherwise, `a` and `b` are updated accordingly, and the value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s[i]` is '>', `l` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is `A[l + 1]`, and if `r - (l + 3)` is greater or equal to 0, then `x` is `r - (l + 3)` and `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 2)`. Otherwise, `x` is not changed and `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 2)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and `i` is printed, which is `n - i`. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is being printed. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i+1` which is equal to `[i+1]` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus (`i` - `idx_A[l - 1]`) times `l`, `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus (`idx_B[r - l]` - `i`) times (`r` - `l`) plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) times `l` if `r` - `l` >= 0. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r]` plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) times `l`, and 2 times `a` plus 2 times `b` plus `i` plus 1 is printed. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` equals 0, then the difference between `n` and `i` plus twice the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]`, which is equal to `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1` is greater than 0, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
