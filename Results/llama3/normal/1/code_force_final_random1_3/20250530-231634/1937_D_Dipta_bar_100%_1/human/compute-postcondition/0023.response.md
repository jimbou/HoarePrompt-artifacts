Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of idx_A at each iteration, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.**

The code snippet initializes two empty lists, B and idx_B, without modifying any existing variables. The initial state remains unchanged, with s being a string of '<' and '>' characters, n being its length, A being a list of cumulative sums, and idx_A being a list of indices of '>' characters. The introduction of B and idx_B does not affect the values of s, n, A, or idx_A.
