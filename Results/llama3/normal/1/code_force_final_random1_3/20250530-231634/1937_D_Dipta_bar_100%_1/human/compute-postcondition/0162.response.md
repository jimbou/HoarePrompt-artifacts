Postcondition: ***`s[i]` is '>', `l` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is `A[l]`, and if `r - (l + 2)` is greater or equal to 0, then `x` is `r - (l + 2)` and `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, `x` is not changed and `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and `i` is printed, which is `n - i`. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is being printed.***
