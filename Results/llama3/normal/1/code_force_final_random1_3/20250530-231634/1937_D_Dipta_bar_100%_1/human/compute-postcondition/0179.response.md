Output State: **s[i] is '>', l is increased by 1, i is increased by 1, n is greater than i, r is decreased by 1, a is B[r], b is b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1). If l - r - 1 > 0, then b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1). Otherwise, b is b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of s at index i is '>', l is increased by 1, i is increased by 1, n is still greater than i, r is decreased by 1, and a is still B[r]. The value of b is updated by adding the product of (i - idx_A[l - 1]) and (r + 1) to its previous value. If the difference between l and r is greater than 1, the value of b is a combination of the difference between A[l - 1] and A[l - r - 2], the difference between idx_A[l - 1] and idx_A[l - r - 2] multiplied by (l - r - 1), and the product of (i - idx_A[l - 1]) and (r + 1). Otherwise, the value of b is simply the previous value of b plus the product of (i - idx_A[l - 1]) and (r + 1).
