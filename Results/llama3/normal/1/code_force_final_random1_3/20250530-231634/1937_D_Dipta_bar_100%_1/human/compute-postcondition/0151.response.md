Output: **2 * A[l] + 2 * b + i + 1 (where A[l] is the element at index l in the list A, b is the value of b which is either B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) or b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) depending on whether r - (l + 2) is greater or equal to 0, and i is the value of i which is increased by 1)**
