Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'. If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `B` is a list containing the updated value of x and `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element.**
