The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. 

The value of `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, where `B[r - 1]` is the last element of the list `B` containing the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last index of '<' character in the string `s`, `i` is 0, and `r` is the length of `B` and is larger than 0.

The value of `b` depends on the value of `l`. If `l` is larger than `r`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, where `A[l - 1]` is the last element of the list `A` (the list `A` is not defined in the precondition), `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last index of '>' character in the string `s` (the list `idx_A` is not defined in the precondition), `i` is 0, and `r` is the length of `B` and is larger than 0. If `l` is not larger than `r`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

Since the exact values of `B[r - 1]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, `A[l - 1]`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r if l is larger than r, otherwise b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, and n is at least 1)**
