Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` may have changed, but the exact relationship depends on the initial values of `l` and `r`, which are not specified.
