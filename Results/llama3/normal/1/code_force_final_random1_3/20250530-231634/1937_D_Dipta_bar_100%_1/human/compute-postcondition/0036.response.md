Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx_B` is a list containing at least one element which is `n-1` if `s[n-1]` is '<', otherwise it remains unchanged, and `B` is a list containing the updated value of x with an additional element 0 appended to it.**

In this output state, the code has appended a new element 0 to the list `B`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `B` now contains an additional element 0, and all other variables maintain their previous values as specified in the initial state.
