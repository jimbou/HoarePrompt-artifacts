Postcondition: ***i is 1, n is at least 2, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r. If l - r > 0, b is b - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r).***
