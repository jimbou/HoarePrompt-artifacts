Postcondition: **`s[i]` is '>', `l` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` equals 0, then the difference between `n` and `i` plus twice the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]`, which is equal to `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1` is greater than 0, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and `i`.**
