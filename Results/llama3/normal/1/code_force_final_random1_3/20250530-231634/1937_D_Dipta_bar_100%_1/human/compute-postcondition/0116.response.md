Output State: **i is 1, n is at least 2, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is b - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` and `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from it. The initial value of `b` is `A[l - 1]`, and after the first line, it becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`. After the second line, it becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. No other variables are affected by the code.
