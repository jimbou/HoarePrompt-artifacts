Output: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is the length of `B`, `a` is `A[l]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` which is `A[l] * 2 + (b + (idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1)) * 2 + 0 + 1` which is `A[l] * 2 + b * 2 + (idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1) * 2 + 1`**
