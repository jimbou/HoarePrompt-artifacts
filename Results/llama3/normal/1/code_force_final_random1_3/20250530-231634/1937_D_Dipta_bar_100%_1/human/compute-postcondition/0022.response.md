Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, and `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, the list `A` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, and the list `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
