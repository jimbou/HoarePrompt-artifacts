To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `i` is -1, which is not a valid value for the loop to start. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

The state of `n` is not explicitly given, but we know that `j` is equal to `n`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1.

The other variables `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, and `r` are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`**
