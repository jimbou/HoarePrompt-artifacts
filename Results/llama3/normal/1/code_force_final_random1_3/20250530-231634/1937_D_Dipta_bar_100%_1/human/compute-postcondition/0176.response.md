Output State: **s[i] is '>', l is increased by 1, i is increased by 1, n is greater than i, r is decreased by 1, a is B[r], b is A[l - 1]**.

In this output state, the values of `s[i]`, `l`, `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state, as they are not modified by the code. The code only assigns new values to `a` and `b`, which are now equal to `B[r]` and `A[l - 1]`, respectively.
