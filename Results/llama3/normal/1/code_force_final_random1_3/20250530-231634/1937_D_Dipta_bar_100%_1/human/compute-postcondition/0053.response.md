Output State: **i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is less than r, r is the length of B, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), and b is B[r - 1].**

In this final state, the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `idx_B`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `l` is also unchanged, but it is now known to be less than `r`. The code introduces three new variables: `a`, `x`, and `b`. The value of `a` is set to `A[l]`, where `A` is an array and `l` is an index into that array. The value of `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`, which is a simple arithmetic expression. The value of `b` is set to `B[r - 1]`, where `B` is an array and `r - 1` is an index into that array.
