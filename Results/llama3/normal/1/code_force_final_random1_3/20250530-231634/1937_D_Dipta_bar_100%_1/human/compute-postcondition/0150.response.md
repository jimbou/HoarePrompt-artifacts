Output State: **`s[i]` is '>', `l` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `a` is `A[l]`, if `r - (l + 2)` is greater or equal to 0, then `x` is `r - (l + 2)` and `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, `x` is not changed and `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated based on the previous values of `idx_B[r - 1]`, `i`, and `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `r - (l + 2)` is still used to determine the values of `x` and `b`. If this condition is true, `x` and `b` have specific values based on the given expressions. If the condition is false, `x` remains unchanged, and `b` is updated with the new value.
