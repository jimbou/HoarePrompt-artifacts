Output State: **`s[i]` is '>', `l` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus (`i` - `idx_A[l - 1]`) times `l`, `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus (`idx_B[r - l]` - `i`) times (`r` - `l`) plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) times `l` if `r` - `l` >= 0. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r]` plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) times `l`.**

In this output state, the values of `s[i]`, `l`, `i`, `n`, `r`, and `a` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `b`, which is updated based on the given expression. The new value of `b` depends on whether `r` - `l` is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, then `b` is calculated as `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus (`idx_B[r - l]` - `i`) times (`r` - `l`) plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) times `l`. Otherwise, `b` is simply `B[r]` plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) times `l`.
