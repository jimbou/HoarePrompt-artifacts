Postcondition: **i is 0, n is at least 1, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, l is larger than 0, the current value of r is the second last element of B, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, and the current value of b is the second last element of B. Additionally, the difference between r and l is greater than or equal to 0.**
