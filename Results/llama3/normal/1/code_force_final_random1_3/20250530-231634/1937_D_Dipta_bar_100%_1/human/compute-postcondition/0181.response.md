Output: **s[i] is '>', l is increased by 1, i is increased by 1, n is greater than i, r is decreased by 1, a is B[r], b is b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1). If l - r - 1 > 0, then b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1). Otherwise, b is b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)., and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) where a is B[r], b is b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1) if l - r - 1 <= 0, otherwise b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), and n - i is the difference between n and i**
