Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of idx_A at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n-1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, and its length `n` is still at least 1. The value of `j` remains 0. The lists `A` and `idx_A` still contain the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, and the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, respectively. The lists `B` and `idx_B` are still empty. A new variable `i` is introduced, which is equal to `n-1`, since `j` is 0.
