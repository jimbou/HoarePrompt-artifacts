Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list containing a single element 0, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and the length of `idx_A` is 0**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `A` now contains a single element, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still consists of characters '<' and '>', `n` is still greater than 0, `idx_A` is still an empty list, `i` is still 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is still '>'. The length of `idx_A` is also still 0.
