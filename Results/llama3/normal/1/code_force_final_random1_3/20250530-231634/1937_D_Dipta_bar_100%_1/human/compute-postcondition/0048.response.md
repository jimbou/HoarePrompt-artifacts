Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the final state is reached. The variable `j` has reached the value `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. The variable `i` has reached the value `-1`, which is out of the bounds of the string `s`. The list `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order. The list `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has iterated over the entire string `s` from right to left, and has processed all the '<' characters. The list `idx_B` now contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string, and the list `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration. The loop has finished executing, and the final state is reached.
