Output State: **i is 1, n is at least 2, j is n, idx_B contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string s in reverse order, B contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of idx_B at each iteration, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r].**

The code snippet provided modifies the values of variables `a` and `b` based on the values of other variables and the string `s`. The value of `a` is updated to be the value of `A[l - 1]` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `l`. The value of `b` is updated to be the value of `B[r]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `idx_B`, and `B` remain unchanged.
