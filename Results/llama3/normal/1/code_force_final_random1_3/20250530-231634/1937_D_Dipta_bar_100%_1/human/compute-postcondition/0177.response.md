Output State: **s[i] is '>', l is increased by 1, i is increased by 1, n is greater than i, r is decreased by 1, a is B[r], b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)**

In this final state, the value of `b` has been updated based on the initial values of `A`, `idx_A`, `l`, and `r`. The expression `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]` calculates the difference between two elements in the array `A`, and the expression `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` calculates the product of the difference between two indices in the array `idx_A` and the difference between `l` and `r`. The result of these two expressions is subtracted from `b`, which was initially equal to `A[l - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
