Output State: **s[i] is '>', l is increased by 1, i is increased by 1, n is greater than i, r is decreased by 1, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, b is B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l)**

The code snippet modifies the value of variable `b`. The first line subtracts the value of `B[r - l]` from `b`, and the second line further subtracts the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` from `b`. The values of `s[i]`, `l`, `i`, `n`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged.
