The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s` in reverse order, `B` contains the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' characters and the length of `idx_B` at each iteration. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is not '>', then if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i+1` which is 1 is printed. If `l` is larger than 0, then if `r - l` is larger or equal to 0, `r` is updated to the second last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)`, and `b` is updated to the second last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)`. Otherwise, the values of `r` and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is larger than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n` minus the value of `i` plus the product of the difference between the value of `i` and the value at index `l-1` in `idx_A` and 2 is printed. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of the second last element of `B`, `b` is the value of the second last element of `A` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and 2 times the value of the second last element of `B` plus 2 times the value of the second last element of `A` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` plus `n` minus `i` is printed.**
