Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `A` is a list containing elements that represent the cumulative sum of the products of the differences between the indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A` at each iteration, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list containing 0, `idx_B` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `B` now contains a single element, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still consists of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, and its length `n` is still at least 1. The variable `j` is still 0, and the lists `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged. The list `idx_B` is still empty, and the variable `i` is still equal to `n-1`, with the current value of `s[i]` being '<'.
