The code prints the value of `i` increased by 1, followed by a space. Since `i` is increased by 1, its new value is used in the print statement. The `end=' '` argument in the print function is used to print a space after the value of `i + 1`.

Output: **[i + 1] (where i is the value of i after being increased by 1), followed by a space**
