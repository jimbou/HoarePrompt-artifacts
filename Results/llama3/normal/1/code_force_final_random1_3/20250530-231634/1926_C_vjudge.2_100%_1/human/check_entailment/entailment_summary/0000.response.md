Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5 in a list `pd`. This allows it to efficiently calculate the sum for each test case by simply looking up the precomputed value in the list.

The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number `n` and prints the corresponding cumulative sum from the `pd` list.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
