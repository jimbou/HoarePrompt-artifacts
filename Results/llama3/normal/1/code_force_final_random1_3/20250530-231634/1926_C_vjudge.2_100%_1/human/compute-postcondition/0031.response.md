Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is an integer between 200000 and 200000 inclusive and has at least 6 digits, `j` is the sixth digit of `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `pd[i]` has been increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` has been increased by `pd[i - 1]`, and `i` is an integer between 200000 and 200000 inclusive and has at least 6 digits.
