The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has at least 2 digits the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer between 100 and 9999 inclusive, `j` is the first digit of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `i` must have at least 2 digits and the `j` is the second digit of `i`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i` which is `2`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first digit of `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is an integer between 100 and 9999 inclusive and has at least 2 digits, `j` is the second digit of `i`.**
