Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i` which is `2`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first digit of `i`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second digit of `i`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the third digit of `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is an integer between 100 and 9999 inclusive and has at least 3 digits, `j` is the third digit of `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `pd[i]` has been increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i`, and `i` is an integer between 100 and 9999 inclusive and has at least 3 digits.
