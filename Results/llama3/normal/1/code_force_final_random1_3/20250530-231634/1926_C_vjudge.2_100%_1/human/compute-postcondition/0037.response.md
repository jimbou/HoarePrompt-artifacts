Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and stdin contains one input: an integer, and the value of `pd[n]` is being printed, which is the cumulative sum of the integer values of all characters in the strings from 1 to `n` and the cumulative sum of the previous values in the list `pd`**
