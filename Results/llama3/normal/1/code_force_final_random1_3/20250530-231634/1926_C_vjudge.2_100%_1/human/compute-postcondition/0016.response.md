Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of `j` which is the second character in the string `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character in the string `i`**

In this output state, the value of `pd[i]` has been increased by the integer value of `j`, which is the second character in the string `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `pd` still has the same structure, with `pd[1]` being 0 and each subsequent element being the sum of the integer values of the characters in the corresponding string index, plus the value of the previous element. The input stream `stdin` is still empty, and the string `i` and character `j` retain their original values.
