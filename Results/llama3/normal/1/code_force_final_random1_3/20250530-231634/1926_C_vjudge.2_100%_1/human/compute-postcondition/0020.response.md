Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is a string with no characters, `j` is the last character in the string `i`


The loop iterates over each character in the string `i` and increments `pd[i]` by the integer value of the current character `j`. After all iterations, `pd[i]` will be increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i`, and `i` will be an empty string since all characters have been processed. The value of `j` will be the last character in the original string `i`.
