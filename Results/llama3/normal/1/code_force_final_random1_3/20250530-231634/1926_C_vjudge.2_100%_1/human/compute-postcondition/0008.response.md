Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second character in the string `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is a string with at least 2 characters.**

The value of `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second character in the string `i`, which is `j`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
