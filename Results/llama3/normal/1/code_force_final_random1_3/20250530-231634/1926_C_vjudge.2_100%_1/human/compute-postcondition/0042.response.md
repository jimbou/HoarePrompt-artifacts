The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that is equal to the input integer from stdin, stdin is empty, and the value of `pd[n]` is being printed, which is the cumulative sum of the integer values of all characters in the strings from 1 to `n` and the cumulative sum of the previous values in the list `pd`.**
