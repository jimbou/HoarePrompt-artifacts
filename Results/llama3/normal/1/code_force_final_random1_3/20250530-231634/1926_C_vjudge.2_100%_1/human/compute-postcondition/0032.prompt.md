Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, N is 200001, pd is a list of 200001 zeros, stdin contains t lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, N):
    pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
    for j in str(i):
        pd[i] += int(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is a string with at least 0 characters, `j` is an empty string

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is a string with no characters, `j` is the last character in the string `i`


The loop iterates over each character in the string `i` and increments `pd[i]` by the integer value of the current character `j`. After all iterations, `pd[i]` will be increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i`, and `i` will be an empty string since all characters have been processed. The value of `j` will be the last character in the original string `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i` which is `2`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first digit of `i`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second digit of `i`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the third digit of `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is an integer between 100 and 9999 inclusive and has at least 3 digits, `j` is the third digit of `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `pd[i]` has been increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i`, and `i` is an integer between 100 and 9999 inclusive and has at least 3 digits.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
