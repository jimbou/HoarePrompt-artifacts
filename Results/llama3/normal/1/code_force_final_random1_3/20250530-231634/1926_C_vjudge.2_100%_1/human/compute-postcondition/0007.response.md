The only object in the loop head is variable  j and string i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string i.  If the string i has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, string i has at least 1 character, j is the first character of the string i. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string i must have at least 2 characters and the j is the second character in the string i.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character of the string `i`**
