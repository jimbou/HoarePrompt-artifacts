Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer that is equal to the input integer from stdin, stdin is empty, and the value of `pd[n]` is being printed, which is the cumulative sum of the integer values of all characters in the strings from 1 to `n` and the cumulative sum of the previous values in the list `pd`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has iterated `t` times. The list `pd` remains unchanged, with each element `pd[i]` being the cumulative sum of the integer values of all characters in the strings from 1 to `i` and the cumulative sum of the previous values in the list `pd`. The variable `n` is still an integer that is equal to the input integer from stdin, and stdin is empty. The value of `pd[n]` is being printed, which is the cumulative sum of the integer values of all characters in the strings from 1 to `n` and the cumulative sum of the previous values in the list `pd`.
