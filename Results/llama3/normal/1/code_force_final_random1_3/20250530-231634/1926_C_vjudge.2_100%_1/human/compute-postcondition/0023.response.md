The only variables in the loop head are variable  j and i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 2, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `j` is the last character in the string `i`, which is 2. So for the loop to be executed, `j` must be the first character in the string `i` because the loop iterates over the string `i` from the first character to the last character.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is 2, `j` is the first character in the string `i`**
