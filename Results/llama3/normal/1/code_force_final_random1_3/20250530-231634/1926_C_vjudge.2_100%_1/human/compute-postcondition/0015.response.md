The only object in the loop head is variable  j and string i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string i.  If the string has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, i is a string with at least 1 character, j is the first character in the string i. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 2 characters and the j is the second character in the string i.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of `j` which is the first character in the string `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character in the string `i`**
