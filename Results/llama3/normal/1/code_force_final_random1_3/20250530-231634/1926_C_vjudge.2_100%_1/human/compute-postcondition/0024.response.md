Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i` which is `2`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is 2, `j` is the second character in the string `i`**

In this output state, the value of `pd[2]` has been updated to include the integer value of the first character in the string `i`, which is `2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `j` has also been updated to point to the second character in the string `i`.
