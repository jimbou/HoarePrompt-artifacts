Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is a string with at least 1 character, `j` is the first character of the string `i`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `pd[i]` has been increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `pd` now contains the updated value at index `i`. The input in `stdin` is still present, containing `t-1` lines each with an integer `n`. The string `i` and its first character `j` also remain unchanged.
