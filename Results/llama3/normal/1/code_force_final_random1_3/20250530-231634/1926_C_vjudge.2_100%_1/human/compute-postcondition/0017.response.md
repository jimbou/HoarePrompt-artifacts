To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for j in str(i):`, which means we are iterating over the characters in the string `i`. The current state is:

* `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive
* `N` is 200001
* `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of `j` which is the second character in the string `i`
* `stdin` contains 0 lines
* `i` is a string with at least 2 characters
* `j` is the second character in the string `i`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when we move to the next character in the string `i`.

* `t` remains unchanged, as it is not related to the loop.
* `N` remains unchanged, as it is not related to the loop.
* `pd` remains unchanged, as it is not related to the loop.
* `stdin` remains unchanged, as it is not related to the loop.
* `i` remains unchanged, as it is the string being iterated over.
* `j` will be the next character in the string `i`. Since `j` is currently the second character, the next character will be the third character in the string `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of `j` which is the third character in the string `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is a string with at least 3 characters, `j` is the third character in the string `i`**
