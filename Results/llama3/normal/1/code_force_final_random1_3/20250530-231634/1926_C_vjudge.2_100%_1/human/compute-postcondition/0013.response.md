The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`. If the string `i` has at least 1 character, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is a string with at least 1 character and `j` is now the first character in the string `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string `i`**
