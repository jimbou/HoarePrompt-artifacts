Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then reads t integers, each representing a number n. For each n, it calculates the cumulative sum of the integer values of all characters in the strings from 1 to n and the cumulative sum of the previous values in a list pd. The function prints the calculated cumulative sum for each n.**
