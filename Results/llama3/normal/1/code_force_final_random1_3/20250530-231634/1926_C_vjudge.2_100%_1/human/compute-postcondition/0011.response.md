The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a string with at least 0 characters and `N` is 200001. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is a string with at least 1 character.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, `j` is an empty string**
