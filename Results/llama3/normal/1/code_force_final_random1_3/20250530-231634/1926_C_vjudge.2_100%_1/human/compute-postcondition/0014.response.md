Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of `j` which is the first character in the string `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string `i`**

In this output state, the value of `pd[i]` has been updated by adding the integer value of the first character `j` in the string `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `pd` still has the same properties as before, but the value at index `i` has been incremented by the integer value of `j`.
