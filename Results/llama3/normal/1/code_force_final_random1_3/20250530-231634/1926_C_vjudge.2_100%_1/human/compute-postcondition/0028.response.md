Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i` which is `2`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first digit of `i`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second digit of `i`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is an integer between 100 and 9999 inclusive and has at least 2 digits, `j` is the second digit of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `pd[i]` has been increased by the integer value of the second digit of `i`, which is `j`. All other variables remain unchanged.
