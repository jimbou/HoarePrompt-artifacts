Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The given program uses a pre-computation approach to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to 2 * 10^5.

2. The program first initializes an array `pd` of size N (2 * 10^5 + 1) with all elements set to 0. This array will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums.

3. The program then iterates over all numbers from 1 to N-1. For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and adding it to the cumulative sum stored in `pd[i]`. The cumulative sum is updated by adding the sum of the digits of the current number to the cumulative sum of the previous number (`pd[i - 1]`).

4. After pre-computing the cumulative sums, the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the input number `n` and prints the cumulative sum stored in `pd[n]`, which represents the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.

5. The time complexity of the program is O(N + t), where N is the size of the pre-computation array (2 * 10^5 + 1) and t is the number of test cases. Since N is a constant, the time complexity is effectively O(t), which should be within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

6. The space complexity of the program is O(N), which is also within the reasonable limits.

7. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n is 1, 2, or 3, as shown in the example inputs and outputs.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
