Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the last character in the string `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `j` is the last character of the string `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the last character in the string `i`, and the value of `i` is a string with at least 2 characters. The values of `t`, `N`, `stdin`, and `j` remain unchanged.
