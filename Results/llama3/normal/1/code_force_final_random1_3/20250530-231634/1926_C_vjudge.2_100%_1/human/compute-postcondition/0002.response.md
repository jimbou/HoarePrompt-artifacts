The code `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` adds the value of `pd[i - 1]` to `pd[i]`. Since `i` is 1, this means that `pd[1]` is assigned the value of `pd[0]` plus its current value. Since `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros, `pd[0]` is 0, and `pd[1]` is also 0. Therefore, `pd[1]` remains 0.

The values of the other variables are not affected. `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is still 200001, `stdin` still contains `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros where `pd[1]` is still 0, `stdin` contains `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 1**
