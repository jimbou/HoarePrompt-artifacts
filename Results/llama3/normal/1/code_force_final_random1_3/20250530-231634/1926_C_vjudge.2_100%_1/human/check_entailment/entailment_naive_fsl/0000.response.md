Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a prefix sum array `pd` to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `N`, where `N` is the maximum possible value of `n`. This allows the program to efficiently calculate the sum of the numbers on the board for each test case by simply looking up the value in the `pd` array.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2. The program also handles large values of `n` efficiently, as the prefix sum array `pd` is calculated only once and can be reused for all test cases.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
