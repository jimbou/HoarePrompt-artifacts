Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is a string with at least 0 characters, `j` is an empty string**

In this output state, the value of `pd[i]` has been updated by adding the integer value of the first character in the string `i`. The string `i` has been modified to have at least 0 characters, and `j` is now an empty string. The values of `t`, `N`, and the remaining elements of `pd` remain unchanged. The number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
