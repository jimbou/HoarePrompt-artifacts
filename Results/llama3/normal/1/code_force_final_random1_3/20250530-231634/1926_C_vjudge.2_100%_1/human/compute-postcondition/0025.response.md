The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and j, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`.  If the string `i` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second character. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is the second character in the string `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `i` must have at least 3 characters and the `j` is the third character in the string `i`. Since `i` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, the string `i` can have at most 5 characters (for example, 10000). Therefore, `i` can be any integer between 100 and 9999 inclusive for the loop to execute one more time. Also, `j` is the third character in the string `i` which is the first digit of `i` (for example, if `i` is 100, `j` is 1).
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by the integer value of the first character in the string `i` which is `2`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is an integer between 100 and 9999 inclusive, `j` is the first digit of `i`**
