Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is still 0 and `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of all characters in the string `i` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]` and `pd[i]` is increased by `pd[i - 1]`, `pd[2]` is increased by `pd[1]`, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is 2, `j` is the last character in the string `i`**

In this output state, the value of `pd[2]` has been updated by adding the value of `pd[1]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `pd` still contains 200001 integers, and the values of `t`, `N`, `stdin`, `i`, and `j` are the same as in the initial state.
