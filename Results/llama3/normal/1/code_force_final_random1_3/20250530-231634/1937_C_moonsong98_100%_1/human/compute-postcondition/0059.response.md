Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and has at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `min_indices` and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `max_index`, and `min_indices` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still the next element in `min_indices`. The only change is that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration due to the `continue` statement.
