Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 1, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, and `min_indices` is a list containing either 0 or `max_index` or both 0 and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`. The value of `min_indices` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code, depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`. The values of the other variables, `n`, `max_index`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input.
