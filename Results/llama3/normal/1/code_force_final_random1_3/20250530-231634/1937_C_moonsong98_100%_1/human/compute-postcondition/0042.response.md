Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows:

- `n` remains an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, as it was in the initial state.
- `max_index` remains the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', as it was in the initial state.
- `i` has reached `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed all its iterations.
- `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, which is the result of the last iteration of the loop.
- `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index`, depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`. This indicates that the list of minimum indices has been updated based on the results of the loop iterations.
- stdin contains no input, as it was in the initial state.

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a final state where all variables have been updated based on the loop iterations, and the loop has completed its execution.
