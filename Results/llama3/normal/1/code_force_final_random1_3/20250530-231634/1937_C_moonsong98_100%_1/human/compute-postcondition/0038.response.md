Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 2, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 2)`, and `min_indices` is a list containing only 2.**

In this output state, the value of `min_indices` has been updated to be a list containing only the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
