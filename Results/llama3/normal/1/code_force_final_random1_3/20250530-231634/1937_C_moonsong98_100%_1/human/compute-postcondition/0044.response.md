According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `min_indices`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` which is either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is the first element in the list `min_indices`, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and has at least 1 element, `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` which is either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input.**
