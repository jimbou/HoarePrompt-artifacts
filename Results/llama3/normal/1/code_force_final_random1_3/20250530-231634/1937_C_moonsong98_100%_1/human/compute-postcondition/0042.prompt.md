Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)
    if res == '<':
        min_indices = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        min_indices.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `min_indices` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and if `res` is '=', 0 is also included in `min_indices`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer larger than 1 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 1, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, and `min_indices` is a list containing either 0 or `max_index` or both 0 and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', `min_indices` is a list containing 1. If `res` is '=', `min_indices` also contains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer larger than 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 2, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, 2)`, and `min_indices` is a list containing either 0 or `max_index` or both 0 and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', `min_indices` contains only 2. If `res` is '=', `min_indices` also contains 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
