Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer larger than 1 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 1, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, and `min_indices` is a list containing either 0 or `max_index` or both 0 and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '=', `min_indices` also contains 1.***
