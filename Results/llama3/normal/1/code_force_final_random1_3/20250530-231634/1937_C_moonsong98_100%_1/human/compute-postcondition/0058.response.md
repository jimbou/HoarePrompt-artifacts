To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in min_indices:`. This means that the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`, which is the loop variable, and `min_indices`, which is the iterable being looped over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`. This means that `min_indices` has at least 2 elements.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be the next element in `min_indices`. Since `min_indices` has at least 2 elements, we can assume that the next element exists.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and has at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`**

Note that we didn't change the state of `n`, `max_index`, or `res` because they are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted. We only adjusted the state of `i` and `min_indices` to reflect the next iteration of the loop.
