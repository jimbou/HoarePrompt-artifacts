Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 0, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, 0, 0, 0)`, stdin contains no input**

The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments 0, `max_index`, 0, and `i`, and assigns the returned value to `res`. Since `max_index` is 0 and `i` is 0, the function is called with arguments 0, 0, 0, and 0. The value of `res` is the result of this function call. The other variables, `n`, `max_index`, and `i`, are not changed by this code, and stdin still contains no input.
