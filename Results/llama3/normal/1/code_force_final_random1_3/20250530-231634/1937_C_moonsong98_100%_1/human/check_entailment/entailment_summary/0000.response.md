Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, where `p` is a secret sequence and `⊕` denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` is used to ask queries to the user, `func_2` is used to print the final answer, and `func_3` is the main function that implements the solution.

In `func_3`, the program first checks if `n` is 2, in which case it directly prints the answer `(0, 1)`. If `n` is greater than 2, it finds the maximum index `max_index` by iterating over all indices and asking queries using `func_1`. It then finds the minimum index `min_index` by iterating over all indices and asking queries using `func_1`. Finally, it prints the answer `(max_index, min_index)` using `func_2`.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are used to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the secret sequence, which allows the program to find the maximum and minimum indices.

The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to find the correct answer for any valid input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
