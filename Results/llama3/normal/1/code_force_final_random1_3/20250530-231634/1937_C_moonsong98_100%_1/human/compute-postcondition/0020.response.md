Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `min_indices` has been updated to be a list containing the value of `max_index`, which is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'. The values of `n`, `max_index`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged, and there is still no input in stdin.
