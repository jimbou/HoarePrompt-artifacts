Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and has at least 1 element, `res` is '=', `min_index` is `i`, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `min_index` has been updated to `i`, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The value of `i` is not specified, so `min_index` is now equal to this unspecified value of `i`. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
