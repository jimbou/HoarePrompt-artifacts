Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, 0, 0, 1)`, stdin contains no input**

The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments 0, `max_index`, 0, and `i`, and assigns the returned value to `res`. The values of `n`, `max_index`, and `i` are not changed by this code. The value of `res` is updated to the result of the function call. Since `stdin` contains no input, it remains unchanged.
