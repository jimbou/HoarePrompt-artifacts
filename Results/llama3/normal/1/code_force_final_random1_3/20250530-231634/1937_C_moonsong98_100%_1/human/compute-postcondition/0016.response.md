Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `max_index` remains 0, `i` is 2, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`. The values of `n`, `max_index`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains no input.
