Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `max_index` and assigned it the value 0. The state of the stdin also remains the same as it was empty initially and no input was taken or provided during the execution of the code.
