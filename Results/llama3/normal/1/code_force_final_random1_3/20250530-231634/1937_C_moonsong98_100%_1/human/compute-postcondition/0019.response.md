Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `max_index` will be the largest index `i` for which the function `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'. This is because `max_index` is updated to `i` whenever `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'.
- The value of `i` will be `n-1`, as the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- The value of `res` will be the result of the last call to `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`.
- The state of stdin remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
