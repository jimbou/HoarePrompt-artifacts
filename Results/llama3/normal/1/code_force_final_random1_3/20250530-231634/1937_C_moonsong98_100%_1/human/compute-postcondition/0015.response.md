To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for i in range(0, n):`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2.
- `max_index` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `max_index` remains 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, 0, 0, 1)`.
- stdin contains no input.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the condition that allows the loop to continue, which is `i` being less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (to 2), and `n` must be greater than 1 to satisfy the loop condition.

The states of `max_index`, `res`, and stdin do not affect the loop's continuation directly since they are not part of the loop head's conditional logic. Therefore, we only adjust `i` and ensure `n` is in a state that allows the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `max_index` remains 0, `i` is 2, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, 0, 0, 1)`, and stdin contains no input.**
