Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is now dependent on the output of the function `func_1` with the specified arguments.
