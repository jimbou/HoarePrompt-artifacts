Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `min_indices` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and if `res` is '=', 0 is also included in `min_indices`.***
