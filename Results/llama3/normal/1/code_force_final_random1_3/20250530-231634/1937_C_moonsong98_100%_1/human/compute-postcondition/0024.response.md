Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `min_indices` is a list containing 0, `res` is '<', and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `min_indices` has been updated to a list containing the current value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input.
