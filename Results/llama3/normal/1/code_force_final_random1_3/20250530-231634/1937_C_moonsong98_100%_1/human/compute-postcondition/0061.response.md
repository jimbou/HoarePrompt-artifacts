Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and has at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`**.

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, where `min_index` is either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
