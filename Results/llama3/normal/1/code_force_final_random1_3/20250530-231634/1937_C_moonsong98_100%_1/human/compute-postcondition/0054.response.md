Postcondition: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and has at least 2 elements, `res` is either '=' or not '=', `min_index` is either `i` if `res` is '=' or the first element of `min_indices` which is either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and `i` is the second element of `min_indices`. If `i` is equal to `max_index`, the loop skips to the next iteration.**
