The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list min_indices, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the min_indices.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, min_indices has at least 1 element, i is the first element of min_indices. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element of min_indices.
State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and has at least 2 elements, `res` is either '=' or not '='. If `res` is '=', then `min_index` is `i`. Otherwise, `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` which is either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, `i` is the second element of `min_indices`.**
