Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, `min_index` is the last element of `min_indices` which is either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, min_index)`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` remains the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` remains a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, `min_index` is updated to the last element of `min_indices` which is either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and `res` is updated to the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, min_index)`.
