To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, this condition is already met.

However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop can execute. Since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, we need to set `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the loop.

The other variables, `max_index`, `res`, `min_indices`, and stdin, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`, and stdin contains no input.**
