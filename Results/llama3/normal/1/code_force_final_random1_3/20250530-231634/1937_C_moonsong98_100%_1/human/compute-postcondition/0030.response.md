The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 1, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `min_indices` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and if `res` is '=', 0 is also included in `min_indices`.**
