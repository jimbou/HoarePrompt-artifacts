To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in range(0, n):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer larger than 1 and not equal to 2.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`.
- `min_indices` is a list containing either 0 or `max_index` or both 0 and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`.
- stdin contains no input.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` must still be larger than the new value of `i`, so `n` must be greater than 2.

The other variables (`max_index`, `res`, `min_indices`, and the state of stdin) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 2, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, and `min_indices` is a list containing either 0 or `max_index` or both 0 and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input.**
