Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, and the current value of `n` is 2, and the function `func_2` has been called with arguments 0 and 1, and stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as 2 because the code snippet does not modify it. The function `func_2` is called with arguments 0 and 1, but since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the program state. The stdin remains empty as there is no input operation performed in the code snippet.
