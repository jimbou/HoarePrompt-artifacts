Reasoning:  
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum index and then finds the minimum index that satisfies the condition. The program also handles the case where n is 2 separately. The program uses the functions func_1 and func_2 to interact with the user and get the results of the queries.

Correctness: **True**
