To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already given as an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, we can focus on `i`.

For the loop to execute, `i` should start at 0, as specified in the `range(0, n)` function. Additionally, since `n` is larger than 0, we can confirm that the loop will execute at least once.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, stdin contains no input, `i` is 0**
