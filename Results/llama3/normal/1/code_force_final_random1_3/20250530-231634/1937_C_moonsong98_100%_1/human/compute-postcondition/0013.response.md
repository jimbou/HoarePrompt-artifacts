The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_index`. Since `i` is 1, `max_index` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains no input, so it remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, 0, 0, 1)`, stdin contains no input**
