This function takes an integer n as input, where n is greater than or equal to 2. If n is 2, it calls the function func_2 with arguments 0 and 1 and returns without any output. If n is greater than 2, it finds the maximum index i for which func_1(0, max_index, 0, i) returns '<', then finds the minimum index i for which func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i) returns '=' or '<', and finally calls func_2 with the maximum and minimum indices. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variable n.
