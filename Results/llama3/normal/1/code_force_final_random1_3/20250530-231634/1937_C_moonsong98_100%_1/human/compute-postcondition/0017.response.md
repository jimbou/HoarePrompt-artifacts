The value of `max_index` is updated to be equal to `i`. Since `i` is 2, `max_index` is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, 1, 0, 2)`, and stdin contains no input.**
