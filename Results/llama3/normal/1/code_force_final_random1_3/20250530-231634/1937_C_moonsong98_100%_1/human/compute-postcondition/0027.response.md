Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and is equal to '=', `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and 0, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `min_indices` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `min_indices` now contains two elements: `max_index` and 0.
