Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and has at least 1 element, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` which is either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, and stdin contains no input. The current value of `i` is not equal to `max_index` and we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the current value of `i` is not equal to `max_index` and we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration.
