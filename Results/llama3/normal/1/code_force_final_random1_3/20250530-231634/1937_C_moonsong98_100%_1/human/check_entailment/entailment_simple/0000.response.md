Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum XOR value between any two indices in the secret sequence p. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If n is 2, it directly prints the answer as ! 0 1, which is correct because for n=2, the maximum XOR value can only be between the two elements.

2. For n > 2, it first finds the index of the maximum element in the sequence p by comparing each element with the current maximum element. This is done using the function func_1, which returns '<' if the first pair of elements is less than the second pair, '>' if the first pair is greater, and '=' if they are equal.

3. After finding the maximum element, it finds the indices of the minimum elements by comparing each element with the maximum element. If an element is less than the maximum element, it is added to the list of minimum indices.

4. Then, it finds the minimum element among the minimum indices by comparing each minimum index with the current minimum index.

5. Finally, it prints the maximum index and the minimum index as the answer.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses the given functions func_1 and func_2 correctly to find the maximum XOR value between any two indices in the secret sequence p.

Correctness: **True**
