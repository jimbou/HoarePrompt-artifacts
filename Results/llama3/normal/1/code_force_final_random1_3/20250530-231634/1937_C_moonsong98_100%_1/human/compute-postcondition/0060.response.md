Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `min_indices` is a list containing either `n-1` or `max_index` or both `n-1` and `max_index` depending on the value of `res` which was returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)` and has at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`. If `i` is equal to `max_index`, then the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped.***
