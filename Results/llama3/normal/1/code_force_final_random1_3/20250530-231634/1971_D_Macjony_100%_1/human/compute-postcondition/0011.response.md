The only variable in the loop head is variable j and s, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and s.  If j is less than len(s) - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the length of s needed to have been greater than 2 and j currently must be less than len(s) - 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 2, `j` is 1, `j` is less than len(s) - 1**
