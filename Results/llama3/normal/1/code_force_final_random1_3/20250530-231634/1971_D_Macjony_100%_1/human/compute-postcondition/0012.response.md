Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 2, `j` is 1, `j` is less than len(s) - 1, `count` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is increased by 1, while the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The string `s` still consists of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 2, and `j` is still 1 and less than the length of `s` minus 1.
