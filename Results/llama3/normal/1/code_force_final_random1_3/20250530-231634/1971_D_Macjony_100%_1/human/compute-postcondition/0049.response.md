Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length of at least 4, `j` is 2. If `s[2]` is equal to `s[3]`, then `count` is either 2 or 3 and `flag` is True if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[2]` is '1', otherwise `flag` is False. If `s[2]` is not equal to `s[3]`, then `count` is either 3 or 4. If `s[2]` is '0' and `s[3]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, the value of `flag` remains unchanged.***
