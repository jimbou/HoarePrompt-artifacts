Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4. If `s[1]` is '0' and `s[2]` is '1', then `count` is 3 and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `count` is 2 and `flag` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `count` is 4, `j` is 2, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `count` is 3 and `j` is 2.***
