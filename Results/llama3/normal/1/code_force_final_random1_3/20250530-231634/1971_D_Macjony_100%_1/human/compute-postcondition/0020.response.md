Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 3, `j` is 2, `j` is less than len(s) - 1, `count` is increased by 1. If the current character in `s` at index `j` is '0' and the next character at index `j+1` is '1', then `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, no change is made to `flag`.***
