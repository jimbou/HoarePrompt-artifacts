Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, i is t, stdin is empty, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), if '0' is followed by '1' in s, then count is one less than the number of times '0' and '1' appear consecutively in s, otherwise count remains the same, and j is len(s) - 1, and the count is printed**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be greater than or equal to 0, the variable i will be equal to t, the standard input (stdin) will be empty because all the strings have been read, the variable s will be the last string read from stdin, and the variable count will be the number of times '0' and '1' appear consecutively in s, minus one if '0' is followed by '1' in s. The variable j will be equal to the length of s minus 1, and the value of count will be printed.
