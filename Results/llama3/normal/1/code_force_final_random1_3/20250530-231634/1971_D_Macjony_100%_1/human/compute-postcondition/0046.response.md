Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length of at least 4, `j` is 2, `count` is either 3 or 4, and `flag` is True if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[2]` is '1', otherwise `flag` is False**

The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so it is now either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables are not affected.
