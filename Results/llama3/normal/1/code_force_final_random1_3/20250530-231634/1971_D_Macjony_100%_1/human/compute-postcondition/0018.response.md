Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 3, `j` is 2, `j` is less than len(s) - 1, `count` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input buffer still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The string `s` still consists of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 3, and `j` is still 2 and less than the length of `s` minus 1.
