Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 3, `j` is 2, `j` is less than len(s) - 1, `count` is increased by 1, `flag` is True**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `i` remains 0, the stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is still a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 3, `j` is still 2 and less than len(s) - 1, `count` has been increased by 1, and a new variable `flag` has been introduced with the value True.
