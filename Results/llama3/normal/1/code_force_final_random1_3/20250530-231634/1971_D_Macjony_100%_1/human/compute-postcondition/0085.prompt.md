Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), if '0' is followed by '1' in s, then count is one less than the number of times '0' and '1' appear consecutively in s, otherwise count remains the same, and j is len(s) - 1, and the count is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If there exists a j such that s[j] is '0' and s[j + 1] is '1', then count is between 0 and len(s)-1 and j is len(s) - 1. Otherwise, count is between 1 and len(s)., and the value of count is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 1, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), if flag is True, then count is between 0 and 499 (inclusive) and j is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and the value of count is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
