Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length of at least 3. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 3, `j` is 1, and `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 2, `j` is 1, and `flag` remains False.***
