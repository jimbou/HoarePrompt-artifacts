Output: **t is greater than 0, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If there exists a j such that s[j] is '0' and s[j + 1] is '1', then count is between 0 and len(s)-1 and j is len(s) - 1. Otherwise, count is between 1 and len(s)., and the value of count is being printed**
