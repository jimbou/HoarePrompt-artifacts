Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), if '0' is followed by '1' in s, then count is one less than the number of times '0' and '1' appear consecutively in s, otherwise count remains the same, and j is len(s) - 1***
