Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 2, `j` is 1, `j` is less than len(s) - 1, `count` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, no change in `flag` occurs.***
