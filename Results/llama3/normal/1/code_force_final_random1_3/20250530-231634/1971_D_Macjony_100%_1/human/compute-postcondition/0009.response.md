Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 1. If the current value of s[j] is not equal to the current value of s[j + 1], then count is 2, j is 0, and if s[j] is '0' and s[j + 1] is '1', then flag is True. Otherwise, flag remains False. If the current value of s[j] is equal to the current value of s[j + 1], then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
