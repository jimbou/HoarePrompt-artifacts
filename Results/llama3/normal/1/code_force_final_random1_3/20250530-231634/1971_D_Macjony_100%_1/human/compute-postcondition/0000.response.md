Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), which was read from the input. The stdin still contains the t strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), as they were not consumed by the code.
