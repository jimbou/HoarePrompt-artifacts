Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length of at least 2, `count` is 2, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[j + 1]`. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
