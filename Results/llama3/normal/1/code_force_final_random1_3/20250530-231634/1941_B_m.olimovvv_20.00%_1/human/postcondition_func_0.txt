This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines whether a given list of integers meets certain conditions. It checks if the first and last elements of the list are odd and if the adjacent elements are not consecutive odd numbers. Based on this, it prints 'YES' if the conditions are met and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and empties the stdin.
