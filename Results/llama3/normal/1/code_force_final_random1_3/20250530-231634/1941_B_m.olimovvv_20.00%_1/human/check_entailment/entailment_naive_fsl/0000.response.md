Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
1 2 7 2

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks the first and last elements of the array, and their relationship with the second and second-to-last elements, respectively. However, it does not check the rest of the array. In the example above, the program does not check the third element (7), which is not possible to make zero using the described operations.

A correct solution would need to check all elements of the array, not just the first and last ones.
