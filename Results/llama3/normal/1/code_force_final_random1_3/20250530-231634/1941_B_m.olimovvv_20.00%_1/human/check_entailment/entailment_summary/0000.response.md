Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The key insight here is that the operations can only decrease the elements of the array, and the parity of the elements (odd or even) is preserved. The program checks if the first and last elements of the array are odd and if the adjacent elements are not consecutive odd numbers. If these conditions are met, it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the operations.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the first or last element is odd and the adjacent element is not a consecutive odd number. In these cases, it's not possible to make all elements of the array zero using the operations.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes multiple test cases and produces the correct output based on the conditions.

Correctness: **True**
