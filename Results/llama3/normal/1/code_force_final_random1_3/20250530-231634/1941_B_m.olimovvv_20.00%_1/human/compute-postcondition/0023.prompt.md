Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1
        ] + 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is an integer, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty. If either the first element of b is odd and the second element is not 2 more than the first element, or the last element of b is odd and the second last element is not 2 less than the last element, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is an integer greater than 1, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty. If the first element of b is odd and the second element is not the first element plus 2, or the last element of b is odd and the second last element is not the last element plus 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *a is an integer, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty. If the first element of b is odd and not followed by a number that is 2 more than it, or the last element of b is odd and not preceded by a number that is 2 less than it, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
