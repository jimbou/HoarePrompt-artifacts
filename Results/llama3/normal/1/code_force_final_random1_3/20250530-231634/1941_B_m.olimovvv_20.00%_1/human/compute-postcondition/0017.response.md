Output State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `a`, overwriting its previous value. Since `a` was initially an integer greater than 1, its new value is an integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `b`, overwriting its previous value. Since `b` was initially a list of integers, its new value is also a list of integers. The code does not modify any other variables. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty because two inputs have been read.
