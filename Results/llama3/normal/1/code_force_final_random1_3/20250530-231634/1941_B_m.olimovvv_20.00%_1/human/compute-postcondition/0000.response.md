To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one integer available in `stdin`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value doesn't matter, but for the loop to execute, the input from `stdin` must contain at least one integer.

State: **stdin contains at least one integer, _ is any value**
