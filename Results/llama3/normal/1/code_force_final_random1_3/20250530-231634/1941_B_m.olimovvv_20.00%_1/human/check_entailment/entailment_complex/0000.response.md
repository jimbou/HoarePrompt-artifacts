Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The key insight is that if the first element of the array is odd, then the second element must be the first element plus 2, and if the last element of the array is odd, then the second last element must be the last element plus 2. This is because the operation can only decrease the elements by 1 or 2, and if the first or last element is odd, it must be decreased by 1 to become even, and the adjacent element must be decreased by 2 to maintain the parity.

The program correctly checks these conditions and prints 'NO' if they are not met, and 'YES' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
