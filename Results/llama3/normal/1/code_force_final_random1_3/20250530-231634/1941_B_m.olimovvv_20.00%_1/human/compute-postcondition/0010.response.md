Output State: **a is an integer greater than 1, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `a`, making `a` an integer greater than 1. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns them to `b`, making `b` a list of integers. After these operations, stdin is empty.
