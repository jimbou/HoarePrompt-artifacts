Output State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty. If the first element of b is odd and the second element is not the first element plus 2, or the last element of b is odd and the second last element is not the last element plus 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop will continue to execute until the input is exhausted, and the output state will remain the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times.
