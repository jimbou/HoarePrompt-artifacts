The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `input()` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `input()` must be greater than 1.
State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers, stdin is not empty and contains a string that represents an integer greater than 1**
