Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 3 integers, `ai` is the third integer in the list `a`, `year` is a multiple of `ai` plus `year % ai` or `ai`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` has been updated to be a multiple of `ai` plus the remainder of `year` divided by `ai`, or `ai` itself if the remainder is zero. All other variables remain unchanged.
