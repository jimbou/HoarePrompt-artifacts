Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 2 integers, `ai` is the second integer in the list `a`, `year` is a multiple of `ai`.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` remains at least 1, the value of `_` remains 0, there is one less test case in `stdin`, the value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100, the list `a` remains the same, the value of `ai` remains the second integer in the list `a`, and the value of `year` is now a multiple of `ai`.
