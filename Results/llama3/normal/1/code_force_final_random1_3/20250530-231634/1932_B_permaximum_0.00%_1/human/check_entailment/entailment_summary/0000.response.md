Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program uses a simple and efficient approach to calculate the year.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a`.
3.  It initializes a variable `year` to 0, which will store the year in which the n-th sign will occur.
4.  The program then iterates over each periodicity `ai` in `a`. For each `ai`, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign by adding the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` to `year`. If `year` is 0 (which is the case for the first sign), it simply adds `ai` to `year`.
5.  After processing all signs, the program prints the final value of `year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` is a clever optimization that avoids unnecessary calculations.

Correctness: **True**
