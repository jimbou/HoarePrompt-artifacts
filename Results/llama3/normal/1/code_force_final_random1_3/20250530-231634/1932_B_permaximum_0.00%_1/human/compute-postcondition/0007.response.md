The only objects in the loop head are variables  ai and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 integers, ai is the second integer in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and ai is the third integer in the list.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 3 integers, `ai` is the third integer in the list `a`, `year` is a multiple of `ai`.**
