To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for ai in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` must have at least 1 integer, and `ai` is the first integer in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 integers, and `ai` must be the second integer in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 2 integers, `ai` is the second integer in the list `a`, `year` is either 0 or `ai` or a multiple of `ai`**
