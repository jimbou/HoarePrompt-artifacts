Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, `year` is the least common multiple of all elements in the original list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty, and the variable `ai` will not be defined. The variable `year` will be equal to the least common multiple of all elements in the original list `a`. The other variables, `t`, `_`, stdin, and `n`, will remain unchanged.
