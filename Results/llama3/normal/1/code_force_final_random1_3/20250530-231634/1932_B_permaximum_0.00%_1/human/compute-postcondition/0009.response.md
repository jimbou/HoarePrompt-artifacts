Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an empty list, ai is not defined, year is a multiple of the least common multiple of all integers in the original list a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains the same. The loop iterates over the list `a`, and after all iterations, `a` becomes an empty list, and `ai` is no longer defined. The variable `year` becomes a multiple of the least common multiple of all integers in the original list `a`.
