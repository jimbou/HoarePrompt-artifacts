Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `year` is a multiple of `ai`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `ai` is the third integer in the list, `year` is increased by the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` or `ai` itself if the remainder is zero**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` is increased by the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` or `ai` itself if the remainder is zero. The other variables remain unchanged.
