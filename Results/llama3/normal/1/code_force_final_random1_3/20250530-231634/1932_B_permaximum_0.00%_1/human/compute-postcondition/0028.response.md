Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list, `year` is equal to `ai` plus `ai` modulo `ai` or `ai`.**

In this output state, the value of `year` has been updated to be equal to `ai` plus the result of `ai` modulo `ai` or `ai`. Since `ai` is the second element in the list `a`, the value of `year` is now dependent on the value of `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.
