Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `year` is a multiple of `ai`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ai` is the second integer in the list**

The code `year += year % ai or ai` updates the value of `year` by adding the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` if it's not zero, or `ai` if the remainder is zero. This effectively makes `year` a multiple of `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.
