The code `year += year % ai or ai` increments the value of `year` by the remainder of `year` divided by `ai`, or by `ai` if the remainder is 0.

Since `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, and `a` has at least 1 element, `ai` is an integer.

The value of `year` is initially 0. The expression `year % ai` will always be 0, because 0 divided by any integer is 0. Therefore, the expression `year % ai or ai` will always evaluate to `ai`.

So, the value of `year` is incremented by `ai`. The new value of `year` is `ai`.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list, `year` is equal to `ai`.**
