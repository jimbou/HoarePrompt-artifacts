Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    year = 0
    for ai in a:
        year += year % ai or ai
    print(year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an empty list, ai is not defined, year is a multiple of the least common multiple of all integers in the original list a, and the year is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `year` is a multiple of all integers in `a`, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, and the year which is a multiple of all integers in `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, `year` is the least common multiple of all elements in the original list `a`, and the least common multiple of all elements in the original list `a` which is `year` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
