The only objects in the loop head are variables  ai and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 1 element, ai is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the ai is the second element in the list.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list, `year` is equal to `ai`.**
