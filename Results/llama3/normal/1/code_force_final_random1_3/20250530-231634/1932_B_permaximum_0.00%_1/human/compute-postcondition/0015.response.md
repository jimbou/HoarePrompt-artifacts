Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `year` is either 0 or a multiple of `ai`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ai` is the first integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `year` has been updated to either 0 or a multiple of `ai`, depending on the value of `ai`. If `ai` is 1, `year` remains 0. If `ai` is greater than 1, `year` becomes a multiple of `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.
