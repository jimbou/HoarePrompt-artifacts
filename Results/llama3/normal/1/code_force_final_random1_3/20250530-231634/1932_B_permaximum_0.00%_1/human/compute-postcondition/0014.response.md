The only objects in the loop head are variables  ai and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, and year is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and ai is the first integer in the list.
State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, year is 0, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, ai is the first integer in the list**
