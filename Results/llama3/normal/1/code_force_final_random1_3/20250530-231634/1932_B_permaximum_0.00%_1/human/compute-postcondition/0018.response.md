To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for ai in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `ai` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, and `ai` is the second integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 integers, and `ai` must be the third integer in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers
* `ai` is the third integer in the list

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `stdin`, `n`, and `year`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `year` is a multiple of `ai`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `ai` is the third integer in the list**
