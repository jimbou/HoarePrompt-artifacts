To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for ai in a:`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 integer, and `ai` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 integers, and `ai` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `year` is either 0 or a multiple of `ai`, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ai` is the second integer in the list**
