According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 3, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, and year is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and ai is the first element in the list.
State: **t is at least 3, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, ai is the first element in the list, year is 0**
