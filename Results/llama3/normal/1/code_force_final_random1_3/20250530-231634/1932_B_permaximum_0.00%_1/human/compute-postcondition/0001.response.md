To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
