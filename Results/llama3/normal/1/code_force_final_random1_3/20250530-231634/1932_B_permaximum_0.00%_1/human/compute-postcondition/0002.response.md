Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, year is 0**

The code executes as follows: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `t` is at least 1, there are at least `t` test cases in stdin, and each test case starts with an integer `n`. After reading `n`, there are `t-1` test cases left in stdin. The second line reads `n` integers from stdin and assigns them to `a`. Since each test case contains `n` integers, `a` becomes a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6. The third line assigns 0 to `year`, which does not affect any other variables.
