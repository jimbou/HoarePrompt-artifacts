To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `ai` and the list `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, and `year` is 0.

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least 1 integer, and `ai` is the first integer in the list.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 1 integer, `ai` is the first integer in the list `a`, `year` is 0**
