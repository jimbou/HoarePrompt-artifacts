Output State: **t is at least 3, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of integers, year is 0**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains the same, as it was not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, as two inputs were read from stdin. The value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 100, as it was assigned the value of the first input. The list `a` is now populated with a list of integers, as it was assigned the value of the second input. The variable `year` has been initialized to 0. The value of `ai` is still undefined, as it was not assigned a value in the code.
