Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of sign periodicities, and for each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur. The key insight here is that the next year when the sign will occur is the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the current year. This is achieved by the expression `year % ai or ai`, which calculates the remainder of the current year divided by the sign's periodicity, or the sign's periodicity itself if the remainder is zero. This remainder is then added to the current year to get the next year when the sign will occur.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the signs have different periodicities
* When the signs have the same periodicity
* When the signs have periodicities that are multiples of each other
* When the signs have periodicities that are not multiples of each other

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the input list is empty, in which case the output will be 0.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
