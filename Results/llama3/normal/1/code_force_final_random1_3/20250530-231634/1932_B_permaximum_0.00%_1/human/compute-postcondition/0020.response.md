Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `year` is a multiple of all integers in `a`, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that the list `a` is exhausted (i.e., it is empty), and the variable `ai` is no longer defined because it was only defined within the scope of the loop. The variable `year` has been updated to be a multiple of all integers in the original list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, stdin, and `n`) remain unchanged because they were not affected by the loop.
