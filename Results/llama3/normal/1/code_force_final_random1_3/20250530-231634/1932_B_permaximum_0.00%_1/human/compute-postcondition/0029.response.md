To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `a` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, and `ai` is the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `ai` must be the third element in the list.

The other variables, `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `n`, and `year`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in the list, `year` is equal to `ai` plus `ai` modulo `ai` or `ai`.**
