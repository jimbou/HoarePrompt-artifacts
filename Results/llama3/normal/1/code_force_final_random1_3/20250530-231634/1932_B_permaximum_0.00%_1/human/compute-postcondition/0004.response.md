Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 that must have at least 1 integer, `ai` is the first integer in the list `a`, `year` is either 0 or `ai` or a multiple of `ai`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` is updated to either 0 or the first integer in the list `a` (`ai`) or a multiple of `ai`, depending on the remainder of `year` divided by `ai`. All other variables remain unchanged.
