Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, the product of the second last element of arr and the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the product of the second last element of arr, the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the element of arr at index i, tem is the product of the second last element of arr, the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the element of arr at index i, and i is len(arr) - 3**

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the new value of `tem` to the list. The value of `tem` is updated by multiplying it with the element of `arr` at index `i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
