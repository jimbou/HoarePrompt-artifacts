To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from the last index of the array `arr` down to 0, decrementing the index `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element
* `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1
* `tem` is the product of the last element of `arr` and 1
* `i` is `len(arr) - 1`

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* `i` needs to be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order.
* `arr` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.
* `ans` and `tem` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `tem` is the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**

Note that `i` is decremented by 1, and the other states remain unchanged.
