To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element, because the range starts from `len(arr) - 1` and goes down to `-1`. If `arr` is empty, the range will be invalid, and the loop won't execute.

So, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to ensure it has at least one element. The state of `i` should be adjusted to be `len(arr) - 1`, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
