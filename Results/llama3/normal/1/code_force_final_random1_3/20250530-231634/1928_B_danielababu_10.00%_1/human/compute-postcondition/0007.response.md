Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, ans is a list containing the product of all elements of arr in reverse order, tem is the product of all elements of arr, i is -1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that the list `arr` remains unchanged, the list `ans` contains the product of all elements of `arr` in reverse order, the variable `tem` holds the product of all elements of `arr`, and the loop counter `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
