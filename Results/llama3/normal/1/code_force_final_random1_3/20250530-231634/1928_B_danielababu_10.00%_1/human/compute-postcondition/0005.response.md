To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`

This is a for loop that iterates over a range of indices in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` down to `-1`. The step size is `-1`, which means the index `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element
* `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and the product of the second last element of `arr` and the product of the last element of `arr` and 1
* `tem` is the product of the second last element of `arr` and the product of the last element of `arr` and 1
* `i` is `len(arr) - 2`

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head. The only object in the loop head is the index `i`. According to the loop head, `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

So, to adjust the state, we need to decrease `i` by 1. The new value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 3`.

The other objects in the state, `arr`, `ans`, and `tem`, are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and the product of the second last element of `arr` and the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `tem` is the product of the second last element of `arr` and the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`**
