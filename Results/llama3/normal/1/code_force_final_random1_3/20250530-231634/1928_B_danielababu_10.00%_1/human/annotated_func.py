#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a non-negative integer.
    return int(input())
    #The program returns a non-negative integer that was provided as input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-negative integer from standard input and returns it without modification.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a result of converting a space-separated string from the standard input into an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input, converts each string into an integer, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as input in the stdin, separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, converts them into a list of integers, and returns this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were provided as input in the stdin, in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a space-separated list of integers from standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a list of strings from the input, where each string is separated by a space.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into a list of strings separated by spaces, and returns a map object containing this list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string.
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters in the string from stdin

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from standard input and returns it as a list of characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a line of input: a space-separated list of strings.
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings sorted in ascending order, where the strings are the input from stdin, split by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into a list of strings separated by spaces, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]

    #State: arr is a list of positive integers, ans is a list containing the cumulative product of all elements in arr, tem is the product of all elements in arr, i is len(arr) - 1
    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing the cumulative product of all elements in the list 'arr' of positive integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates the cumulative product of a list of positive integers and returns the result as a new list. It takes a list of positive integers as input and returns a list where each element is the product of all elements up to that point in the input list. The input list remains unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: arr is a list of non-negative integers, ans is a list containing the product of all elements of arr in reverse order, tem is the product of all elements of arr, i is -1
    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing the product of all elements of arr in reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and returns a new list containing the product of all elements in the input list in reverse order. The input list remains unchanged.
