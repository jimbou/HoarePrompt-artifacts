The only variables in the loop head are variables `i`, `x`, and `sqrt(x)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `sqrt(x) + 1`, which is greater than the upper limit of the range `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, so it needs to be adjusted to be within the range. 

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x)**
