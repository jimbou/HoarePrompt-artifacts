Output: ** `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 0, `i` is `sqrt(x) + 1`, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and satisfies the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, or `x // i` is greater than 0 and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and satisfies the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, or `x // i` is greater than 0 and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is being printed**
