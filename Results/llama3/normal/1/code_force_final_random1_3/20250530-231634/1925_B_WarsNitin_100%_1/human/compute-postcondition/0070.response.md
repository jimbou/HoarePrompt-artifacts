The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. 
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`**
