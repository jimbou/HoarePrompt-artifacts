The only variable in the loop head is variable  q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be increased by 1.
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is `sqrt(x) + 1`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (which is 1) and all possible divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and satisfy the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` or `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, and the maximum divisor `ans` is being printed**
