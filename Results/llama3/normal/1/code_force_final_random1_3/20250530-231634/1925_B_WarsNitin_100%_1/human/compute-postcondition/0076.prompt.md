Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, q is 2, i is sqrt(x) + 1, ans is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i` if the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by `i`. Additionally, if `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than 0, and the difference between `x` and `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` is divisible by the integer division of `x` by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is at least as large as the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
