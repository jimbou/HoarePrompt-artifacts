Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, q is 1, i is sqrt(x) + 1, ans is 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (which is 1) and `x` divided by `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i` if the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` divided by `i` is greater than 0, and the difference between `x` and `n` times `x` divided by `i` is divisible by `x` divided by `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 2. `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2. If `x` is divisible by 2 and `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by 2 is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by 2, then `ans` is also `x` divided by 2 and 2. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by 3, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2, and `x` divided by 3, if `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by 3 is greater than or equal to 0, `x` divided by 3 is greater than 0 and this difference is also divisible by `x` divided by 3. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2. If `x` is not divisible by 3, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2, if `x` is divisible by 2 and `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by 2 is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by 2. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
