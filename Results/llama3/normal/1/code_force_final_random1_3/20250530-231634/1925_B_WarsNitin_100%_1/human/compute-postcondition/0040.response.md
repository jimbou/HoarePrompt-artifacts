Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 2. `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2, and 2 if `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by 2 is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by 2. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2.***
