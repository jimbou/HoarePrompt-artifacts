To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Since `i` is initially `sqrt(x) + 1`, which is already equal to the upper bound of the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` for the loop to execute.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `ans` is 1**
