Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 0, `i` is `sqrt(x) + 1`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and satisfies the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, or `x // i` is greater than 0 and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the value of `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the given conditions. The loop will iterate over all possible divisors of `x` up to its square root, and for each divisor, it will check if the conditions are met. If they are, it will update the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the divisor. The loop will continue until it has checked all possible divisors up to the square root of `x`.
