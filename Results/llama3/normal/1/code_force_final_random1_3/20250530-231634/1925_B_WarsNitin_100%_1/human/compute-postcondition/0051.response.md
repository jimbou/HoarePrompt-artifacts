The code prints the maximum value of `ans`, which is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (which is 1) and all possible divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and satisfy the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` or `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`.

Since the exact values of `x`, `n`, `i`, and `ans` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum value of `ans` that satisfies the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value of ans that satisfies the given conditions)**
