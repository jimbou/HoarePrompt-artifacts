Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the result of this subtraction is divisible by `i`, or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and the result of `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. `ans` is now the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. This means that if `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 2), `ans` will be updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 2`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
