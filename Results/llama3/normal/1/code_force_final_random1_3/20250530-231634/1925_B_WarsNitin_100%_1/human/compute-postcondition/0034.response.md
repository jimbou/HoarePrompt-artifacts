Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (which is 1) and `x` divided by `i`, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` divided by `i` is greater than 0, and the difference between `x` and `n` times `x` divided by `i` is divisible by `x` divided by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is that `x` and `n` are still within their respective ranges, `q` and `i` remain unchanged, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the result of `x` divided by `i`. The conditions regarding the divisibility and relationships between `x`, `n`, and `i` are still satisfied.
