State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (which is 1) and `x` divided by `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i` if the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` divided by `i` is greater than 0, and the difference between `x` and `n` times `x` divided by `i` is divisible by `x` divided by `i`.**
