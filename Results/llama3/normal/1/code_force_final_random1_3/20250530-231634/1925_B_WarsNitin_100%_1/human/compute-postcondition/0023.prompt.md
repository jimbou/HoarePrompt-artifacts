Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, ans is 1, q is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i` if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the result of this subtraction is divisible by `i`, or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and the result of `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i` if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the result of this subtraction is divisible by `i`, or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and the result of `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. If `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and the result of `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 0, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by 3, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 3` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and the result of `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as its previous value. If `x` is not divisible by 3, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i` if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the result of this subtraction is divisible by `i`, or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and the result of `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
