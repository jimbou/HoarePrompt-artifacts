Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers x and n.

2. The program correctly calculates the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` or `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. This is done by iterating over all numbers from 1 to the square root of x and checking if they are divisors of x.

3. The program correctly prints the maximum divisor for each test case.

4. The program handles the case where x is a perfect square correctly, as it checks both i and x // i as potential divisors.

5. The program handles the case where n is equal to x correctly, as it checks if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0 or x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0.

6. The program handles the case where x is 1 correctly, as it initializes ans to 1 and does not change it if x is 1.

7. The program handles the case where n is 1 correctly, as it checks if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0 or x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0.

Correctness: **True**
