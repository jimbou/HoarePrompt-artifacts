Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (which is 1) and `i` (which is 1), stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i`.***
