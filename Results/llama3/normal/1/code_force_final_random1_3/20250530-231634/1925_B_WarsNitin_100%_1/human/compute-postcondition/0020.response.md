Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 0, `i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`, where `x // 3` is the integer division of `x` by 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
