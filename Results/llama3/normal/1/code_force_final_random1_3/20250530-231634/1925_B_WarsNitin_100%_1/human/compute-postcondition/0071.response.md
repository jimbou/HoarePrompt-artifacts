The code assigns the maximum value between `ans` and `i` to `ans`. The initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, so we cannot determine its exact value after the assignment. However, we can say that `ans` is now the maximum of its previous value and `i`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
