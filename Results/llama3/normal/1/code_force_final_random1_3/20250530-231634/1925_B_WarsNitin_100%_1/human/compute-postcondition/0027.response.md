Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, q is 1, i is sqrt(x) + 1, ans is 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x)**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to x and n. The value of x is between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, and the value of n is between 1 and x inclusive. The variable ans is initialized to 1. The variable q is still 1, and the variable i is still sqrt(x) + 1. Stdin now contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers x and n.
