Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i` if the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by `i`. Additionally, if `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than 0, and the difference between `x` and `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` is divisible by the integer division of `x` by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.***
