Output: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and satisfies the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` or `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, and the maximum divisor `ans` is being printed**
