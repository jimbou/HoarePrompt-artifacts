The code assigns the maximum value between `ans` and `i` to `ans`. The value of `ans` is updated to be at least as large as `i`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`, `ans` is at least as large as `i`.**
