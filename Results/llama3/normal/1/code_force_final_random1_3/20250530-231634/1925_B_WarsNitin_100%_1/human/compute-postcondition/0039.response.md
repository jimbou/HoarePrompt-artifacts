Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2, and 2.**

In natural language, the output state is that `x` and `n` remain within their respective ranges, `q` is still 1, and `i` is still 2. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value (which was the maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2) and 2.
