Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`. `ans` is at least as large as the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The values of `x`, `n`, `q`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
