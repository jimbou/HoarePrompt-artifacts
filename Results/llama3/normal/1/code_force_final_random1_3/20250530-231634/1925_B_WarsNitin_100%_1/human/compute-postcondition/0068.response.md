Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`. If `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is at least as large as the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.***
