The code prints the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and satisfies the conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, or `x // i` is greater than 0 and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. Where `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `i` is `sqrt(x) + 1`, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and satisfies the conditions.

Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to sqrt(x) and satisfies the conditions x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0, or x // i is greater than 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0**
