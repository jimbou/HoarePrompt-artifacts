Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `ans` is 1, `q` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the result of this subtraction is divisible by `i`***
