To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `x` remains the same.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 1, `i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2. If `x` is divisible by 2 and `x` minus `n` times `x` divided by 2 is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by 2, then `ans` is also `x` divided by 2 and 2. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of the previous maximum of 1 and `x` divided by 2.**
