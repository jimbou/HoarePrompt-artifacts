Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `x`, `n`, `q`, and `i` are still valid, and the relationship between `x`, `n`, and `i` is maintained.
