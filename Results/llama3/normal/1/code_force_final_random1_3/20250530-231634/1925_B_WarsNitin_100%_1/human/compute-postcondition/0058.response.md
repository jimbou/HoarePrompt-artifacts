Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (which is 1) and `i`. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and this difference is also divisible by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (which was 1) and the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `x`, `n`, `q`, and `i` are still valid.
