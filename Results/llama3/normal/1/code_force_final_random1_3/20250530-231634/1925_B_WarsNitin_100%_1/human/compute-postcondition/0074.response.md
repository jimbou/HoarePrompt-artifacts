Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `q` is 2, `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i` is greater than the previous value of `i`. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
