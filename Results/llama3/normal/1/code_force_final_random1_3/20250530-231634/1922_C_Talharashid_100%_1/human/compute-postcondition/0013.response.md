Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers. If the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of `l` is less than the difference between the ith element and the (i-1)th element of `l`, then `d1` is a dictionary with keys 3, 4 and 5 and values 1, 2 and 1 + d1[4] respectively. Otherwise, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 3, 5, i+2 and i+3 and values 1, 1 + d1[i + 1], 1 + d1[i + 1] and l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1] respectively. `d2` is an empty dictionary and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[i + 2]` has been updated to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that determines the values of `d1` is still dependent on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `l`. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
