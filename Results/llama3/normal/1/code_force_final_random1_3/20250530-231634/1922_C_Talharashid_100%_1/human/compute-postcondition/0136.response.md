Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[n - 2]` is 1 + `d2[n - 1]` which is 2, `m` is an integer from the input, `j` is an integer from the input that is equal to `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+1` inputs. The current value of `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is still valid.
