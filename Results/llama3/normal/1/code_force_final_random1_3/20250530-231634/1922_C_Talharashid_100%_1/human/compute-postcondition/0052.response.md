The code prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. 

Here, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`. 

`y` is an integer from the input and `x` is also an integer from the input.

Output: **the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` (where `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are values from the dictionary `d1` that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and `y` and `x` are integers from the input)**
