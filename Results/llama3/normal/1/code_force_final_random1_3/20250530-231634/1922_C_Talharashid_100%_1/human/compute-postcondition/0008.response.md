The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers. If the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of `l` is less than the difference between the ith element and the (i-1)th element of `l`, then `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2 and 3 and values 1 and 2 respectively. Otherwise, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2 and i+2 and values 1 and l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1] respectively. In both cases, `d2` is an empty dictionary and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**
