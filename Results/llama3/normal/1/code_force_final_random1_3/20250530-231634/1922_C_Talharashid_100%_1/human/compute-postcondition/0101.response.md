The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 1, `j` is an integer from the input that is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the values of `d1` at keys `y` and `x` is printed, which is `d1[y] - d1[x]`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` is printed.**
