Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, l is a list of integers, d1 is a dictionary with keys from 2 to n and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l, d2 is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l and the values of d2 itself, m is an integer, j is m, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus m+2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
        d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
    else:
        d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. If the difference between the element at index `i+1` and the element at index `i` in `l` is less than the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `l`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is greater than or equal to the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, and `d1[3]` is assigned the value `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. If `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1` has an additional key-value pair where the key is `i + 2` (which is 4) and the value is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` (which is 1 plus the value of `d1[3]`). Otherwise, `d1` has an additional key-value pair where the key is `i + 2` and the value is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. If `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1` has an additional key-value pair where the key is `i + 2` (which is 5) and the value is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]` (which is 1 plus the value of `d1[4]`). Otherwise, `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
