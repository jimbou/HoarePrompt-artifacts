The code prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. Since `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2, and `x` and `y` are integers, the values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]` depend on the differences between consecutive elements in list `l` and the values of `d2` itself.

Output: **the difference between the value of d2 at index y and the value of d2 at index x (where y and x are integers and d2 is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in list l and the values of d2 itself)**
