Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. The current value of the difference between the element at index `i+1` and the element at index `i` in `l` is less than the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `d1[i + 2]` has been updated to be 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
