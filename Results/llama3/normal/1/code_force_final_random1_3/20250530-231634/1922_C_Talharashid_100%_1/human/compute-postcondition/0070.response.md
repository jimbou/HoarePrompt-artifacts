To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer greater than 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but we know that `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs.**

Note that the states of `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, `y`, and stdin are not changed, as they are not part of the loop head.
