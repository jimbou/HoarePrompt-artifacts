State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to n and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n-1 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l and the values of d2 itself, `m` is an integer from the input, `j` is an integer from the input that is equal to m, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus m inputs. If the difference between the third and second elements of `l` is less than the difference between the second and first elements of `l`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`.**
