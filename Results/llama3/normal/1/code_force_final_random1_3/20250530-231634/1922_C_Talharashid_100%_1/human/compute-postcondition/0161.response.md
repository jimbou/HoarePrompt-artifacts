The code prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. 

`d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`. 

`y` and `x` are integers from the input.

Since the exact values of `y`, `x`, `n`, and `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Output: **the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` (where y and x are integers from the input and d1 is a dictionary with keys from 2 to n and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l)**
