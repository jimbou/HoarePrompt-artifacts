The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 2.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer that must be at least 2, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 4 inputs. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` is printed.**
