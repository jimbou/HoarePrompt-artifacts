Output State: **`i` is `1`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `1` to `2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element in `l`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The loop counter `i` has reached 1.
- The integer `n` remains greater than 1.
- The list `l` of integers remains unchanged.
- The dictionary `d1` still contains keys from 2 to 1 with values depending on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`.
- The dictionary `d2` now contains keys from 1 to 2 with values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself.
- The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
- The values of `d2[i]` are determined based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2[i + 1]`, following the logic of the loop body.
