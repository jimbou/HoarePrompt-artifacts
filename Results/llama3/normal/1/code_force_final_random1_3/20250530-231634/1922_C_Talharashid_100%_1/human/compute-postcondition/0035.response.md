Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `1` to `2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer that must be at least 1, `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 4 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The code only affects the input from stdin, which now contains at least 1 test case minus 4 inputs, and introduces two new variables `x` and `y`, which are assigned integer values from the input.
