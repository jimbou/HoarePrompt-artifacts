The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `n-3` and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs.**
