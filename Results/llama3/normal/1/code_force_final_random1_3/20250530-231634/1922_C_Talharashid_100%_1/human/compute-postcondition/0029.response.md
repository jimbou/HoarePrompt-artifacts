Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n-2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `n-3` to `n-4` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to be 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`, which means that the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element in `l`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
