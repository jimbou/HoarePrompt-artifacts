Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer that must be at least 3, `j` is 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 6 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to the two integers from the input, and the stdin now contains one less input. The other variables remain unchanged.
