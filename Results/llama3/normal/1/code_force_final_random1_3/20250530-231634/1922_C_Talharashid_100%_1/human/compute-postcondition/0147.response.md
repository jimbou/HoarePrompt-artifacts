Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-4`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[n - 2]` is 2, `d2[n - 3]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 2]` which is 3 or `l[n-3] - l[n-4] + d2[n - 2]`. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[n-4]` is 1 + `d2[n - 3]`. Otherwise, `d2[n-4]` is `l[n-4] - l[n-5] + d2[n - 3]`. `m` is an integer from the input, `j` is an integer from the input that is equal to `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+1` inputs.***
