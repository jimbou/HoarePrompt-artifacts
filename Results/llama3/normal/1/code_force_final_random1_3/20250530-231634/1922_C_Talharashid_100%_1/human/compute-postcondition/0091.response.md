Output State: **`i` is `0`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer from the input, `j` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `m` has been updated to be an integer from the input, and the values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs, since one input has been consumed to update the value of `m`.
