The code prints the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x`. Where `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `y` is an integer from the input, and `x` is an integer from the input.
Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are values in dictionary d2 at keys y and x respectively)**
