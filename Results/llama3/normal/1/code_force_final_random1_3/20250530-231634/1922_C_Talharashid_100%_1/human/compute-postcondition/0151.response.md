Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[n - 2]` is 2, `d2[n - 3]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 2]` which is 3 or `l[n-3] - l[n-4] + d2[n - 2]`, `d2[n-4]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 3]` or `l[n-4] - l[n-5] + d2[n - 3]`, and so on until `d2[1]` is either 1 + `d2[2]` or `l[1] - l[0] + d2[2]`, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m` inputs.**

The code assigns the values of `x` and `y` from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus `m` inputs minus 1, we update the number of test cases in the stdin.
