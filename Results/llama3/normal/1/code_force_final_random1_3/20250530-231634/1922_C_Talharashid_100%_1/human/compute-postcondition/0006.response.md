Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2 and i+2 and values 1 and l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1] respectively, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of `l` is larger than or equal to the difference between the ith element and the (i-1)th element of `l`**

In this output state, the value of `d1` has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is `i+2` and the value is the result of the expression `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition on the list `l` is still valid, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
