The code prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`, where `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`. The current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`. Since the exact values of `y`, `x`, and the differences between consecutive elements in `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Output: **the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` (where `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, and `y` and `x` are integers with `y` greater than `x`)**
