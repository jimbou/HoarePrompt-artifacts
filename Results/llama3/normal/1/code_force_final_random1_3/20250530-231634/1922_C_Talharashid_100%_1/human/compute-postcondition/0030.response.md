Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n-2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `n-3` to `n-4` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[i]` is equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to be equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, which means it now depends on the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements in `l`, as well as the value of `d2[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
