Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `1` to `2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `m` is an integer that was read from the input, and the stdin now contains one less input. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
