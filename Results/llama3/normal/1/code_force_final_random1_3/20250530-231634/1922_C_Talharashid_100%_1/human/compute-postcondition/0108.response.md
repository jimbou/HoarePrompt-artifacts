The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 2, `j` is an integer from the input that is 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the values of `d1` at keys `y` and `x` is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` is being printed.**
