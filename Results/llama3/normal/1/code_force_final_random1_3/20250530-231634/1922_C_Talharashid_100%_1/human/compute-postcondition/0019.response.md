Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `n-1` maps to 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The current value of `i` is such that the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element in `l`.***
