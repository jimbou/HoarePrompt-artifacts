Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer from the input, `j` is an integer from the input that is equal to `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `j` is now equal to `m`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs.
