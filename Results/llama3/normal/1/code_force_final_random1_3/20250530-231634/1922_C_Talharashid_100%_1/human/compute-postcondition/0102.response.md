Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 1, `j` is an integer from the input that is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `x` and `y` from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `x` and `y` are now integers from the input. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs, we include this information in the output state.
