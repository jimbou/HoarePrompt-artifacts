Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer n, a list of n distinct non-decreasing integers, another integer m, and m pairs of distinct integers. The function calculates and prints the differences between specific values in the list, based on the pairs of integers provided. The function iterates over each test case, processing the input and printing the results.**
