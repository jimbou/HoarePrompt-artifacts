Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with a key 2 and value 1, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of `l` is larger than or equal to the difference between the ith element and the (i-1)th element of `l`***
