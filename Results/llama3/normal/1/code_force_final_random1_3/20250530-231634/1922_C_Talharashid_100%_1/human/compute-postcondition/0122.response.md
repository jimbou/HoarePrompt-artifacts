Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to n and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l, where `d1[3]` is assigned the value `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n-1 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l and the values of d2 itself, `m` is an integer from the input, `j` is an integer from the input that is equal to m, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus m+1 inputs. The difference between the second and first elements of `l` is not less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[3]` has been updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the previous value of `d1[2]`. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus m+1 inputs.
