Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d1` has an additional key-value pair where the key is `i + 2` and the value is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[i + 2]` is calculated based on the difference between consecutive elements in `l` and the value of `d1[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs.
