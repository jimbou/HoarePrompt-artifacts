Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs, and `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[5]` has been updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the previous value of `d1[4]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
