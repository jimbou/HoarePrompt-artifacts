Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[n - 2]` is 2, `d2[n - 3]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 2]` which is 3 or `l[n-3] - l[n-4] + d2[n - 2]`, `d2[n-4]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 3]` or `l[n-4] - l[n-5] + d2[n - 3]`, and so on until `d2[1]` is either 1 + `d2[2]` or `l[1] - l[0] + d2[2]`, `m` is an integer from the input, `j` is an integer from the input that is equal to `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m` inputs.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[n - 2]` is 2, `d2[n - 3]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 2]` which is 3 or `l[n-3] - l[n-4] + d2[n - 2]`, `d2[n-4]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 3]` or `l[n-4] - l[n-5] + d2[n - 3]`, and so on until `d2[1]` is either 1 + `d2[2]` or `l[1] - l[0] + d2[2]`, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m` inputs. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at index `y` and the value of `d1` at index `x` is being printed. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the difference between the value of `d2` at index `y` and the value of `d2` at index `x` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[n - 2]` is 2, `d2[n - 3]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 2]` which is 3 or `l[n-3] - l[n-4] + d2[n - 2]`, `d2[n-4]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 3]` or `l[n-4] - l[n-5] + d2[n - 3]`, and so on until `d2[1]` is either 1 + `d2[2]` or `l[1] - l[0] + d2[2]`, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m-1` inputs. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at index `y` and the value of `d1` at index `x` is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the value of `d2` at index `y` and the value of `d2` at index `x` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[n - 2]` is 2, `d2[n - 3]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 2]` which is 3 or `l[n-3] - l[n-4] + d2[n - 2]`, `d2[n-4]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 3]` or `l[n-4] - l[n-5] + d2[n - 3]`, and so on until `d2[1]` is either 1 + `d2[2]` or `l[1] - l[0] + d2[2]`, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m-1` inputs. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x` is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
