Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[n - 2]` is 2, `d2[n - 3]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 2]` which is 3 or `l[n-3] - l[n-4] + d2[n - 2]`, `d2[n-4]` is either 1 + `d2[n - 3]` or `l[n-4] - l[n-5] + d2[n - 3]`, and so on until `d2[1]` is either 1 + `d2[2]` or `l[1] - l[0] + d2[2]`, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m` inputs. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at index `y` and the value of `d1` at index `x` is being printed. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the difference between the value of `d2` at index `y` and the value of `d2` at index `x` is being printed.***
