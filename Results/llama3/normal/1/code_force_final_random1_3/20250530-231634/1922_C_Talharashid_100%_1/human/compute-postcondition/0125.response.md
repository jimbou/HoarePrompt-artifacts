Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to n and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l, where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n-1 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l and the values of d2 itself, `m` is an integer from the input, `j` is an integer from the input that is equal to m, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus m inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[i + 2]` has been updated to be 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus m inputs.
