Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+3` inputs. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop counter `j` will be equal to the number of iterations `m`. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last pair of integers read from the input. The input stream will have at least `m+3` fewer inputs than initially. The loop will have printed the differences between the values of `d1` or `d2` based on the comparison of `x` and `y` for each iteration.
