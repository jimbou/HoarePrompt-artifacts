The code prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. 

Here, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`. 

Since the exact values of `y`, `x`, `n`, and the list `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are the values of d1 at indices y and x respectively)**
