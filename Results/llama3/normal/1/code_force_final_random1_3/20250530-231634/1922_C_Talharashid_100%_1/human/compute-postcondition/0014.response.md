Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers. `d1` is a dictionary with keys 3, 4, 5 and i+2 and values 1, 2, 1 + d1[4] and l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1] respectively. `d2` is an empty dictionary and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[i + 2]` has been updated to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d1` now has an additional key-value pair with key `i+2` and value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The rest of the preconditions remain valid.
