To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `1` to `2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs. So for the loop to be executed  the value of `m` must be at least 1 and `j` is 0.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `1` to `2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, `j` is 0**
