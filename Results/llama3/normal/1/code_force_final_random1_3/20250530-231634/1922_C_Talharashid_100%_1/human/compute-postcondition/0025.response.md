Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n-2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `n-2` to `n-3` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, and `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The current value of `i` is such that either the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element in `l`, or the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `l` is larger than or equal to the difference between the `(i+1)-th` and `i-th` elements of `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to be 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `i` and the differences between consecutive elements in `l` are still satisfied.
