The code prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. Since `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2, and `x` and `y` are integers from the input, the values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]` depend on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `l` and the values of `d2` itself.

Output: **the difference between the values of d2[y] and d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are values from the dictionary d2 that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in the list l and the values of d2 itself)**
