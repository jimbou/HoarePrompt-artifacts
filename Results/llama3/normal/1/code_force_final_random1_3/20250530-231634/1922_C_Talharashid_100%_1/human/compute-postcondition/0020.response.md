Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `n-1` to `n-2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The current value of `i` is such that the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element in `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to be 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`, which means that the value of `d2[i]` now depends on the value of `d2[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The condition that the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element in `l` is still true.
