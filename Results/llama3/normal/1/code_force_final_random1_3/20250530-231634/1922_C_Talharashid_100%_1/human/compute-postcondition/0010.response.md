Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2, 3, and i+2 and values 1, 2, and l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1] respectively, `d2` is an empty dictionary, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[i + 2]` is updated to be the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of `l`, plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
