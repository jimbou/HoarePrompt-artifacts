Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, where `d2[n-3]` is 1 plus `d2[n-2]`, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `d2` at index `i` (which is `n-3`) is updated to be 1 plus the value of `d2` at index `i+1` (which is `n-2`). The values of the other variables remain the same.
