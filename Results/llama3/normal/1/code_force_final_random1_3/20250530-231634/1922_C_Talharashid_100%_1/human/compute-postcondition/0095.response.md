The code prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`, where `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `l`. The values of `y` and `x` are integers from the input, where `y` is greater than `x`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are values in dictionary d1 that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in list l, and y and x are integers from the input)**
