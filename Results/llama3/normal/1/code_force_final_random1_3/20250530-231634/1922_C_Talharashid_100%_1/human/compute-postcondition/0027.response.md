Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-3`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n-2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `n-2` to `n-3` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element in `l`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.***
