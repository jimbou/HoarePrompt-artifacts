According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input from `stdin`. If `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, `stdin` must contain at least 1 test case and `i` is 0.
State: **`stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `i` is 0**
