Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 2, `j` is an integer from the input that is 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+3` inputs. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x` is printed.**
