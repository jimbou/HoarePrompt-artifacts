Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from `n-1` to `n-2` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `l` is larger than or equal to the difference between the `(i+1)-th` and `i-th` elements of `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` is updated to be the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `l`, plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. This means that `d2[i]` now depends on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself. The other variables remain unchanged.
