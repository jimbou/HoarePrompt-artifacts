Postcondition: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element in `l`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to be the difference between the element at index `i` and the element before it in `l`, plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`.**
