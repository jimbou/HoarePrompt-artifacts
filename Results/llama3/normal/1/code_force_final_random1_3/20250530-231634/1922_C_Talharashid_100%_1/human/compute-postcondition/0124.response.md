To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 2.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 2, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to n and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to n-1 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in l and the values of d2 itself, `m` is an integer from the input, `j` is an integer from the input that is equal to m, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus m+1 inputs.**
