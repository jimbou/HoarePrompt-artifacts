The code prints the difference between the values of `d1` at keys `y` and `x`. Where `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `y` is an integer from the input that is greater than `x`, and `x` is an integer from the input.
Output: ** `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer from the input that is greater than 0, `j` is an integer from the input that is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, and `y` is an integer from the input that is greater than `x`. Additionally, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+3` inputs, and this is printed: the difference between the values of `d1` at keys `y` and `x` which is `d1[y] - d1[x]`**
