Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers. If the difference between the (i+1)th element and the ith element of `l` is less than the difference between the ith element and the (i-1)th element of `l`, then `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2, 3 and 4 and values 1, 2 and 1 + d1[3] respectively. Otherwise, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2, 4 and i+2 and values 1, 1 + d1[i + 1] and l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1] respectively. `d2` is an empty dictionary and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.***
