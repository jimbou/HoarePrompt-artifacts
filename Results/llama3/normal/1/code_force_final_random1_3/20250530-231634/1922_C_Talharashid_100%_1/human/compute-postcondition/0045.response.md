The code prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`, where `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `y` is an integer, and `x` is an integer.

Output: **the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` (where `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are values in dictionary `d1` that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in list `l`)**
