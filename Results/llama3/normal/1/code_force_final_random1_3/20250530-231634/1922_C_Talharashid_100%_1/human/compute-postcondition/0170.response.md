The code prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. 

`d2[y]` is the value of the dictionary `d2` at key `y`, and `d2[x]` is the value of the dictionary `d2` at key `x`. 

The values of `d2` depend on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `l` and the values of `d2` itself. 

The exact values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `l`, `y`, and `x`. 

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

Output: **the difference between the values of d2[y] and d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values of the dictionary d2 at keys y and x respectively)**
