Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `n-1` maps to 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `d2` has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is `n-1` and the value is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
