Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. The difference between the second and first elements of `l` is greater than or equal to the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`***
