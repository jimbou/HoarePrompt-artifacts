The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2 and i is now 1. 
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with a key 2 and value 1, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
