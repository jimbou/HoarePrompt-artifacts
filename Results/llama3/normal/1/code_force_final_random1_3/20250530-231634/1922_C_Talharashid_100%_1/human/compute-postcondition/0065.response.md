Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to 2 and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. If the difference between the element at index `i+1` and the element at index `i` in `l` is less than the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `l`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is greater than or equal to the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, and `d1[3]` is assigned the value `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`.**
