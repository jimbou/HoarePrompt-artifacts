Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-3`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[n-3]` is 1 plus `d2[n-2]`. Otherwise, `d2[n-3]` is `l[n-3] - l[n-4] + d2[n-2]`.***
