Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers. The current value of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`. `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2 and 3 and values 1 and 2 respectively, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `d1` has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is `i + 2` (which is 3) and the value is `1 + d1[i + 1]` (which is 2). The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
