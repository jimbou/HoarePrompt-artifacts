Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, l is a list of integers, d1 is a dictionary with a key 2 and value 1, d2 is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged as 0. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the first input in `stdin`. The list `l` is populated with a list of integers from the second input in `stdin`. The dictionary `d1` has a key-value pair of 2 and 1, respectively. The dictionary `d2` remains empty. Finally, `stdin` now contains at least 1 test case minus the 2 inputs that were consumed by the code.
