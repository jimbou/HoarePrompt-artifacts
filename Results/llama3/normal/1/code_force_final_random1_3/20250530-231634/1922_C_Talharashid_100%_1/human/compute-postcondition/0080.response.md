Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and the values of `d2` itself, `m` is an integer, `j` is `m`, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus `m+2` inputs. The difference between the element at index `i` and the element before it in `l` is greater than or equal to the difference between the element after `i` and the element at index `i` in `l`. `d2[i]` is updated to be the difference between the element at index `i` and the element before it in `l`, plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `d2[i]` has been updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `l` and the value of `d2[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The difference between the element at index `i` and the element before it in `l` is still greater than or equal to the difference between the element after `i` and the element at index `i` in `l`.
