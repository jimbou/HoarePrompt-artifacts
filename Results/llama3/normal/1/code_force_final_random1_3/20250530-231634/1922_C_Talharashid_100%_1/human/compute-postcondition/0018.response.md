To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 2, because the range starts from `n-2` and goes down to 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n-1` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: `n-1` maps to 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**
