To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `numTest`. The loop will execute as long as `numTest` is greater than 0.

State: **`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9)**
