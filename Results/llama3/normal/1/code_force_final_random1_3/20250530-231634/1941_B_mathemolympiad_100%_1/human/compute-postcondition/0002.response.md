Output State: **numTest is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9), stop is False, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) minus the first test case**
