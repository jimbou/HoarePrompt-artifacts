Postcondition: ***numTest is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9), if the current value of a[i] is less than 0, then stop is True and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the next test case.***
