The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is some value greater than `i + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.
State: **`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i], `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 2`**
