Output State: **numTest is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i]. If the current value of a[i] is less than 0 at any point, then stop is True and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the next test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list 'a' will have all its elements set to 0 up to the second last element. The elements at indices i+1 and i+2 will be reduced by 3 times and 1 time the original value of the element at index i respectively. If at any point during the execution of the loop, the value of an element in the list 'a' becomes negative, the program will print 'NO' and stop. Otherwise, it will continue with the next test case.
