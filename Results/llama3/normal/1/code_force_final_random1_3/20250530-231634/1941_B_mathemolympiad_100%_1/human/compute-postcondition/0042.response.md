To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]`, and `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]`, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is not printed because `a[i]` is not less than 0.**
