Postcondition: ***`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where a[i] is reduced by its original value, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, `i` is n - 2, and 'NO' is not printed because a[i] is not less than 0 for all i in the range 0 to n - 2. If the current value of stop is True, then the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. Otherwise, the execution of the code continues. If the current value of a[len(a) - 1] is not equal to 0 or the current value of a[len(a) - 2] is not equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the last two elements of the list `a` are both 0, and 'YES' is printed.***
