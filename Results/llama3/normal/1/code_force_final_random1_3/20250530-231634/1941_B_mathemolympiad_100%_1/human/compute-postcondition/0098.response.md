Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then attempts to reduce the integers in each test case to zero by iteratively subtracting the value of each integer from itself, the next integer, and the integer after that. If it is possible to reduce all integers to zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.**
