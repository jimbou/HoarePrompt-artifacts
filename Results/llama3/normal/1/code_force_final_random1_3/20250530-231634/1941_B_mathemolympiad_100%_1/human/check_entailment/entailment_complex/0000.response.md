Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iteratively applying the operation to the array elements. However, the approach is incorrect.

The issue lies in the fact that the program is subtracting the value of each element from itself, the next element, and the element after that. This is not the correct way to apply the operation, as it does not take into account the fact that the operation can be applied any number of times.

A correct approach would be to check if the sum of the elements at each index is divisible by 3, and if the sum of the elements at each index is non-negative. If these conditions are met, then it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
