Postcondition: **numTest is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i]. The current value of stop is True, indicating that the value of a[i] was less than 0 at some point, and 'NO' has been printed.**
