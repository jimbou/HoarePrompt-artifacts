Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(0, numTest):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    stop = False
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
        if a[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            stop = True
            break
        opNum = a[i]
        a[i] -= opNum
        a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
        a[i + 2] -= opNum
    if stop == True:
        continue
    if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i]. If the last two elements of `a` are not 0, 'NO' is printed and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the last two elements of `a` are 0, 'YES' is printed. If the current value of `a[i]` was less than 0 at any point, then `stop` is True, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where a[i] is reduced by its original value, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, `i` is n - 2, and 'NO' is not printed because a[i] is not less than 0 for all i in the range 0 to n - 2. If the current value of stop is True, then the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. Otherwise, the execution of the code continues. If the current value of a[len(a) - 1] is not equal to 0 or the current value of a[len(a) - 2] is not equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the last two elements of the list `a` are both 0, and 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: numTest is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers where a[i] is reduced by its original value, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, i is n - 1. If the last two elements of a are both 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If stop is True, indicating that there exists at least one a[i] that is less than 0 for i in the range 0 to n - 2, then the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. Otherwise, the execution of the code continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
