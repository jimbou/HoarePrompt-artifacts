Output State: **`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where a[i] is reduced by its original value, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, `i` is n - 1, and `stop` is True, indicating that there exists at least one a[i] that is less than 0 for i in the range 0 to n - 2, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement only skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration, without changing any variable values.
