Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but the correct output should be "NO". The reason is that the program only checks if the last two elements of the array are zero, but it does not check if the entire array can be made zero using the given operation.

In this case, the array [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] cannot be made zero using the operation because the first element is 1, which is odd, and the operation can only decrease the elements by 1 or 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Note that the program only checks if the last two elements are zero, but it does not check if the entire array can be made zero using the given operation. This is the main reason why the program is incorrect.
