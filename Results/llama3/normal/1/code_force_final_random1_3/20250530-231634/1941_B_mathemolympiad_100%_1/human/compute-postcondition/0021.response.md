Output State: **numTest is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers. If a[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed, and stop is True. Otherwise, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i], i is increased by 1, n is greater than i + 2.**

The code executes the following operations:

1. `opNum = a[i]`: Assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`.
2. `a[i] -= opNum`: Subtracts the value of `opNum` from `a[i]`, effectively setting `a[i]` to 0.
3. `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum`: Reduces the value of `a[i + 1]` by 3 times the original value of `a[i]`.
4. `a[i + 2] -= opNum`: Reduces the value of `a[i + 2]` by the original value of `a[i]`.

The combined effect of these operations is that `a[i]` is set to 0, and `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are reduced by 3 times and 1 times the original value of `a[i]`, respectively. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `n` remains greater than `i + 2`. The value of `numTest` and the condition `stop` are not affected by the code.
