Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using this operation.

The program iterates over the array from the first element to the third last element. For each element, it calculates the number of operations needed to make the current element zero and applies this operation to the current element, the next element, and the element after that. If at any point the program encounters a negative number, it immediately prints "NO" and moves on to the next test case.

After applying the operations to all elements, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles the edge case where the input array has less than three elements, as it doesn't attempt to access the last two elements in this case.

Correctness: **True**
