Output State: **numTest is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers where a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i], i is increased by 1, n is greater than i + 2.**

In this output state, the value of `numTest` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `n` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` is modified according to the given rules: `a[i]` becomes 0, `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]`, and `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is still greater than `i + 2`.
