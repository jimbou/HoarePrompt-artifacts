Postcondition: **`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 1, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]`, and `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]`, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and `stop` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
