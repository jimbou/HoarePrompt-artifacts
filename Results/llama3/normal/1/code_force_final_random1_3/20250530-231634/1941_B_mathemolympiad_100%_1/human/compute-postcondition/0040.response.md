Postcondition: ***numTest is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i]. If a[i] is less than 0, then stop is True, stdin is empty, i is 0, and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
