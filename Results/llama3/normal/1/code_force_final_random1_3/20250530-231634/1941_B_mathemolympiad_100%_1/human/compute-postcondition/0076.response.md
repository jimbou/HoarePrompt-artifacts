Output: **`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `n` is an integer (4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where `a[i]` is reduced by its original value, `a[i + 1]` is reduced by 3 times the original value of `a[i]`, and `a[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in the range 0 to `n - 2`, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is less than 0, then `stop` is True. Otherwise, `stop` remains False., and 'NO' is printed**
