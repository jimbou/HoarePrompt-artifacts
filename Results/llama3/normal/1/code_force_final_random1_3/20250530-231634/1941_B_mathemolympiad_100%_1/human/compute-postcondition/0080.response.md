To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

The other variables, `numTest`, `a`, and `stop`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `n` is an integer (4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where a[i] is reduced by its original value, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, `i` is 2, `stop` is False if a[i] is not less than 0, otherwise `stop` is True**
