Postcondition: **`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where a[i] is 0 for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i]. The current value of `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or the current value of `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0. If the current value of `a[i]` was less than 0 at any point, then `stop` is True, 'NO' is printed, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next test case.**
