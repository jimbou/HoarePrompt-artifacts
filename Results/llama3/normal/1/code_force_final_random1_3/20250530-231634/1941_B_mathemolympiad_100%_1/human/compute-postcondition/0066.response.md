Output State: **numTest is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is greater than 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers where a[i] is reduced by its original value, a[i + 1] is reduced by 3 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of a[i] for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, i is n - 1, and 'NO' is not printed because a[i] is not less than 0 for all i in the range 0 to n - 2, stop is False, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of numTest remains unchanged, still an integer t between 1 and 10^4, and greater than 0. The value of n is updated to an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, which is the input value. The list a is updated to a list of n integers, where each element is reduced by its original value, the next element is reduced by 3 times the original value of the previous element, and the element after that is reduced by the original value of the previous element, for all indices in the range 0 to n - 2. The value of i remains n - 1. The variable stop is set to False. The value of n is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers.
