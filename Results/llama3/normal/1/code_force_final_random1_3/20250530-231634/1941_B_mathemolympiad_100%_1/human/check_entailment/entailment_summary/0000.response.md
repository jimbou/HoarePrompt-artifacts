Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using this operation. The program iterates over the array from left to right, applying the operation as many times as possible at each index. If at any point it encounters a negative number, it immediately prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. If it successfully reduces all elements to zero, it prints 'YES'. If there are any non-zero elements left at the end, it prints 'NO'. This approach is correct because it simulates the operation described in the problem statement and checks for the possibility of reducing all elements to zero.

Correctness: **True**
