The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numTest`. The stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then for each test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). After accepting the first integer, the stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). The value of `numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numTest` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).**
