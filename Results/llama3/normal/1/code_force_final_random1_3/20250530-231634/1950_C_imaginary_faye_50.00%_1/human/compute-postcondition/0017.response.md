Output State: **s is a string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h is a string of length 2 representing the hour part of the time in the 24-hour format, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is updated to the first string from stdin, which is a valid time in the 24-hour format. The value of `h` is updated to the hour part of the time `s`, which is a string of length 2. The stdin now contains `t-1` strings, as one string has been consumed by the `input()` function.
