The code prints the minute part of the time which is s[2:], and 'AM' if the hour part of the time which is h is less than 12, otherwise 'PM'.
Output: **s is a string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h is a string of length 2 representing the hour part of the time in the 24-hour format, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format. If the hour part of the time which is h is '00', then the string '12' is printed. Otherwise, if the hour part of the time which is h is less than or equal to 12, then the hour part of the time which is h is printed. Otherwise, the hour part of the time in the 24-hour format minus 12 is printed, with a leading zero if necessary., and this is printed: "[s[2:]] [AM/PM]"**
