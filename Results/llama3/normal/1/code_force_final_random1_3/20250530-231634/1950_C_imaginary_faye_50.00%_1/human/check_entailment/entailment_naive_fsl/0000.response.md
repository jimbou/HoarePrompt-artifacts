Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the hour is between 13 and 23. In this case, the program prints '0' followed by the hour minus 12, which is incorrect. For example, when the input is '14:34', the program prints '02:34 PM' instead of '02:34 PM'. The correct output should be '02:34 PM' without the leading '0'.

The correct code should be:

```
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('{}{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

In this corrected code, when the hour is between 13 and 23, it prints the hour minus 12 without the leading '0'.
