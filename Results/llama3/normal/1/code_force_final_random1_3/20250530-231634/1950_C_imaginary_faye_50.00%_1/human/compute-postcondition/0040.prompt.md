Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) followed by t strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    h = s[:2]
    if h == '00':
        print('12', end='')
    elif int(h) <= 12:
        print(h, end='')
    else:
        print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
    print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format, s is a string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h is a string of length 2 representing the hour part of the time in the 24-hour format. If the hour part of the time is '00', '12' is printed. Otherwise, the hour part of the time is printed in 12-hour format if it is less than or equal to 12, otherwise it is printed in 12-hour format. and this is printed: the minutes part of the time which is s[2:] and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the time is greater than or equal to 12 or not

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: s is a string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h is a string of length 2 representing the hour part of the time in the 24-hour format, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format. If the hour part of the time which is h is '00', then the string '12' is printed. Otherwise, if the hour part of the time which is h is less than or equal to 12, then the hour part of the time which is h is printed. Otherwise, the hour part of the time in the 24-hour format minus 12 is printed, with a leading zero if necessary., and this is printed: "[s[2:]] [AM/PM]"

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: s is a string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h is a string of length 2 representing the hour part of the time in the 24-hour format, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format. If the hour part of the time is '00', the string '12' is printed. Otherwise, the hour part of the time is printed in a 12-hour format: if the hour is 12 or less, the original hour is printed; if the hour is greater than 12, the hour minus 12 is printed, prefixed with '0' if necessary. The minutes part of the time in the 24-hour format, and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the time is greater than or equal to 12 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
