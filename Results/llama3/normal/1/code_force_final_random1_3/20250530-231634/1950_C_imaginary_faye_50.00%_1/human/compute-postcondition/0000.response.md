According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1440. So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be at least 1 and the stdin must contain a positive integer t followed by t strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format.
State: **stdin contains a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) followed by t strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format, t is at least 1**
