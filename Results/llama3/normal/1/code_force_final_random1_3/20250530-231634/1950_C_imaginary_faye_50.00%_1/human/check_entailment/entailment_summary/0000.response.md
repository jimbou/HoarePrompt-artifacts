Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format. It correctly handles the different cases for hours: '00', less than or equal to 12, and greater than 12. It also appends 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour. The program uses the input() function to read the number of test cases and the time strings, and it uses a for loop to process each test case. The time string is sliced to extract the hour and minute parts, and the hour is converted to 12-hour format accordingly. The program uses the end='' argument in the print() function to print the time and 'AM' or 'PM' on the same line.

Correctness: **True**
