The code prints the minute part of the time represented by the string `s`, and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour part of the time represented by the string `h`.

The minute part of the time is obtained by slicing the string `s` from index 2 to the end, which gives the substring `mm`. This is because the format of the time string is `hh:mm`, so the minute part starts at index 2.

The 'AM' or 'PM' part is determined by the hour part of the time, which is represented by the string `h`. If the hour part is greater than or equal to 12, then 'PM' is printed; otherwise, 'AM' is printed. This is achieved by using a list indexing trick, where `int(h) >= 12` is a boolean expression that is converted to an integer (0 or 1) and used to index into the list `['AM', 'PM']`.

Output: **mm (the minute part of the time), [AM or PM] (depending on the hour part of the time)**
