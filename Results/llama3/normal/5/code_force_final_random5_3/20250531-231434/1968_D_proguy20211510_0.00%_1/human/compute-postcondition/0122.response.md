Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 1, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is True, stdin is empty, i is 0. The current value of a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa**

In this output state, the value of `foundb` has been updated to True, and the list `b` now contains the value of `a[pb - 1]`, which is equal to `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
