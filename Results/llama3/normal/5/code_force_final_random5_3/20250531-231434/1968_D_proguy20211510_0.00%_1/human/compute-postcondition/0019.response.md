Postcondition: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0. If a[pb - 1] and a[ps - 1] are both equal to maxa, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If only a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, then 'Bodya' is printed and the loop continues. If only a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then 'Sasha' is printed and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If neither a[pb - 1] nor a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the loop continues without printing anything.**
