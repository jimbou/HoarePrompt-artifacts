Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game between two players, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', based on the maximum value of their respective scores, which are calculated by iterating through a permutation and an array. The function takes no parameters and returns no values, but instead prints the result of each test case to the standard output. The possible outcomes are 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', depending on whether the maximum score of 'Bodya' is greater than, less than, or equal to the maximum score of 'Sasha', respectively.**
