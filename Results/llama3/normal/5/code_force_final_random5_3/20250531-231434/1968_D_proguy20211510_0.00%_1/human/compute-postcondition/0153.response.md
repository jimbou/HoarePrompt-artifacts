Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 3, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list containing the element at index pb - 1 in list a and the element maxa, s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is True, stdin is empty, i is 2. If founds is True, then s contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements. If founds is False, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a, and ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p. If a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa, then ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p, and s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If foundb and founds are both True, then b and s each have an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If foundb and founds are not both True, then b and s are unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The code sets `foundb` to `True` and appends the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` to list `b`. The value of `pb` remains unchanged. The list `b` now contains the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` and the element `maxa`. The value of `maxa` remains unchanged as the maximum value in list `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `s`, `founds`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `s` remains unchanged unless `founds` is `True`, in which case it contains the element `maxa` in addition to its previous elements. If `founds` is `False`, then `s` contains the element at index `ps - 1` in list `a`, and `ps` is the element at index `ps - 1` in list `p`. If `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `s` contains the element at index `ps - 1` in list `a`. If `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, then `ps` is the element at index `ps - 1` in list `p`, and `s` contains the element at index `ps - 1` in list `a`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, then `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are not both `True`, then `b` and `s` are unchanged.
