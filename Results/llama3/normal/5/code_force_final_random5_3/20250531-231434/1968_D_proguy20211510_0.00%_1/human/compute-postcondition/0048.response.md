Output State: **If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `b` is a list containing four elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 2]`, and `s` is a list containing two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing one element: `a[pb - 2]`, and `s` is not affected. `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 2]`.**
