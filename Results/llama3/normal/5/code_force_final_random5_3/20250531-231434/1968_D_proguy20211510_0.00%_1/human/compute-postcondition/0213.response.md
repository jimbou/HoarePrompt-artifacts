Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0. The current value of `foundb` is True, and `b` is a list with two elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa, `preb` is a list, `pres` is a list that must have at least len(s) elements, `ptsb` is a list, `ptss` is a list, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `i`, `stdin`, `sb`, `ss`, `foundb`, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb` remains the same as the initial state. The only change is that the list `b` now has two elements: the first element is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and the second element is maxa.
