Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list that must have at least `len(s)` elements, `founds` is a boolean, `foundb` is a boolean, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb` and each element of `b`, `pres` is a list that must have at least `len(s)` elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements of `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements of `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the sum of `preb[i]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for all `i` in range(`len(s)`), `ptss` is a list containing the sum of `pres[i]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for all `i` in range(`len(s)`), `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of two new variables `maxs` and `maxb`, which are assigned the maximum values in the lists `ptss` and `ptsb`, respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
