Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is k, foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, s is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, pb is equal to either p[pb - 2] or p[p[pb - 2] - 1], ps is equal to either p[ps - 1] if founds is True or either p[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] equals maxa or p[p[ps - 1] - 1] if a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa if founds is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The loop has finished executing, and the variables `foundb` and `founds` are both set to True. The list `b` contains 2k elements, where each element is either `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` or `maxa`, and the list `s` also contains 2k elements, where each element is either `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` or `maxa`. The variables `pb` and `ps` have been updated to point to the next element in the list `p`, and the variable `i` has been incremented to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
