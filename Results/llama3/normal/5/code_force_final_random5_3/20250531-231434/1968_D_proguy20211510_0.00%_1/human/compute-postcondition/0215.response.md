Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0. `foundb` is False, `b`, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb` remain unchanged. The current value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**
