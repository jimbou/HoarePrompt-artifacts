Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is k, foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, s is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, pb is equal to either p[pb - 2] or p[p[pb - 2] - 1], ps is equal to either p[ps - 1] if founds is True or either p[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] equals maxa or p[p[ps - 1] - 1] if a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa if founds is False, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0.**

The code initializes two empty lists `preb` and `pres`, and two variables `sb` and `ss` to 0. These new variables do not affect the existing state of other variables.
