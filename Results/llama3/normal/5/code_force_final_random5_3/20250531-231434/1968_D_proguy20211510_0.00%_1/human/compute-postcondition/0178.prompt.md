Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list that must have at least `len(s)` elements, `founds` is a boolean, `foundb` is a boolean, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb` and each element of `b`, `pres` is a list containing the sum of `ss` and each element of `s`, `sb` is the sum of all elements of `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements of `s`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pres)):
    rem = k - (i + 1)
    ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
    ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 0, preb is a list containing the sum of sb and each element of b, pres is a list that must have at least 1 element, sb is the sum of all elements of b, ss is the sum of all elements of s, ptsb is a list containing the sum of preb[0] and (k - 1) * b[0], ptss is a list containing the sum of pres[0] and (k - 1) * s[0]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 1, preb is a list containing the sum of sb and each element of b, pres is a list that must have at least 2 elements, sb is the sum of all elements of b, ss is the sum of all elements of s, ptsb is a list containing the sum of preb[0] and (k - 1) * b[0], and the sum of preb[1] and (k - 2) * b[1], ptss is a list containing the sum of pres[0] and (k - 1) * s[0], and the sum of pres[1] and (k - 2) * s[1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list that must have at least len(s) + 1 elements, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 2, preb is a list containing the sum of sb and each element of b, pres is a list that must have at least 3 elements, sb is the sum of all elements of b, ss is the sum of all elements of s, ptsb is a list containing the sum of preb[0] and (k - 1) * b[0], the sum of preb[1] and (k - 2) * b[1], the sum of preb[2] and (k - 3) * b[2], and the sum of preb[2] and (k - 3) * b[2] + (k - 4) * b[2], ptss is a list containing the sum of pres[0] and (k - 1) * s[0], the sum of pres[1] and (k - 2) * s[1], the sum of pres[2] and (k - 3) * s[2], and the sum of pres[2] and (k - 3) * s[2] + (k - 4) * s[2].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
