Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, stdin is empty. If the second last and last element of a are equal to maxa, then 'Draw' is printed. If the second last element of a is equal to maxa, then 'Bodya' is printed and we move on to the next iteration of the loop. If the last element of a is equal to maxa, then 'Sasha' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
