Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least 3, pb is an integer, ps is p[ps - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 2, stdin is empty, sb is 0, ss is 0, s is a list of integers with an additional element a[ps - 1]. If foundb is True, then b is a list with an additional element maxa, and if both foundb and founds are True, then s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, foundb is set to True, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, pb is updated to p[pb - 1], and b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1]. In all cases, preb, pres, ptsb, ptss, maxs, and maxb remain unchanged.**
