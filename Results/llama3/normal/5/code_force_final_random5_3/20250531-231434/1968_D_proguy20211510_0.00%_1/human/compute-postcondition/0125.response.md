Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list, `founds` is a boolean, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `foundb` is True and `b` contains `a[pb - 1]`. Otherwise, `foundb` is False, `b` contains the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a`, and `pb` is the element at index `pb - 1` in list `p`.***
