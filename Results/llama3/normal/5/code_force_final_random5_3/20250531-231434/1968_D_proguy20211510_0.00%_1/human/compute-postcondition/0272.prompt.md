Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is unchanged, `maxb` is unchanged, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `b`, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `s`, `b` is a list with `k` elements, `s` is a list with `k` elements, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pres)):
    rem = k - (i + 1)
    ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
    ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 0, ptsb is a list containing one element which is the sum of preb[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing one element which is the sum of pres[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * s[i], maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged, sb is the sum of all elements in b, ss is the sum of all elements in s, preb is a list containing the cumulative sum of b, pres is a list with at least 1 element, b is a list with k elements, s is a list with k elements, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 1, ptsb is a list containing two elements which are the sum of preb[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * b[i] and the sum of preb[i] and rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing two elements which are the sum of pres[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * s[i] and the sum of pres[i] and rem * s[i], maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged, sb is the sum of all elements in b, ss is the sum of all elements in s, preb is a list containing the cumulative sum of b, pres is a list with at least 2 elements, b is a list with k elements, s is a list with k elements, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 2, ptsb is a list containing three elements which are the sum of preb[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * b[i], the sum of preb[i] and (k - (i + 1)) * b[i], and the sum of preb[i] and rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing three elements which are the sum of pres[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * s[i], the sum of pres[i] and (k - (i + 1)) * s[i], and the sum of pres[i] and rem * s[i], maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged, sb is the sum of all elements in b, ss is the sum of all elements in s, preb is a list containing the cumulative sum of b, pres is a list with at least 3 elements, b is a list with k elements, s is a list with k elements, rem is an integer equal to k - (i + 1), stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
