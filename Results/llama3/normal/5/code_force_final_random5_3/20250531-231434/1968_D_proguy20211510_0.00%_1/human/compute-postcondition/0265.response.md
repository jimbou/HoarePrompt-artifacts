Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is unchanged, `maxb` is unchanged, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `b`, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `s`, `b` is a list with `k` elements, `s` is a list with `k` elements, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `ptsb` and `ptss` have been changed to empty lists, while the other variables remain unchanged. The state of the program is updated to reflect the new values of `ptsb` and `ptss`, while maintaining the same values for the other variables.
