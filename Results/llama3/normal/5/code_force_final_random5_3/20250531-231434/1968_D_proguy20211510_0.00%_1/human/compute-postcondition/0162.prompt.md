Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, founds is False, foundb is False, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list, `founds` is a boolean, `foundb` is a boolean, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If `foundb` is True, then `b` has an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, then `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then `b` contains the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a`, and `pb` is the element at index `pb - 1` in list `p`. If `founds` is True, then `s` has an additional element `maxa`. If `founds` is False, then `s` contains the element at index `ps - 1` in list `a`, and `ps` is the element at index `ps - 1` in list `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 2, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 1. If foundb is True, then b contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements. If foundb is False, then b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a, and pb is the element at index pb - 1 in list p. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a and foundb is True. Otherwise, pb is the element at index pb - 1 in list p, b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a and the element at index pb - 1 in list a. If foundb and founds are both True, then b and s each have an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If founds is True, then s contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements. If founds is False, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a, and ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p. If a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa, then ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p, and s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 3, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 2. If foundb is True, then b contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements. If foundb is False, then b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a, and pb is the element at index pb - 1 in list p. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a and foundb is True. Otherwise, pb is the element at index pb - 1 in list p, b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a and the element at index pb - 1 in list a. If foundb and founds are both True, then b and s each have an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If founds is True, then s contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements. If founds is False, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a, and ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p. If a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa, then ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p, and s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If foundb and founds are not both True, then b and s are unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
