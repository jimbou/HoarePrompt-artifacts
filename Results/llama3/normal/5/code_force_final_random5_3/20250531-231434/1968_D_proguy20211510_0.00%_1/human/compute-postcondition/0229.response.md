Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0. If `founds` is True, then `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `maxa`, `foundb` is either True or False, and `b` is either a list with two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` if `foundb` is True, or a list of integers with an additional element `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is False. If `founds` is False, then if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `founds` is True and `s` is a list with one element: `maxa`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`, `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[ps - 1]`, and `founds` is False. In all cases, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list with two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` if `foundb` was True, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. Additionally, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb` remain unchanged.***
