Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is a list containing `k` elements which are the sum of `preb[i]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` in range(`k`), `ptss` is a list containing `k` elements which are the sum of `pres[i]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` in range(`k`), `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `b`, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `s`, `b` is a list with `k` elements, `s` is a list with `k` elements, stdin is empty. The maximum value in `ptss` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `ptsb`. The current value of `maxs` is less than `maxb`, and 'Bodya' is printed.**
