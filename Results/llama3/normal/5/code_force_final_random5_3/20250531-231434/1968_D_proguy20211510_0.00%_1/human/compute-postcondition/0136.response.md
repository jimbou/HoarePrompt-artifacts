The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least 2, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list, `founds` is a boolean, `foundb` is a boolean, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. If `foundb` is True, then `b` has an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, then `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then `b` contains the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a`, and `pb` is the element at index `pb - 1` in list `p`. If `founds` is True, then `s` has an additional element `maxa`. If `founds` is False, then `s` contains the element at index `ps - 1` in list `a`, and `ps` is the element at index `ps - 1` in list `p`.**
