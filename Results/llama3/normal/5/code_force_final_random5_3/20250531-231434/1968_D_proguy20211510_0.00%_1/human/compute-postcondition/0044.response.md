Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', t is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is 1, foundb is True, b is a list containing three elements which are (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, founds is True, s is a list containing two elements which are (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `b` and `s` by appending `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to both lists. Since `foundb` is True, `b` already contains two elements, and the new element is appended to the end, making it a list of three elements. Similarly, since `founds` is True, `s` already contains one element, and the new element is appended to the end, making it a list of two elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
