Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 2, ptsb is a list containing three elements which are the sum of preb[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * b[i], the sum of preb[i] and (k - (i + 1)) * b[i], and the sum of preb[i] and rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing three elements which are the sum of pres[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * s[i], the sum of pres[i] and (k - (i + 1)) * s[i], and the sum of pres[i] and rem * s[i], maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged, sb is the sum of all elements in b, ss is the sum of all elements in s, preb is a list containing the cumulative sum of b, pres is a list with at least 3 elements, b is a list with k elements, s is a list with k elements, rem is an integer equal to k - (i + 1), stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `sb`, `ss`, `preb`, `pres`, `b`, `s`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2. The lists `ptsb` and `ptss` have been appended with new elements, which are the sum of `preb[i]` and `rem * b[i]`, and the sum of `pres[i]` and `rem * s[i]`, respectively. The variable `rem` has been assigned the value of `k - (i + 1)`.
