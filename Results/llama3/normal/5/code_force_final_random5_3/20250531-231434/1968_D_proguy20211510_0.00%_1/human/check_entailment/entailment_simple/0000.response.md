Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and move according to certain rules. The goal is to determine who wins the game after a certain number of turns.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, the permutation, and the array. It then initializes variables to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha.

The program checks if the maximum value in the array is equal to the values at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case. If not, it checks if the value at the starting position of Bodya is equal to the maximum value. If so, it prints "Bodya" and continues to the next test case. If not, it checks if the value at the starting position of Sasha is equal to the maximum value. If so, it prints "Sasha" and continues to the next test case.

If none of the above conditions are met, the program simulates the game by iterating over the turns. In each turn, it updates the scores of Bodya and Sasha based on their current positions and the values in the array. It also updates their positions according to the permutation.

After simulating the game, the program calculates the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha by considering all possible moves they could make in the remaining turns. It then compares these maximum scores and prints the result.

The program repeats this process for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
