Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 2, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `foundb` is True, `b` is a list with two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`, and `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` if both `foundb` and `founds` are True. Otherwise, `pb` is equal to the value at index `pb - 1` in list `p`, `b` is a list with an additional element equal to the value at index `pb - 1` in list `a`, and `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` if both `foundb` and `founds` are True. Additionally, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` remain unchanged.**
