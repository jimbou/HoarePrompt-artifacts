Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 1, ptsb is a list containing two elements which are the sum of preb[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * b[i] and the sum of preb[i] and rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing two elements which are the sum of pres[0] and (k - (i + 1)) * s[i] and the sum of pres[i] and rem * s[i], maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged, sb is the sum of all elements in b, ss is the sum of all elements in s, preb is a list containing the cumulative sum of b, pres is a list with at least 2 elements, b is a list with k elements, s is a list with k elements, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet modifies the `ptsb` and `ptss` lists by appending new elements to them. The first line calculates the sum of `preb[i]` and `rem * b[i]`, where `rem` is the result of `k - (i + 1)`, and appends this value to `ptsb`. Similarly, the second line calculates the sum of `pres[i]` and `rem * s[i]` and appends this value to `ptss`. The values of `rem` and `i` are used in these calculations. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
