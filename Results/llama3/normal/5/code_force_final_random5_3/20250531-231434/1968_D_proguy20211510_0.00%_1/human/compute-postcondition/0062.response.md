Postcondition: ***foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list containing six elements: (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and a[pb - 1], s is a list containing four elements: (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, maxa, and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, i is i + 1, k is greater than i + 1. If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, then pb is equal to p[pb - 2]. Otherwise, pb is equal to p[p[pb - 2] - 1]. ps is equal to p[ps - 1].***
