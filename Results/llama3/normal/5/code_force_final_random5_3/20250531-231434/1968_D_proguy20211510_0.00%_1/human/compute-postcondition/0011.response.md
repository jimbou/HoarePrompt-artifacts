Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0. The current value of a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa. Either a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa or both a[pb - 1] and a[ps - 1] are equal to maxa., and 'Bodya' is printed and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we continue to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the code in the current iteration. The values of all variables remain the same, and the program continues to execute the next iteration of the loop.
