Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t, and for each test case, it contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n, and an array a_1,\dots,a_n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxa = max(a)
    if a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Draw')
        continue
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        print('Bodya')
        continue
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Sasha')
        continue
    b, s = [], []
    founds, foundb = False, False
    for i in range(k):
        if foundb and founds:
            b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            break
        if foundb:
            b.append(maxa)
        elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
            foundb = True
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
        else:
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
        if founds:
            s.append(maxa)
        elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
            founds = True
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
        else:
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
    preb, pres = [], []
    sb, ss = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        preb.append(sb + b[i])
        sb += b[i]
        pres.append(ss + s[i])
        ss += s[i]
    ptsb, ptss = [], []
    for i in range(len(pres)):
        rem = k - (i + 1)
        ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
        ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])
    maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)
    if maxs > maxb:
        print('Sasha')
    elif maxs < maxb:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program prints 'Sasha' if the maximum value in ptss is greater than the maximum value in ptsb, 'Bodya' if the maximum value in ptss is less than the maximum value in ptsb, and 'Draw' otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list that must have at least `len(s)` elements, `founds` is a boolean, `foundb` is a boolean, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb` and each element of `b`, `pres` is a list that must have at least `len(s)` elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements of `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements of `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the sum of `preb[i]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for all `i` in range(`len(s)`), `ptss` is a list containing the sum of `pres[i]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for all `i` in range(`len(s)`), `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, 'Sasha' is printed. If `maxs` is less than `maxb`, 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is `k-1`, `ptsb` is a list containing `k` elements which are the sum of `preb[i]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` in range(`k`), `ptss` is a list containing `k` elements which are the sum of `pres[i]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` in range(`k`), `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `b`, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `s`, `b` is a list with `k` elements, `s` is a list with `k` elements, stdin is empty. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, 'Sasha' is printed. If `maxs` is less than `maxb`, 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
