The code `continue` skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables or stdin, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, stdin is empty, and 'Draw' is being printed**
