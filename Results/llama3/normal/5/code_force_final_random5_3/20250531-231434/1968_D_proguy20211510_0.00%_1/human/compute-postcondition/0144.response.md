Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least 2, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list that contains the element `maxa` in addition to its previous elements, `founds` is a boolean, `foundb` is a boolean, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. If `foundb` is True, then `b` contains the element `maxa` in addition to its previous elements. If `foundb` is False, then `b` contains the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a`, and `pb` is the element at index `pb - 1` in list `p`. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `b` contains the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` and `foundb` is True. Otherwise, `pb` is the element at index `pb - 1` in list `p`, `b` contains the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` and the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, then `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `s` now contains the maximum value from list `a` as an additional element. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
