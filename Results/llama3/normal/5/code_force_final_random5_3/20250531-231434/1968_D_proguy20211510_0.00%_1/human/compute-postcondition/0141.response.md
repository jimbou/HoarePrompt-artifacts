Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 2, pb is an integer equal to the element at index pb - 1 in list p, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list containing the element at index pb - 1 in list a and the element at index pb - 1 in list a, s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 1. If foundb and founds are both True, then b and s each have an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

The code block modifies the values of `pb` and `b`. The first line appends the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` to `b`. The second line assigns the value of the element at index `pb - 1` in list `p` to `pb`. The values of `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
