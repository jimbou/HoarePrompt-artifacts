Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list that has an additional element `maxa`, `founds` is True, `foundb` is a boolean, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If `foundb` is True, then `b` has an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, then `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then `b` contains the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a`, and `pb` is the element at index `pb - 1` in list `p`.**

The code adds the maximum value in list `a` to the end of list `s`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
