Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least 1, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 0, stdin is empty, sb is 0, ss is 0, foundb is False, b is a list of integers with an additional element a[pb - 1], s, preb, pres, ptsb, ptss, maxs, maxb remain unchanged. The value of a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa**

In this output state, the value of `pb` has been updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, and the list `b` has been appended with the value of `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
