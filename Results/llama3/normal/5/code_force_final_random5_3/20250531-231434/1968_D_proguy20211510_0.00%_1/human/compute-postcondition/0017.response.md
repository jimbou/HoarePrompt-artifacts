Postcondition: ***YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0. If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, 'Sasha' is printed and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, either a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa or both a[pb - 1] and a[ps - 1] are not equal to maxa, and a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa.***
