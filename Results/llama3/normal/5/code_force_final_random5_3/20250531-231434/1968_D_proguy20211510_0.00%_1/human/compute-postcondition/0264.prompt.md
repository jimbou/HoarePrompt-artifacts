Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is k-1, stdin is empty, sb is 0, ss is 0, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list. If foundb and founds are both True, then b is a list with k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa for i in range k, and s is a list with k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa for i in range k. If foundb is True and founds is False, then b is a list with k elements: maxa repeated k times, and s is a list with k elements: a[ps - 1] repeated k times. If foundb is False and founds is True, then b is a list with k elements: a[pb - 1] repeated k times, and s is a list with k elements: maxa repeated k times. If foundb and founds are both False, then b is a list with k elements: a[pb - 1] repeated k times, and s is a list with k elements: a[ps - 1] repeated k times. In all cases, ptsb, ptss, maxs, and maxb remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is k-1, stdin is empty, sb is sb + b[i-1], ss is ss + s[i-1], preb is a list containing sb + b[i-1], pres is a list containing ss + s[i-1], b is a list with k elements, s is a list with at least 1 element, ptsb is unchanged, ptss is unchanged, maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is k, stdin is empty, sb is sb + b[i-1] + b[i], ss is ss + s[i-1] + s[i], preb is a list containing sb + b[i-1], sb + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i-1], ss + s[i], b is a list with k elements, s is a list with at least 2 elements, ptsb is unchanged, ptss is unchanged, maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is k+1, stdin is empty, sb is sb + b[i-1] + b[i] + b[i], ss is ss + s[i-1] + s[i] + s[i], preb is a list containing sb + b[i-1], sb + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i-1], ss + s[i], ss + s[i] + s[i], b is a list with k elements, s is a list with at least k+1 elements, ptsb is unchanged, ptss is unchanged, maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
