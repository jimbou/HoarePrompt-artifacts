Postcondition: **If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then the program's state is updated such that `b` is a list containing three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `s` is a list containing two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. Otherwise, the program's state remains unchanged.**
