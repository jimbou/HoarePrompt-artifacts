Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, founds is False, foundb is False, stdin is empty.**

The code initializes two empty lists `b` and `s`, and two boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` to `False`. These new variables are added to the state, while the existing variables remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as no input operation is performed.
