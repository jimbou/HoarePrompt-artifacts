Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is k-1, stdin is empty, sb is sb + b[i-1], ss is ss + s[i-1], preb is a list containing sb + b[i-1], pres is a list containing ss + s[i-1], b is a list with k elements, s is a list with at least 1 element, ptsb is unchanged, ptss is unchanged, maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code modifies the values of `sb`, `ss`, `preb`, and `pres`. The value of `sb` is incremented by the value of `b` at index `i-1`, which is the second last element of list `b`. Similarly, the value of `ss` is incremented by the value of `s` at index `i-1`, which is the second last element of list `s`. The list `preb` now contains the value of `sb` plus the value of `b` at index `i-1`, and the list `pres` now contains the value of `ss` plus the value of `s` at index `i-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
