Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least 3, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 2, stdin is empty, sb is 0, ss is 0, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], s is a list of integers, foundb and founds remain unchanged, preb, pres, ptsb, ptss, maxs, and maxb remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `pb` has been updated to `p[pb - 1]`, and the list `b` has been appended with the element `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
