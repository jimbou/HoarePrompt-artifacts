Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the maximum value in the array `a` is not unique. In this case, the program assumes that the player who starts at the position with the maximum value will always win, but this is not necessarily true. If there are multiple positions with the maximum value, the program should consider the entire cycle of positions that each player can visit, not just the starting position.

For example, consider the input:

```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

In this case, the maximum value in the array `a` is 7, which is at position 3. However, the program incorrectly assumes that Bodya will always win because he starts at position 3. But if Sasha starts at position 2, he can move to position 1 and then to position 3, also getting a score of 7. Therefore, the program should output "Draw" in this case, but it incorrectly outputs "Bodya".

This is just one example of how the program can fail to handle cases where the maximum value in the array `a` is not unique. There may be other cases where the program fails as well.
