Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is k - 1, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0. If foundb is True, then b contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements. If foundb is False, then b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a, and pb is the element at index pb - 1 in list p. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a and foundb is True. Otherwise, pb is the element at index pb - 1 in list p, b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a and the element at index pb - 1 in list a. If foundb and founds are both True, then b and s each have an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If founds is True, then s contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements. If founds is False, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a, and ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p. If a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa, then ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p, and s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If foundb and founds are not both True, then b and s are unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list that must have at least 1 element, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 0, preb is a list containing the sum of sb and the first element of b, pres is a list containing the sum of ss and the first element of s, sb is the first element of b, ss is the first element of s.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list that must have at least 2 elements, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 1, preb is a list containing the sum of sb and the first element of b, and the sum of sb and the second element of b, pres is a list containing the sum of ss and the first element of s, and the sum of ss and the second element of s, sb is the sum of the first two elements of b, ss is the sum of the first two elements of s.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list that must have at least 3 elements, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 2, preb is a list containing the sum of sb and the first element of b, the sum of sb and the second element of b, and the sum of sb and the third element of b, pres is a list containing the sum of ss and the first element of s, the sum of ss and the second element of s, and the sum of ss and the third element of s, sb is the sum of the first three elements of b, ss is the sum of the first three elements of s




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
