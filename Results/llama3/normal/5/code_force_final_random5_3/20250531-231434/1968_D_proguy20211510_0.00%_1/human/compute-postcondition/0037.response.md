Postcondition: ***YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is 0. If foundb was True, then b was a list containing two elements which were (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If foundb was False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, founds was True, foundb was True, b was a list containing one element which was (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s was a list containing one element which was (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, pb was equal to p[pb - 1], foundb was False, and b was a list containing one element which was the element at index pb-1 in list a. founds was False. The current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa.***
