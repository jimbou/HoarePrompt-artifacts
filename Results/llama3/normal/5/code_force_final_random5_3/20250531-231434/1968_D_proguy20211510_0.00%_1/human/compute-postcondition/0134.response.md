Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 1, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 0. If foundb is True, then b has an additional element maxa. If foundb is False, then b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a, and pb is the element at index pb - 1 in list p. If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then s contains maxa and founds is True. Otherwise, s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a, and ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p.***
