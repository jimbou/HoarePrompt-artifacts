Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is k-1, ptsb is a list containing k elements which are the sum of preb[i] and (k - (i + 1)) * b[i] for each i in range(k), ptss is a list containing k elements which are the sum of pres[i] and (k - (i + 1)) * s[i] for each i in range(k), maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged, sb is the sum of all elements in b, ss is the sum of all elements in s, preb is a list containing the cumulative sum of b, pres is a list containing the cumulative sum of s, b is a list with k elements, s is a list with k elements, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for most variables as in the initial state. The only changes will be in the variables `i`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`. The variable `i` will be equal to `k-1`, which is the last index of the lists `preb` and `pres`. The lists `ptsb` and `ptss` will contain `k` elements each, where each element is the sum of the corresponding element in `preb` or `pres` and the product of `(k - (i + 1))` and the corresponding element in `b` or `s`, respectively.
