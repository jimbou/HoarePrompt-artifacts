Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list that must have at least `len(s)` elements, `founds` is a boolean, `foundb` is a boolean, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb` and each element of `b`, `pres` is a list containing the sum of `ss` and each element of `s`, `sb` is the sum of all elements of `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements of `s`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of two new variables `ptsb` and `ptss`, which are both empty lists. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
