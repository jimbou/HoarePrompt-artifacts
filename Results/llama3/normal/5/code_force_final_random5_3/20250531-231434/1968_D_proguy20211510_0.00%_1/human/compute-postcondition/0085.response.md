Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is len(s), foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, s is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, pb is equal to either p[pb - 2] or p[p[pb - 2] - 1], ps is equal to either p[ps - 1] if founds is True or either p[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] equals maxa or p[p[ps - 1] - 1] if a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa if founds is False, preb is a list containing len(s) elements: sb + b[i], sb + b[i], ..., sb + b[i], pres is a list containing len(s) elements: ss + s[i], ss + s[i], ..., ss + s[i], sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements: preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + rem * b[i], ..., preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements: pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + rem * s[i], ..., pres[i] + rem * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the following changes:

*   The variable `i` is now equal to `len(s)`, indicating that the loop has executed `len(s)` times.
*   The variable `ptsb` is now a list containing `len(s)` elements, where each element is the result of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for each iteration of the loop.
*   The variable `ptss` is now a list containing `len(s)` elements, where each element is the result of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for each iteration of the loop.
*   The variable `rem` is now equal to `k - (i + 1)`, which is the remaining number of iterations after the loop has executed `len(s)` times.

All other variables remain unchanged.
