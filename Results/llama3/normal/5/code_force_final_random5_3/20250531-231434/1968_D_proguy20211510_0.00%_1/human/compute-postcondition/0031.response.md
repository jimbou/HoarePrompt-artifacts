Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, pb is an integer equal to p[pb - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, foundb is False, b is a list containing one element which is the element at index pb-1 in list a, and i is 0.**

The code modifies the values of `pb` and `b`. The first line appends the element at index `pb-1` in list `a` to list `b`. Since the element at index `pb-1` in list `a` is not equal to `maxa`, this operation does not change the value of `maxa`. The second line assigns the value of `p[pb - 1]` to `pb`. This operation changes the value of `pb` to an integer equal to `p[pb - 1]`. No other variables are affected.
