Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is len(s) - 1, preb is a list containing the sum of sb and each element of b, pres is a list that must have at least len(s) elements, sb is the sum of all elements of b, ss is the sum of all elements of s, ptsb is a list containing the sum of preb[i] and (k - (i + 1)) * b[i] for all i in range(len(s)), ptss is a list containing the sum of pres[i] and (k - (i + 1)) * s[i] for all i in range(len(s)), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb. If a[pb - 1] is equal to a[ps - 1] and both are equal to maxa, then 'Draw' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa but a[ps - 1] is not, then 'Bodya' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If the last element of list a is equal to maxa but a[pb - 1] is not, then 'Sasha' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
