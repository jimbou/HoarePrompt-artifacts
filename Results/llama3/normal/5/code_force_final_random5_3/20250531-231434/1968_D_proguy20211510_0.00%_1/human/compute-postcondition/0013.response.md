Postcondition: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0. Either a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa or both a[pb - 1] and a[ps - 1] are not equal to maxa. Additionally, a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa. The current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa.**
