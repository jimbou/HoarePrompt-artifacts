Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0. Either a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa or both a[pb - 1] and a[ps - 1] are not equal to maxa. Additionally, a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa. The current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, and 'Sasha' is printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. All variables maintain their original values and conditions.
