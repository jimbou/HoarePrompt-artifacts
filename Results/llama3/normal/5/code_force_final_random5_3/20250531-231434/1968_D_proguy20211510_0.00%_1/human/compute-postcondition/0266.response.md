The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and pres, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the pres.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, all the other variables are unchanged. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least `k`, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is unchanged, `maxb` is unchanged, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is a list with `k` elements, `s` is a list with `k` elements, stdin is empty.**
