Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 3, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0. If `founds` is True, then `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `maxa`. If `founds` is False, then if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list with an additional element `maxa`, and `founds` is True, `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, then `b` is a list with an additional element `maxa`, and if both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is set to True, `b` is a list with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, and `b` is a list with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. In all cases, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` remain unchanged.***
