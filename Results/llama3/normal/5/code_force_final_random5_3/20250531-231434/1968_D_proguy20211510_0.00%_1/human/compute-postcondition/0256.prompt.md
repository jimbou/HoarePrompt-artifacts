Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, founds is False, foundb is False, stdin is empty, i is len(s) - 1, preb is an empty list, pres is a list that must have at least len(s) elements, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, maxs is undefined, maxb is undefined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0. If `founds` is True, then `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `maxa`, `foundb` is either True or False, and `b` is either a list with two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` if `foundb` is True, or a list of integers with an additional element `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is False. If `founds` is False, then if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `founds` is True and `s` is a list with one element: `maxa`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`, `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[ps - 1]`, and `founds` is False. In all cases, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list with two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` if `foundb` was True, otherwise `b` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. Additionally, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least 2, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 1, stdin is empty, sb is 0, ss is 0. If foundb is True, then b is a list with two elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If both foundb and founds are True, then s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with two elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa, and s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if both foundb and founds are True. Otherwise, pb is equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list p, b is a list with an additional element equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list a, and s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if both foundb and founds are True. Additionally, preb, pres, ptsb, ptss, maxs, and maxb remain unchanged. If founds is True, then s is a list of integers with an additional element maxa. If founds is False, then if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, founds is True, and s has an additional element equal to a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, ps is the value at index ps - 1 in list p.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 3, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0. If `founds` is True, then `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `maxa`. If `founds` is False, then if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is True, `b` is a list with an additional element `maxa`, and `founds` is True, `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, then `b` is a list with an additional element `maxa`, and if both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is set to True, `b` is a list with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, and `b` is a list with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. In all cases, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
