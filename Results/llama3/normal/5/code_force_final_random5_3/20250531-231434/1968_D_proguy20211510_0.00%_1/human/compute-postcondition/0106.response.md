The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, stdin is empty, and 'Bodya' is being printed, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
