Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0**

The code reads four integers from stdin and assigns them to n, k, pb, and ps. It then reads a permutation p and an array a from stdin. The maximum value in array a is assigned to maxa. The values of YES, NO, MOD, alpha, and _ remain unchanged. The number of test cases t in stdin is not affected by the code.
