Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 2, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `b` is a list with two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `foundb` is True. Otherwise, the values of `s`, `foundb` remain unchanged. Additionally, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `i`, `stdin`, `sb`, `ss`, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs` remain unchanged. The list `b` now has an additional element `maxa`. If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then the list `s` also has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `foundb` is True. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `foundb` remain unchanged.
