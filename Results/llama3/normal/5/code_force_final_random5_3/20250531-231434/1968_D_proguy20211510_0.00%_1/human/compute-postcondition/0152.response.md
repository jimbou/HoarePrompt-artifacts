Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 3, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list that contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements, s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean that is True, stdin is empty, i is 2. If foundb and founds are both True, then b and s each have an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If founds is True, then s contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements. If founds is False, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a, and ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p. If a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa, then ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p, and s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If foundb and founds are not both True, then s is unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 3, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list that contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements, s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean that is True, stdin is empty, i is 2. If foundb and founds are both True, then b and s each have an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If founds is True, then s contains the element maxa in addition to its previous elements. If founds is False, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a, and ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p. If a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa, then ps is the element at index ps - 1 in list p, and s contains the element at index ps - 1 in list a. If foundb and founds are not both True, then s is unchanged.
