To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, we can't make any assumptions about `k` based on `n`. However, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable in a `range` loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
