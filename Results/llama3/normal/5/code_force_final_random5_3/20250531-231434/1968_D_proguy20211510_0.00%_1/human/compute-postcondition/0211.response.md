Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0. If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `b` and `s` are lists with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, `preb` is a list, `pres` is a list that must have at least len(s) elements, `ptsb` is a list, `ptss` is a list, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined. Otherwise, the values of `b`, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb` remain unchanged.***
