Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least 1, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 0, stdin is empty, sb is 0, ss is 0. If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list containing the value of a[pb - 1]. Otherwise, foundb is False, pb is updated to the value of p[pb - 1], and b is a list of integers with an additional element a[pb - 1]. In both cases, s, preb, pres, ptsb, ptss, maxs, maxb remain unchanged.***
