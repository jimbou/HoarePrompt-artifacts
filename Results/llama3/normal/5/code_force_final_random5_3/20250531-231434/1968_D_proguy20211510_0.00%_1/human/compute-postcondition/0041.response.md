Postcondition: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is 0. If foundb is True, then b is a list containing two elements which are (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, pb is equal to p[pb - 1], foundb is False, and b is a list containing one element which is the element at index pb-1 in list a. founds is False. If a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then founds is True, s is a list containing two elements which were (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. Otherwise, the element at index ps-1 in list a is not equal to maxa, s is a list containing one element which is the element at index ps-1 in list a, and ps is equal to p[ps - 1].**
