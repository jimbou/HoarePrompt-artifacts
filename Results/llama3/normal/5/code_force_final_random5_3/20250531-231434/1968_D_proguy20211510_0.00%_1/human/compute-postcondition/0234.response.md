Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least 2, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 1, stdin is empty, sb is 0, ss is 0, foundb is True, b is a list with two elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa, s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, preb, pres, ptsb, ptss, maxs, and maxb remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `foundb` is set to True. The list `b` is modified by appending the value of `a[pb - 1]`, which is the element at index `pb - 1` in the list `a`. The list `s` is also modified by adding an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `i`, `stdin`, `sb`, `ss`, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` remain unchanged.
