Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and i is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `foundb` has been updated to `True`. The list `b` now contains one element, which is the value of `a[pb - 1]`, and since `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, the element in `b` is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
