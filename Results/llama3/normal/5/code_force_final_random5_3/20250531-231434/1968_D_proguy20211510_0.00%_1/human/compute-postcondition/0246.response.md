Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 3, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `b` is a list with an additional element `maxa`, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` remain unchanged, and if both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by appending the maximum value of `a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, except for `s` which may have an additional element if both `foundb` and `founds` are True.
