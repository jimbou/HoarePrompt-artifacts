Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 2, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list containing the element at index pb - 1 in list a and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list containing the element at index ps - 1 in list a and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 1.**

The code appends `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to both list `b` and list `s`. Since `i` is 1, `(k - (i + 1))` equals `(k - 2)`. The value of `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`. 

The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb`, and `stdin` are not affected by the code.
