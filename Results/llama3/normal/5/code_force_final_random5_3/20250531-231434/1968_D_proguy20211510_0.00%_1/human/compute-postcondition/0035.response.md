Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is 0. If foundb was True, then the current value of b is a list containing two elements which are (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If foundb was False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, the current value of founds is True, the current value of foundb is True, the current value of b is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and the current value of s is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. Otherwise, the current value of pb is equal to p[pb - 1], the current value of foundb is False, and the current value of b is a list containing one element which is the element at index pb-1 in list a. The current value of founds is True and s is a list containing one element which is the element at index pb-1 in list a and maxa.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `s` has been appended with the value of `maxa`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
