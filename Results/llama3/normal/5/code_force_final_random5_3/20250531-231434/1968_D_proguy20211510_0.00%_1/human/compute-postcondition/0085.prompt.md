Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is len(s), foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, s is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, pb is equal to either p[pb - 2] or p[p[pb - 2] - 1], ps is equal to either p[ps - 1] if founds is True or either p[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] equals maxa or p[p[ps - 1] - 1] if a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa if founds is False, preb is a list containing len(s) elements: sb + b[i], sb + b[i], ..., sb + b[i], pres is a list containing len(s) elements: ss + s[i], ss + s[i], ..., ss + s[i], sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pres)):
    rem = k - (i + 1)
    ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
    ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is 0, foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, s is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, pb is equal to either p[pb - 2] or p[p[pb - 2] - 1], ps is equal to either p[ps - 1] if founds is True or either p[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] equals maxa or p[p[ps - 1] - 1] if a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa if founds is False, preb is a list containing len(s) elements: sb + b[i], sb + b[i], ..., sb + b[i], pres is a list containing at least 1 element: ss + s[i], ss + s[i], ..., ss + s[i], sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing one element: preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing one element: pres[i] + rem * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is 1, foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, s is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, pb is equal to either p[pb - 2] or p[p[pb - 2] - 1], ps is equal to either p[ps - 1] if founds is True or either p[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] equals maxa or p[p[ps - 1] - 1] if a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa if founds is False, preb is a list containing len(s) elements: sb + b[i], sb + b[i], ..., sb + b[i], pres is a list containing at least 2 elements: ss + s[i], ss + s[i], ..., ss + s[i], sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing two elements: preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing two elements: pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + rem * s[i], rem is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is 2, foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, s is a list containing 2k elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, ..., (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, pb is equal to either p[pb - 2] or p[p[pb - 2] - 1], ps is equal to either p[ps - 1] if founds is True or either p[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] equals maxa or p[p[ps - 1] - 1] if a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa if founds is False, preb is a list containing len(s) elements: sb + b[i], sb + b[i], ..., sb + b[i], pres is a list containing at least 3 elements: ss + s[i], ss + s[i], ..., ss + s[i], sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing three elements: preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing three elements: pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + rem * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
