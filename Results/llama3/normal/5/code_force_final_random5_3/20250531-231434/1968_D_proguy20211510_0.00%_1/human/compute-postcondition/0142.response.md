Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be at least 2, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, b is a list, s is a list, founds is a boolean, foundb is a boolean, stdin is empty, i is 1. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a and foundb is True. Otherwise, pb is the element at index pb - 1 in list p, b contains the element at index pb - 1 in list a and the element at index pb - 1 in list a. If foundb and founds are both True, then b and s each have an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.***
