Output State: **founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list containing five elements: (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list containing four elements: (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, maxa, and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, pb is equal to p[pb - 2], ps is equal to p[ps - 1], i is i + 1, k is greater than i + 1**

The code snippet appends a new element to both lists `b` and `s`, and then breaks out of the loop. The new element appended to both lists is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The values of `founds`, `foundb`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `k` remains greater than `i + 1`.
