Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, founds is False, foundb is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is 0. If foundb was True, then the current value of b is a list containing two elements which are (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If foundb was False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, the current value of founds is True, the current value of foundb is True, the current value of b is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and the current value of s is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. Otherwise, the current value of pb is equal to p[pb - 1], the current value of foundb is False, and the current value of b is a list containing one element which is the element at index pb-1 in list a. The current value of founds is True and s is a list containing one element which is the element at index pb-1 in list a and maxa. If founds was False, then if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then founds is True, s is a list containing two elements which were (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. Otherwise, the element at index ps-1 in list a is not equal to maxa, s is a list containing one element which is the element at index ps-1 in list a, and ps is equal to p[ps - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *If `founds` is True, then if `foundb` is also True, `b` is a list containing four elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `maxa`, and `s` is a list containing three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, `foundb` is set to True, `b` is a list containing four elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` is a list containing three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` does not equal `maxa` but both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `b` is a list containing four elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 2]`, and `s` is a list containing three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `maxa`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing one element: `a[pb - 2]`, and `s` is a list containing three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `maxa`. If `founds` is False, then if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, then if `foundb` is True, `s` is a list containing three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is False, then `s` is a list containing one element: `a[ps - 1]`. In all cases, `founds` is True, and `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 2]`. If `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, then if `foundb` is True, if `founds` is also True, `b` is a list containing four elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `maxa`, and `s` is a list containing three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, the program's state remains unchanged. If `foundb` is False, then if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, `foundb` is set to True, `b` is a list containing four elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` is a list containing three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1]` does not equal `maxa` but both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `b` is a list containing four elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `a[pb - 2]`, and `s` is a list containing three elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing one element: `a[pb - 2]`, and `s` is a list containing one element: `a[ps - 1]`. In all cases, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 2]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list containing six elements: (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and either maxa or a[pb - 1], s is a list containing five elements: (k - (i + 2)) * maxa, maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and either maxa if founds is True or either a[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] equals maxa or a[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa if founds is False, pb is equal to either p[pb - 2] or p[p[pb - 2] - 1], ps is equal to either p[ps - 1] if founds is True or either p[ps - 1] if a[ps - 1] equals maxa or p[p[ps - 1] - 1] if a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa if founds is False, i is i + 1, k is greater than i + 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
