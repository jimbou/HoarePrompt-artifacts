Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, foundb is True, b is a list containing two elements which are (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa, and the current value of i is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list b now contains two elements: the original element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and the newly appended element maxa.
