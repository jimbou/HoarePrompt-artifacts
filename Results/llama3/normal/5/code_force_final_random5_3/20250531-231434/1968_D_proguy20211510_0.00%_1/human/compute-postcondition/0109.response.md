Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, stdin is empty, and 'Sasha' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables n, k, pb, ps, p, a, and maxa remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty, and 'Sasha' is still being printed. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop due to the continue statement.
