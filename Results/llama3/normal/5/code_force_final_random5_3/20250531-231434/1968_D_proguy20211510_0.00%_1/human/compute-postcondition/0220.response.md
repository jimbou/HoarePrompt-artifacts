Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0. If `foundb` is True, then `b` is a list with two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, then if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is True and `b` is a list containing the value of `a[pb - 1]`. Otherwise, `foundb` is False, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, and `b` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. In all cases, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb` remain unchanged.**
