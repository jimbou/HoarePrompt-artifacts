Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, b is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, founds is True, foundb is True, and i is 0.**

The code block modifies the initial state by appending a new element to the lists `b` and `s`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, where `k` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `maxa` is an integer. Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(k - 1) * maxa`. This value is appended to both `b` and `s`, resulting in each list containing one element. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
