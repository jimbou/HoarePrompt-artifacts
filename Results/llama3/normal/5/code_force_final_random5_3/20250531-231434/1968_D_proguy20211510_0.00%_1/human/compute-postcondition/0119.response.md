Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list with an additional element `maxa`, `s` is a list, `founds` is a boolean, `foundb` is True, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If `founds` is also True, then `b` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, `stdin`, and `i` remains the same. The list `b` now has an additional element which is the maximum value in list `a`. If `founds` is True, then both `b` and `s` have an additional element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.
