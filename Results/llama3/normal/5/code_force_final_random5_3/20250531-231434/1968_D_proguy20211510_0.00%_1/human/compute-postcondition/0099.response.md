The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_` and the input value. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the input value is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input value must be greater than 1.
State: **The program prints 'Sasha' if the maximum value in ptss is greater than the maximum value in ptsb, 'Bodya' if the maximum value in ptss is less than the maximum value in ptsb, and 'Draw' otherwise, input value is greater than 1**
