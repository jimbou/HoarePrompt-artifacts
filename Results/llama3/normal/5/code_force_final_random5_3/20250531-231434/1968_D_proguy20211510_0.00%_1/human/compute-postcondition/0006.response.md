Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0. The current value of a[pb - 1] and a[ps - 1] are equal to maxa, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of all variables remain the same, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
