Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string 'Draw'.

The variables and objects in the precondition do not affect the output of the print statement, as it simply prints a fixed string 'Draw'. The values of variables such as YES, NO, MOD, alpha, stdin, t, n, k, p, a, maxa, _, i, foundb, founds, b, s, pb, ps, preb, pres, sb, ss, ptsb, ptss, rem, maxs, and maxb do not influence the output of the print statement.

Output: **Draw**
