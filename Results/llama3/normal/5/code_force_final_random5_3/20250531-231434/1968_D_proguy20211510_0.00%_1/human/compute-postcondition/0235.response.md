Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least 2, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list p, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 1, stdin is empty, sb is 0, ss is 0, b is a list with an additional element equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list a, foundb is True, s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if both foundb and founds are True, preb, pres, ptsb, ptss, maxs, and maxb remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of pb has been updated to the value at index pb - 1 in list p. The list b has been appended with the value at index pb - 1 in list a. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
