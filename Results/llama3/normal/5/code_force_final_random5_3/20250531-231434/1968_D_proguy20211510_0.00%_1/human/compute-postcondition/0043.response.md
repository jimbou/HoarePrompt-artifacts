The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that is greater than 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, i is 1. If foundb was True, then the current value of b is a list containing two elements which are (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If foundb was False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, the current value of founds is True, the current value of foundb is True, the current value of b is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and the current value of s is a list containing one element which is (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. Otherwise, the current value of pb is equal to p[pb - 1], the current value of foundb is False, and the current value of b is a list containing one element which is the element at index pb-1 in list a. The current value of founds is True and s is a list containing one element which is the element at index pb-1 in list a and maxa. If founds was False, then if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then founds is True, s is a list containing two elements which were (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. Otherwise, the element at index ps-1 in list a is not equal to maxa, s is a list containing one element which is the element at index ps-1 in list a, and ps is equal to p[ps - 1].**
