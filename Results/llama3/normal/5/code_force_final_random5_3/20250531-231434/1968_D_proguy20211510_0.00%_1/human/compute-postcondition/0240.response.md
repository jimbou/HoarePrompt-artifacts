Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least 2, pb is an integer, ps is the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is 1, stdin is empty, sb is 0, ss is 0. If foundb is True, then b is a list with two elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If both foundb and founds are True, then s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and the value at index ps - 1 in list a. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with two elements: (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa, and s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if both foundb and founds are True. Otherwise, pb is equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list p, b is a list with an additional element equal to the value at index pb - 1 in list a, and s is a list of integers with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if both foundb and founds are True. Additionally, preb, pres, ptsb, ptss, maxs, and maxb remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ps` has been updated to the value at index `ps - 1` in list `p`. The list `s` has been appended with the value at index `ps - 1` in list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
