Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to determine the winner of a game between two players, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', based on the maximum value of their respective scores. The scores are calculated by iterating through a permutation and an array. The program takes into account the possibility that one player may stay at the same position and accumulate the same score, while the other player moves to a different position and accumulates a different score.

The program first checks if the maximum score of both players is the same, in which case it prints 'Draw'. If the maximum score of 'Bodya' is greater than the maximum score of 'Sasha', it prints 'Bodya'. If the maximum score of 'Sasha' is greater than the maximum score of 'Bodya', it prints 'Sasha'.

The program uses a loop to iterate through the permutation and array, and it uses lists to store the scores of both players. It also uses variables to keep track of the maximum score of both players.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the rules of the game and correctly determines the winner based on the maximum score of both players.

Correctness: **True**
