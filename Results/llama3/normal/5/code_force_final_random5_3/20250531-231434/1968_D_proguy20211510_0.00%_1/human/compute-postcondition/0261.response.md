Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer that must be at least k, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer equal to the maximum value in a, i is k, stdin is empty, sb is sb + b[i-1] + b[i], ss is ss + s[i-1] + s[i], preb is a list containing sb + b[i-1], sb + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i-1], ss + s[i], b is a list with k elements, s is a list with at least 2 elements, ptsb is unchanged, ptss is unchanged, maxs is unchanged, maxb is unchanged**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `i`, `stdin`, `b`, `s`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` remain unchanged. The code only modifies the values of `sb`, `ss`, `preb`, and `pres`. The value of `sb` is incremented by `b[i]`, and the value of `ss` is incremented by `s[i]`. The lists `preb` and `pres` are appended with the updated values of `sb` and `ss`, respectively.
