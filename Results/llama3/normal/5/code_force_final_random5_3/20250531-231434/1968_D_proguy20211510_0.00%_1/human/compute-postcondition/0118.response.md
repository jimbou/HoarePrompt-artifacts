Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list, `s` is a list, `founds` is a boolean, `foundb` is True, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0. If `founds` is also True, then `b` and `s` each have an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**
