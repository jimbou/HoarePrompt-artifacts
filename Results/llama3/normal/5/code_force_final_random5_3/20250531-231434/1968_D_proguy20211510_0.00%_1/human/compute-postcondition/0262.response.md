The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `s`. If `i` is less than `len(s)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k`, `s` is a list with at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `k+1`, and `s` must have at least `k+1` elements.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer that must be at least k, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is an integer equal to the maximum value in `a`, `i` is `k+1`, `stdin` is empty, `sb` is `sb + b[i-1] + b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i-1] + s[i]`, `preb` is a list containing `sb + b[i-1]`, `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing `ss + s[i-1]`, `ss + s[i]`, `b` is a list with `k` elements, `s` is a list with at least `k+1` elements, `ptsb` is unchanged, `ptss` is unchanged, `maxs` is unchanged, `maxb` is unchanged**
