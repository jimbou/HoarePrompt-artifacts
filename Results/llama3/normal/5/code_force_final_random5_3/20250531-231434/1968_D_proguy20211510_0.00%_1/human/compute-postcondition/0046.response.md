Output State: **If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `b` is a list containing four elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa`, `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `maxa`, and `s` is a list containing two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. Otherwise, the program's state remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the code has appended `maxa` to the list `b` if both `foundb` and `founds` are True. The list `b` now contains four elements, and the list `s` remains unchanged with two elements. If both `foundb` and `founds` are not True, the program's state remains the same as the initial state.
