Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains a number of test cases t that is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is an integer, _ is 0, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, founds is False, foundb is False**

The code initializes two empty lists, `b` and `s`, and two boolean variables, `founds` and `foundb`, to `False`. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
