Output State: **`a` is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers, for all `j` in range(0, `a` - 2), the current value of `b[j]` is 0, the current value of `b[a - 1]` is `b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0] - 2 * b[i]`, the current value of `b[a - 2]` is `b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0] - b[i]`, `b[i]` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 3, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
