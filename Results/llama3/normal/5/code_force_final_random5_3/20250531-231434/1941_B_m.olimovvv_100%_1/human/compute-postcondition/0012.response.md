Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 1, i is 1, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the `break` statement. The stdin still contains test cases, but the number of test cases is reduced by 1, since we break out of the loop. The value of `i` remains 1, and 'NO' is still being printed. The `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
