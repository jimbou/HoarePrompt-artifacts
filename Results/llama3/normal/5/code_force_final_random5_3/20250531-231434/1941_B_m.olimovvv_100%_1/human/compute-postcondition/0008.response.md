Output State: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 1, i is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `b` is modified by the code, with each element `b[i]` being subtracted from `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]`, and then `b[i]` is set to 0. This means that the values in `b` can now range from `-2 * 10^9` to `10^9` inclusive, as the subtraction operations can result in negative values. The state of `stdin` and `t` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code.
