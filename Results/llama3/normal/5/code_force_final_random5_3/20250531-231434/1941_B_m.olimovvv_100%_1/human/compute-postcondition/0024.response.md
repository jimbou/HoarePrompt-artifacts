To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 2, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, we know that `a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, which means `a` is already at least 2. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop can execute. Since the loop iterates from 0 to `a - 2`, we need to set `i` to 0.

State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `t` is at least 2, `i` is 0, for all `j` in range(0, `a - 2`), `b[j]` is 0, `b[a - 1]` is `b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0]`, `b[a - 2]` is `b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0]`**
