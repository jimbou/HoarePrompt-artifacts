Output State: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers, for all j in range(0, a - 2), the current value of b[j] is 0, the current value of b[a - 1] is b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0] - 2 * b[i], the current value of b[a - 2] is b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0] - b[i], b[i] is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 3, i is 1.**

The code modifies the list `b` by updating the values of `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `b[i]`. The value of `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of `b[i]`, the value of `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`, and the value of `b[i]` is set to 0. The value of `a` and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1.
