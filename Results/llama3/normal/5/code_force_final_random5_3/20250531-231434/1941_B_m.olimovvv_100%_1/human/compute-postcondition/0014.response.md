Output State: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 1, i is 1, b[i + 1] is b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i], b[i + 2] is b[i + 2] - b[i], b[i] is 0.**

The code modifies the list `b` by updating the values at indices `i + 1`, `i + 2`, and `i`. The value at index `i + 1` is decreased by twice the value at index `i`, the value at index `i + 2` is decreased by the value at index `i`, and the value at index `i` is set to 0. The rest of the variables and the state of the input remain unchanged.
