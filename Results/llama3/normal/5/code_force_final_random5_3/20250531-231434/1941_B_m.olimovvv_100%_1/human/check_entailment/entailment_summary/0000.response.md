Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It iterates through the array from the first element to the third last element (inclusive).
2. For each element, it subtracts twice the value of the current element from the next element and subtracts the value of the current element from the element after that. This is equivalent to applying the operation described in the problem statement.
3. After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero. If they are zero, it prints 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct because it simulates the operations described in the problem statement and checks the condition for making all elements of the array equal to zero.

Correctness: **True**
