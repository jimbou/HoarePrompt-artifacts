Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `t` is at least 2, `i` is 0, for all `j` in range(0, `a - 2`), the current value of `b[j]` is 0, the current value of `b[a - 1]` is `b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0]`, the current value of `b[a - 2]` is `b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0]`, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than 0, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `b` still has the same properties, with the first `a-2` elements being 0, and the last two elements being adjusted based on the value of `b[0]`. The value of `b[i]` is still less than 0, and 'NO' is still printed.
