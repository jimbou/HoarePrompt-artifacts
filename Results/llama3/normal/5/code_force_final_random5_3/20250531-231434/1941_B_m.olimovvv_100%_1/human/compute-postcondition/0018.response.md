Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `t` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, `b[i]` is 0, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `t`, `i`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `b[i]` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the current loop or if statement.
