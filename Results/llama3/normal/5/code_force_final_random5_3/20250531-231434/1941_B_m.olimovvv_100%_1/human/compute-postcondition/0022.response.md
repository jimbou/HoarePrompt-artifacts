The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, so for the loop to execute again `t` must be at least 2. 
State: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 2, i is a - 2, for all j in range(0, a - 2), b[j] is 0, b[a - 1] is b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0], b[a - 2] is b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0]**
