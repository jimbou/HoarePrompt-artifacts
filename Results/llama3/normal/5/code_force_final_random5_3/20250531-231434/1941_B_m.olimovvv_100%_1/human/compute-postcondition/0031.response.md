The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be at least 4.
State: **`a` is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1]` - 2 * `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2]` - `b[i]`, for all `j` in range(0, `a - 2`), the current value of `b[j]` is 0, the current value of `b[a - 1]` is `b[a - 1]` - (`a - 2`) * `b[0]`, the current value of `b[a - 2]` is `b[a - 2]` - (`a - 3`) * `b[0]`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
