Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but the correct output is "NO". The reason is that the program does not correctly handle the case where the first element is 1 and the second element is 3. In this case, the program will subtract 2 from the second element, making it 1, and then subtract 1 from the third element, making it 4. However, the program does not check if the resulting array can be made zero using the described operations.

In this case, the resulting array is [1, 1, 4, 5, 2], which cannot be made zero using the described operations. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input.

Note that the program only checks if the last two elements are zero, but it does not check if the resulting array can be made zero using the described operations. This is the reason why the program is incorrect.
