The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `stdin` contains at least one more test case the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `t` is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time `stdin` must contain `t-2` test cases and `_` is not used in the loop body so we don't need to adjust it.
State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers, for all `j` in range(0, `a` - 2), the current value of `b[j]` is 0, the current value of `b[a - 1]` is `b[a - 1]` - (`a` - 2) * `b[0]`, the current value of `b[a - 2]` is `b[a - 2]` - (`a` - 3) * `b[0]`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `t` is at least 2, `i` is `a - 2**
