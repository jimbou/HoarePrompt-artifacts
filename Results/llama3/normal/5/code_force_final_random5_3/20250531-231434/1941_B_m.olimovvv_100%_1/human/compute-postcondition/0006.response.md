Output State: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 1, i is 0, and the current value of b[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of a, b, t, and i remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases because we have already processed one test case and broken out of the loop. The current value of b[i] is still less than 0, and 'NO' is still printed. We have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
