To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `a - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.

To make the loop execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `a` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `t` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, `b[i]` is 0**
