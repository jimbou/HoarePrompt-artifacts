Output State: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 1, i is a - 2, for all j in range(0, a - 2), b[j] is 0, b[a - 1] is b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0], b[a - 2] is b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached its final value of `a - 2`, and the list `b` has been modified such that all elements up to `a - 2` are 0, and the last two elements `b[a - 1]` and `b[a - 2]` have been updated based on the initial values of `b[0]` and the number of iterations `a - 2`. The other variables `a`, `t`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
