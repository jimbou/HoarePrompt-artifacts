Postcondition: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `t` is at least 2, `i` is 0, for all `j` in range(0, `a - 2`), the current value of `b[j]` is 0, the current value of `b[a - 1]` is `b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0]`, the current value of `b[a - 2]` is `b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0]`. If the current value of `b[i]` is less than 0, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
