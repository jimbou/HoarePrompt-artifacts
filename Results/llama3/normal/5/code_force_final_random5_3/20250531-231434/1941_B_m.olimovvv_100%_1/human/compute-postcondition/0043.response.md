Output State: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers, for all j in range(0, a - 2), the current value of b[j] is 0, the current value of b[a - 1] is b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0], the current value of b[a - 2] is b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0], stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 2, i is a - 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of 'a' remains the same, 'b' is a list of 'a' integers, and all elements in 'b' except the last two are 0. The last two elements of 'b' have been updated based on the initial values of 'b' and 'a'. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as 'stdin' and 't', remains unchanged.
