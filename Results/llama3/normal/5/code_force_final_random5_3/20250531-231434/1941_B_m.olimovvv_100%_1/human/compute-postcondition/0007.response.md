Postcondition: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 1, i is 0. If the current value of b[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration.**
