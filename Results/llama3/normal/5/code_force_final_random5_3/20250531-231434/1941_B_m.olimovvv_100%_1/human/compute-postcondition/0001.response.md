Output State: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 1**

In this output state, the value of `a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, which is the number of integers in the list `b`. The list `b` contains `a` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, which are the input values for the current test case. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The value of `t` is at least 1, indicating that there is at least one test case remaining.
