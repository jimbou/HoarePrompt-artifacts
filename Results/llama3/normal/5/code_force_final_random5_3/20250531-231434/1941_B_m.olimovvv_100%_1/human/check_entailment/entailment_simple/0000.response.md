Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The program iterates over the array from left to right, and for each element, it subtracts twice the current element from the next element and subtracts the current element from the element after the next. This is equivalent to applying the operation at the current index.

The program also checks if any element becomes negative during this process, in which case it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are not, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

This logic is correct because the operation can only decrease the values of the elements, and the only way to make all elements zero is to apply the operation at each index the correct number of times. The program correctly simulates this process and checks the final state of the array.

Correctness: **True**
