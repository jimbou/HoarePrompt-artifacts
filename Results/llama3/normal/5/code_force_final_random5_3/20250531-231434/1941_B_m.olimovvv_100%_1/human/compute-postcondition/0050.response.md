Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers, for all `j` in range(0, `a` - 2), the current value of `b[j]` is 0, the current value of `b[a - 1]` is `b[a - 1]` - (`a` - 2) * `b[0]`, the current value of `b[a - 2]` is `b[a - 2]` - (`a` - 3) * `b[0]`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `t` is at least 3, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
