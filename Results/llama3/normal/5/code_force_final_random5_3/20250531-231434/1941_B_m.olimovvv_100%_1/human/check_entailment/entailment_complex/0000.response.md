Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the current element, 2 from the next element, and 1 from the element after that.

The program iterates through the array from the first element to the third last element. For each element, it subtracts twice the current element's value from the next element and subtracts the current element's value from the element after that. This effectively applies the operation to the current element.

After iterating through the array, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES', indicating that Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately simulates the operation described in the problem. By subtracting twice the current element's value from the next element and subtracting the current element's value from the element after that, the program effectively applies the operation to the current element. The final check for the last two elements being zero is also correct, as this is the condition for Rudolf to make all elements of the array equal to zero.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
