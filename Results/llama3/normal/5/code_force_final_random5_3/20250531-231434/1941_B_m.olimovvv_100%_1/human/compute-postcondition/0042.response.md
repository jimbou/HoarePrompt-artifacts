Output State: **a is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers. b[i] is 0, b[i + 1] is b[i + 1] - 3 * b[i], b[i + 2] is b[i + 2] - b[i], for all j in range(0, a - 2), the current value of b[j] is 0, the current value of b[a - 1] is b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0], the current value of b[a - 2] is b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0], stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 2, i is 2.**

Explanation:
The code modifies the list `b` by performing operations on its elements. The first line subtracts twice the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`. The second line subtracts the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`. The third line subtracts the value of `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0.

As a result, `b[i]` becomes 0, and `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` are updated accordingly. The values of `b[j]` for `j` in range(0, `a` - 2) are not affected by the code. The values of `b[a - 1]` and `b[a - 2]` are also updated based on the previous values of `b[0]` and the value of `a`.

The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. The value of `a` is still an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and `stdin` still contains `t-3` test cases. The value of `t` is at least 2, and `i` is still 2.
