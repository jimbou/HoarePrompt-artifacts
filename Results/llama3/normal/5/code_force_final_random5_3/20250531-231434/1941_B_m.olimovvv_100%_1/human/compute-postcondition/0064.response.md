Output State: **a is an integer between 5 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers. If b[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, for all j in range(0, a - 2), the current value of b[j] is 0, the current value of b[a - 1] is b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0] - 2 * b[i], the current value of b[a - 2] is b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0] - b[i], b[i] is 0, b[i + 1] is b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i], b[i + 2] is b[i + 2] - b[i], i is 3, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 3.**
