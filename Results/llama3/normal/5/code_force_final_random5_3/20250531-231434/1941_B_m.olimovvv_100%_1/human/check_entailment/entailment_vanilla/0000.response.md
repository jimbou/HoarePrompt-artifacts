Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the array and applying the operation in reverse. It subtracts twice the current element from the next element and subtracts the current element from the element after that. This process is repeated until the second last element is reached.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The program does not handle the case where the array has less than 3 elements correctly. In such cases, the program will not print anything, whereas it should print "NO" because it is not possible to make all elements zero using the given operation.

2. The program does not check if the elements of the array are non-negative after applying the operation. If any element becomes negative, it is not possible to make all elements zero using the given operation.

3. The program only checks if the last two elements are zero at the end. However, it does not guarantee that the rest of the elements are zero.

4. The program does not handle the case where the input array is empty correctly. In such cases, the program will throw an error, whereas it should print "NO" because it is not possible to make all elements zero using the given operation.

Correctness: **False**
