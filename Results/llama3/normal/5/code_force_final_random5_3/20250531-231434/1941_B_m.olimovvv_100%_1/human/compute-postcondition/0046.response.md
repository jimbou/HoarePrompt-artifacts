To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to `a - 2`, we need to adjust the state of `a` to ensure that `a` is at least 2.

State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `b` is a list of `a` integers, for all `j` in range(0, `a` - 2), the current value of `b[j]` is 0, the current value of `b[a - 1]` is `b[a - 1]` - (`a` - 2) * `b[0]`, the current value of `b[a - 2]` is `b[a - 2]` - (`a` - 3) * `b[0]`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `t` is at least 3, `i` is 1**
