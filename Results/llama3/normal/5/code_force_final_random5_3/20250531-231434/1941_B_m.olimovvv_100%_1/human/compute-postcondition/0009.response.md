The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `a` must be at least 3.
State: **a is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers between -2 * 10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 1, i is 1**
