Output State: **a is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, b is a list of a integers, for all j in range(0, a - 2), the current value of b[j] is 0, the current value of b[a - 1] is b[a - 1] - (a - 2) * b[0] - 2 * b[i], the current value of b[a - 2] is b[a - 2] - (a - 3) * b[0] - b[i], b[i] is 0, b[i + 1] is b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i], b[i + 2] is b[i + 2] - b[i], i is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, t is at least 3.**

The code modifies the list `b` by updating the values of `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `b[i]`. Since `b[i]` is initially 0, the subtraction of `b[i]` from `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` does not change their values. The value of `b[i]` is then set to 0, which does not change its initial value. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
