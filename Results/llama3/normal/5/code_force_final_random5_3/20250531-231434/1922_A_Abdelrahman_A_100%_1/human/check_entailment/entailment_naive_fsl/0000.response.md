Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the strings a and b are identical, but the string c is different from a and b. In this case, the program will print 'NO' because it checks if c is equal to a or b, but it should print 'YES' because there exists a template t that matches a and b but not c.

For example, if the input is:

3
aaa
aaa
abc

The program will print 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because the template 'AAA' matches 'aaa' and 'aaa' but not 'abc'.
