Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `no` is True, `counter` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `no` is False if the first character `x` of string `c` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, otherwise `no` is True, `counter` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, `x` is the first character in the string `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `no` is False if the second character `x` of string `c` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, otherwise `no` is True, `counter` is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, `x` is the second character in the string `c`. If `x` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `no` is False if the third character `x` of string `c` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, otherwise `no` is True, `counter` is 3, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, `x` is the third character in the string `c`. If `x` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
