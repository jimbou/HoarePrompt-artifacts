This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. It then checks if string c can be formed by taking characters from strings a and b, where each character in c must be present in either the corresponding position in a or b. If c can be formed, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.
