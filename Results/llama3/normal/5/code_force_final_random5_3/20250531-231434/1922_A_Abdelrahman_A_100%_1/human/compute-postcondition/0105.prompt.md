Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        counter = 0
        for x in c:
            if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                no = False
                print('YES')
                break
            counter += 1
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If c is equal to a or equal to b, 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b, then for each character x in c, if x is not present in the character at index counter of string a and also not present in the character at index counter of string b, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *tests is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 1, slength is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, c is a string equal to the third input string. If c is equal to a or b, then no is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, c must have at least slength characters, and for each character in c, it must be present in either a[counter] or b[counter] for any counter less than slength. If any character in c is not present in a[counter] or b[counter] for any counter less than slength, then no is False and 'YES' is printed if no is False, and we are out of the most internal loop or if statement if no is False. If no is True, then 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *tests is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 2, slength is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, c is a string equal to the third input string. If c is equal to a or b, then no was False and 'NO' was printed. Otherwise, c must have at least as many characters as the length of the string c, x is the last character in the string c, counter is equal to the length of the string c, no is False, 'YES' has been printed, and we are no longer inside the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
