Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string that must have at least 1 character. If the first character in string `c` is not in the character at index `counter` in either string `a` or string `b`, then `no` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
