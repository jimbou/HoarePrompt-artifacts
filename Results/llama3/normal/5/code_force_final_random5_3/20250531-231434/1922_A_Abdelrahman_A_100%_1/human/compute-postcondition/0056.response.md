Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string equal to the third input string that must have at least 2 characters, `x` is the second character of `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `counter` is increased by 1, `no` is set to False, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
