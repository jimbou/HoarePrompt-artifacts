Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `no` is False, `counter` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, `x` is the first character in the string `c`. The current value of `x` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and conditions. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement. The rest of the conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
