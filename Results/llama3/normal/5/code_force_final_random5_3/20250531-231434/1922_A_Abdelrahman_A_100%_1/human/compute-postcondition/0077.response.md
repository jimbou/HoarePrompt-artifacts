To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `c`. The loop will execute if `c` has at least one character.

State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `no` is True, `counter` is 0, `x` is the first character in string `c`**
