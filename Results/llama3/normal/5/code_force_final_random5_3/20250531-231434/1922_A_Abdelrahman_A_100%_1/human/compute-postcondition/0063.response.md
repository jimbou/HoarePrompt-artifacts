Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string equal to the third input string that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character of `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, `no` is False if it was False before, 'YES' is still printed if it was printed before, and we are still out of the most internal loop or if statement if we were out before. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' is printed.***
