Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string equal to the third input string, `no` is True, `counter` is 0, stdin contains t-6 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string equal to the third input string that must have at least 1 character, `x` is the first character of `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string equal to the third input string that must have at least 2 characters, `x` is the second character of `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, `no` is still False if it was False before, 'YES' is still printed if it was printed before, and we are still out of the most internal loop or if statement if we were out before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string equal to the third input string that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character of `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, `no` is False if it was False before, 'YES' is still printed if it was printed before, and we are still out of the most internal loop or if statement if we were out before. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
