Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tests is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 2, slength is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, c is a string equal to the third input string, no is True, counter is 0
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `counter` is increased by 1, If the first character in string `c` is not in the character at index `counter` in either string `a` or string `b`, then `no` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `x` is the second character in the string `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, `no` is still False if it was False before, otherwise it is still True, and we are still inside the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character in the string `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, `no` is False, 'YES' has been printed, and we are no longer inside the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
