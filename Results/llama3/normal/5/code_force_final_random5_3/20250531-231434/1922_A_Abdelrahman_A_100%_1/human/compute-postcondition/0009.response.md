To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `c`. The loop will execute if `c` has at least one character. Since `c` is a string, we can adjust its state to ensure it has at least one character.

State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `no` is True, `counter` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, `x` is the first character in the string `c`**
