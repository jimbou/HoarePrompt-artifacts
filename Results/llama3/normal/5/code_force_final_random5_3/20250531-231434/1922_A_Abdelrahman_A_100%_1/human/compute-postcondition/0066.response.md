Postcondition: **tests is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 1, slength is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, c is a string equal to the third input string. If c is equal to a or b, then no is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, c must have at least slength characters, and for each character in c, it must be present in either a[counter] or b[counter] for any counter less than slength. If any character in c is not present in a[counter] or b[counter] for any counter less than slength, then no is False and 'YES' is printed if no is False, and we are out of the most internal loop or if statement if no is False.**
