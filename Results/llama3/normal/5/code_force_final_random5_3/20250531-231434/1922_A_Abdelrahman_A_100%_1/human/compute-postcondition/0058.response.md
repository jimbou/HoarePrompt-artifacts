The only object in the loop head is variable `x` and string `c`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `c`.  If the string `c` has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `c` has at least 2 characters, `x` is the second character of `c`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `c` must have at least 3 characters and the `x` is the third character of `c`.
State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string equal to the third input string that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character of `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, `no` is still False if it was False before, 'YES' is still printed if it was printed before, and we are still out of the most internal loop or if statement if we were out before.**
