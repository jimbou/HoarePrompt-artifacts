Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string equal to the third input string that must have at least 1 character, `x` is the first character of `c`, if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.***
