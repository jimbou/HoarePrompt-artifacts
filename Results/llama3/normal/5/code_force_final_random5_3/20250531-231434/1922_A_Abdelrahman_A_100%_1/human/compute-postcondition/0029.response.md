Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `no` is False if the third character `x` of string `c` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, otherwise `no` is True, `counter` is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, `x` is the third character in the string `c`. If `x` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
