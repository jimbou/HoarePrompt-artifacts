Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program checks if string c can be formed by taking characters from strings a and b, where each character in c must be present in either the corresponding position in a or b. If c can be formed, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The program also handles the case where c is equal to a or b, in which case it prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
