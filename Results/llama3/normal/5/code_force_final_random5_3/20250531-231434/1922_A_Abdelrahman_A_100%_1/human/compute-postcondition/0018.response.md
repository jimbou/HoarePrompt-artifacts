Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `no` is False, `counter` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, `x` is the second character in the string `c`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `no` has been updated to False. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
