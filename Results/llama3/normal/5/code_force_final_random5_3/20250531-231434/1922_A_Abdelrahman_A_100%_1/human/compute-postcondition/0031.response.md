Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string that must have at least `len(c)` characters, `no` is False if any character `x` of string `c` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, otherwise `no` is True, `counter` is `len(c)`, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, `x` is the last character in the string `c`. If `x` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the string `c` has been fully traversed, and the variable `no` is set to False if any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding index of strings `a` and `b`, otherwise `no` remains True. The counter variable is now equal to the length of string `c`. If a character in `c` is not found in `a` and `b`, the loop breaks and 'YES' is printed.
