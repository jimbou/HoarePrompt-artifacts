According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tests`. If `tests` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and stdin contains t-1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed, `tests` must be at least 1 and `i` is 0.

State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
