Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `slength` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `c` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character in the string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `counter` is increased by 1, `no` is False, 'YES' has been printed, and we are no longer inside the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables.***
