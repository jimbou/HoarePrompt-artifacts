Postcondition: **tests is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), i is 0, slength is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, no is False, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If c is equal to a or equal to b, 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to a or b, then for each character x in c, if x is not present in the character at index counter of string a and also not present in the character at index counter of string b, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no is True.**
