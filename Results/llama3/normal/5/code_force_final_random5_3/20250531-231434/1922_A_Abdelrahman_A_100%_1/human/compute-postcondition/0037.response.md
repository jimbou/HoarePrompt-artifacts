The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and tests, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `tests`. If `i` is less than `tests`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `tests` must be greater than 1.
State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `slength` is an integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**
