Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly reads the input, checks if string c can be formed by taking characters from strings a and b, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. 

The program also handles the edge case where string c is equal to string a or string b, in which case it prints 'NO'. 

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. 

Correctness: **True**
