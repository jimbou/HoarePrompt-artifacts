The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the num is the third integer in the list.
State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i. `count_a` is a dictionary that contains at least three key-value pairs where the key is the first three integers in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1.**
