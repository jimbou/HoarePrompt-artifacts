To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `num` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, we can conclude that `n` is indeed at least 1.

The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), so we can set `num` to be the first value in this range, which is 1.

The other variables, `a`, `count_a`, and `max_score`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1, `max_score` is 0, `num` is 1**
