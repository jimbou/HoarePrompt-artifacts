Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i. `count_a` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a` remains a list of integers, and `n` remains a non-negative integer within the specified range. The dictionary `count_a` will contain key-value pairs for each unique integer in the list `a`, where the value represents the count of occurrences of that integer in the list.
