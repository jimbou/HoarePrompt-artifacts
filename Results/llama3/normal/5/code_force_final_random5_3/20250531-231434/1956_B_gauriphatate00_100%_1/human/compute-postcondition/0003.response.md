The value of `count_a[num]` is incremented by 1, where `num` is the first integer in the list `a`. The value of `num` is a key in `count_a`, so the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`), and the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1.**
