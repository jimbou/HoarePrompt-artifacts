Reasoning: The function correctly calculates the maximum number of points that can be scored by counting the number of integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice. This is because if an integer appears twice in the list, it means that the player has two cards with the same number, and they can score a point by playing one of these cards after the other player has played the same number. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`, and it returns the correct count of integers that appear exactly twice.

Correctness: **True**
