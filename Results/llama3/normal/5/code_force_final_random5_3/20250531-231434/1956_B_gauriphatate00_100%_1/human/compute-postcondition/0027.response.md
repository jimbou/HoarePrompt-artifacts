The only variable in the loop head is variable  num, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` and `n`. If `num` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the next integer in the range `range(1, n + 1)`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `num` must be increased by 1.
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1. `num` is the next integer in the range `range(1, n + 1)`. If the count of `num` in `count_a` is 2, `max_score` is increased by 1.**
