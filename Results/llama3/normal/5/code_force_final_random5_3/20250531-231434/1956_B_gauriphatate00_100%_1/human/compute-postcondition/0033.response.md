Functionality: **This function takes a list of integers `a` and a non-negative integer `n` as input, where each integer in `a` is in the range 1 to `n` (inclusive) and appears at most twice. It returns the count of integers in `a` that appear exactly twice. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`.**
