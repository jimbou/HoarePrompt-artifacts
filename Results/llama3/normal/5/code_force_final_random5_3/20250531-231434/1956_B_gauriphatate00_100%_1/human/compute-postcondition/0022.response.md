Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1. If the current value of `count_a[num]` is 2, then `max_score` is 1 and `num` is 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 0 and `num` remains unchanged. The current value of `num` is a key in `count_a`.***
