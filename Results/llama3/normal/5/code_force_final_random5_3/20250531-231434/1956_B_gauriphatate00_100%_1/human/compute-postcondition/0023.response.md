To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `num` and the range `range(1, n + 1)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is a key in `count_a`. For the loop to execute again, `num` must be incremented by 1, since the loop iterates over the range `range(1, n + 1)`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.

The state of `a` and `count_a` also remains unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop head.

The state of `max_score` and the current value of `num` in `count_a` are not relevant to the loop head, so they are not adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1. `num` is the next integer in the range `range(1, n + 1)`.**
