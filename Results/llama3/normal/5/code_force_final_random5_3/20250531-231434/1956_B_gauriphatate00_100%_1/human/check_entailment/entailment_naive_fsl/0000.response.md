Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the player's hand using a dictionary. Then, it iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to n and checks if the count of each number is 2. If it is, it increments the max_score by 1, because the player can score a point by playing the second occurrence of that number.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the player has no pairs of numbers, the max_score will be 0.
* When the player has one or more pairs of numbers, the max_score will be the number of pairs.
* When the player has no numbers that appear more than twice, the max_score will still be the number of pairs.

The program does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
