Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1. `num` is the next integer in the range `range(1, n + 1)`, and `max_score` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `max_score` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `a`, `n`, `count_a`, and `num` remain unchanged. The dictionary `count_a` still contains key-value pairs for each integer in the list `a`, and `num` is still the next integer in the range `range(1, n + 1)`.
