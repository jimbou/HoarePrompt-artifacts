Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i. `count_a` is a dictionary that contains at least three key-value pairs where the key is the first three integers in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). The value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged. The dictionary `count_a` is updated by incrementing the value of the key `num` (which is the first three integers in the list `a`) by 1. If `num` was already a key in `count_a`, its value is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1. The other key-value pairs in `count_a` remain unchanged.
