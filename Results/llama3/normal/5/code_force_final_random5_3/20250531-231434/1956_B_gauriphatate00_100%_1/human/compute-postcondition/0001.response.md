According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `count_a` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, `count_a` is an empty dictionary, num is the first integer in the list**
