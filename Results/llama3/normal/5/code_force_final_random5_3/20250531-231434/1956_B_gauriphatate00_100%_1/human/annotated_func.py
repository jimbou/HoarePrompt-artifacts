#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a at most 2 times.

If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1.

If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1. `num` is the last integer in the range `range(1, n + 1)`. If the count of `num` in `count_a` is 2, `max_score` is increased by 1.

    #The program returns the count of integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice in the list, where the integers in the list `a` are in the range 1 to `n` (inclusive), and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers `a` and a non-negative integer `n` as input, where each integer in `a` is in the range 1 to `n` (inclusive) and appears at most twice. It returns the count of integers in `a` that appear exactly twice. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`.
