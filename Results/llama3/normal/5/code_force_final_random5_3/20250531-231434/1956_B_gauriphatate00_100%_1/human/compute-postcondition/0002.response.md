Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`), and the current value of `num` is a key in `count_a`.**
