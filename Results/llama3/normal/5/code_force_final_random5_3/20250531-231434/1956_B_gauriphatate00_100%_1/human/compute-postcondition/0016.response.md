Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i. `count_a` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1. `max_score` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `max_score` that is initialized to 0. The values of `a`, `n`, and `count_a` remain unchanged.
