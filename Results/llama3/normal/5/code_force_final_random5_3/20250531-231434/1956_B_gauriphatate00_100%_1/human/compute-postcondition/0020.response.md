Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is each integer in the list `a` (denoted as `num`). If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with a value of 1, `max_score` is 1, `num` is 1. The current value of `num` is a key in `count_a` and the current value of `count_a[num]` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `max_score` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `max_score` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with `a` still being a list of integers, `n` being a non-negative integer within the specified range, and `count_a` being a dictionary with key-value pairs for each integer in `a`. The current value of `num` is still 1, and its corresponding value in `count_a` is still 2.
