Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Func_1 checks if the first n elements of a list are all 0. It returns True if all elements are 0, False otherwise.

Func_2 takes a list of integers and its length as input, modifies the list by performing a series of operations on its elements, and then checks if the modified list satisfies a certain condition using the func_1 function. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then calls func_2 to determine whether the array can be made zero using the given operation.

The operations performed in func_2 are also correct. It iterates over the array from the second element to the second last element, and for each element, it checks if it can be reduced to zero by applying the given operation. If it can, it modifies the array accordingly. If it cannot, it prints 'NO' and returns.

Finally, if the array can be made zero, func_2 calls func_1 to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
