Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation states that Rudolf can choose an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and assign:

* a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1
* a_i = a_i - 2
* a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1

However, the program does not correctly implement this operation. In the function func_2, the while loop is used to repeatedly subtract 1 from a_{i - 1}, 2 from a_i, and 1 from a_{i + 1} until a_i is less than or equal to 1. This is not the correct implementation of the operation.

Moreover, the program does not correctly check if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations. The function func_1 is used to check if all elements of the array are zero, but this is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

A correct solution would involve using a more sophisticated approach, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

For example, a correct solution could involve iterating over the array and checking if the current element is greater than or equal to the sum of the previous two elements. If it is, then it is possible to make the current element equal to zero by applying the operation. If it is not, then it is not possible to make the current element equal to zero.

Here is an example of a correct solution:

```
def can_make_zero(arr):
    for i in range(2, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < arr[i-1] + arr[i-2]:
            return False
    return True
```

This solution correctly checks if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.
