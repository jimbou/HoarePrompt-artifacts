To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 2.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is still greater than 2, the loop can execute again.

The state of the list and its elements does not need to be adjusted, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is two times less than its original value, the third element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is 2, and the element at index i-1 in the list is not specified**
