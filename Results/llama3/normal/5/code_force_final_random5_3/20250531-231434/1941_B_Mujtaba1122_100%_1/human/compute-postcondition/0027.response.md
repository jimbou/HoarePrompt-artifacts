Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is two times less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is three times less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is two times less than its original value minus the original value of the first element minus two times the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater or equal to 2 and is two times less than its original value minus the original value of the second element minus the original value of the first element (with the additional constraint that its original value minus the original value of the second element is at least 4), the element at index i+1 is greater or equal to 1 and is two times less than its original value minus the original value of the first element minus the original value of the first element minus the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i is greater than 0 and is two times less than its original value minus the original value of the first element minus the original value of the first element minus two times the value of the element at index i-1, the element at index i-1 is greater than 0 and is equal to zero, the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is 3**

Explanation:
The code modifies the list and its elements based on their original values and the values of other elements. The first element remains unchanged. The second element remains unchanged. The third element is modified by subtracting two times the value of the second element. The fourth element is modified by subtracting the value of the third element. The element at index i+1 is modified by subtracting the value of the element at index i-1. The element at index i is modified by subtracting two times the value of the element at index i-1. The element at index i-1 is set to zero. The rest of the elements remain unchanged. The value of n and i remains unchanged.
