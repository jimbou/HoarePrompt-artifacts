Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if the first `n` elements of a list are all zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, and `False` otherwise.

`func_2` takes a list of integers and its length as input, modifies the list by performing a series of operations on its elements, and then checks if the modified list satisfies a certain condition using the `func_1` function. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
3. Call `func_2` with the array and its length as arguments.
4. `func_2` modifies the array by performing the specified operations and then checks if the modified array satisfies the condition using `func_1`.
5. If the condition is met, print 'YES', otherwise print 'NO'.

The program's correctness can be evaluated by analyzing the logic and the functions' behavior.

* `func_1` is correct because it simply checks if the first `n` elements of a list are all zero.
* `func_2` is correct because it modifies the array according to the specified operations and then checks if the modified array satisfies the condition using `func_1`. The operations performed by `func_2` are designed to make all elements of the array equal to zero, and the condition checked by `func_1` ensures that this is indeed the case.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
