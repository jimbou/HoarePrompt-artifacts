You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list.
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is two times less than its original value, the third element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is n-1, and the element at index i-1 in the list is 0.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list remains unchanged with the first element being one less than its original value, the second element being two times less than its original value, the third element being one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element being one less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remaining unchanged. The integer n is equal to the length of the list and is greater than 2. The element at index i-1 in the list is 0. If the function func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is two times less than its original value, the third element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is n-1, and the element at index i-1 in the list is 0.

Case_2: list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is two times less than its original value, the third element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2. i is n-1. The element at index i-1 in the list is 0. Additionally, the function func_1(list, n) returns True, indicating that the list and n satisfy the condition specified by func_1, and 'YES' is printed

Case_3: list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is two times less than its original value, the third element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is n-1, and the element at index i-1 in the list is 0. Additionally, the function func_1(list, n) returns False, and 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
