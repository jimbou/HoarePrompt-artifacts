Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the previous element, 2 from the current element, and 1 from the next element.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, and `func_2` attempts to make all elements zero using the specified operation.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1.  In `func_2`, the while loop condition is incorrect. It checks if `list[i] > 1` and `list[i - 1] > 0` and `(list[i + 1] > 0)`, but it should check if `list[i] >= 2` and `list[i - 1] >= 1` and `(list[i + 1] >= 1)`. This is because the operation requires subtracting 2 from the current element, 1 from the previous element, and 1 from the next element.

2.  Inside the while loop, the updates to `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` are incorrect. The correct updates should be `list[i + 1] -= 1`, `list[i] -= 2`, and `list[i - 1] -= 1`.

3.  The program does not handle the case where the first or last element is non-zero. The operation cannot be applied to these elements, so the program should check if they are zero separately.

4.  The program prints 'no' or 'YES'/'NO' directly, but it should return a boolean value or a string instead, to make it more flexible and reusable.

5.  The program does not handle invalid inputs. For example, it does not check if the input list is empty or if the elements are not integers.

6.  The program does not follow the problem's output format. The problem requires outputting "YES" or "NO" in uppercase, but the program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' in lowercase.

7.  The program does not handle the case where the input list has less than 3 elements. The problem statement guarantees that the list will have at least 3 elements, but the program should still check for this to make it more robust.

Correctness: **False**
