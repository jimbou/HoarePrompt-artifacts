Postcondition: ***list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is two times less than its original value, the third element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is 1, and the element at index i-1 in the list is 0***
