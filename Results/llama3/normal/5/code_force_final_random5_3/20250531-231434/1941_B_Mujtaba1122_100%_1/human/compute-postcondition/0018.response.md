To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` according to the conditions in the loop head.

1. `list[i] > 1`: At the end of the previous iteration, `list[i]` (which is the third element) is four less than the difference between its original value and the original value of the first element, and this difference is at least 2. To ensure `list[i]` is greater than 1, the difference between its original value and the original value of the first element must be at least 6 (so that after subtracting 4, it's still greater than 1).

2. `list[i - 1] > 0`: At the end of the previous iteration, `list[i - 1]` (which is the second element) is greater than 1 and is five times less than its original value. To ensure it remains greater than 0, its original value must be at least 6 (so that after dividing by 5, it's still greater than 1).

3. `list[i + 1] > 0`: At the end of the previous iteration, `list[i + 1]` (which is the fourth element) is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value minus the original value of the first element. To ensure it remains greater than 0, its original value minus the original value of the first element must be at least 3 (so that after subtracting 2, it's still greater than 0).

The states of `n` and `i` do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly involved in the loop condition.

State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is four less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is five times less than its original value and its original value is at least 6, the third element's original value minus the original value of the first element is at least 6 and is four less than this difference, the fourth element's original value minus the original value of the second element is at least 1 and is four less than this difference and its original value minus the original value of the first element is at least 3, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged except for the element at index i+1 which is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is 2**
