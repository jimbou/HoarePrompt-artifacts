Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 checks if all elements in the list are zero, and returns True if they are, and False otherwise. func_2 applies the operation to the list, and then calls func_1 to check if all elements are zero.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases (t) and the number of elements in the array (n) for each test case.
2. It reads the array elements for each test case.
3. It calls func_2, which applies the operation to the array and then calls func_1 to check if all elements are zero.
4. If func_1 returns True, it prints "YES", indicating that Rudolf can make all elements equal to zero. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
