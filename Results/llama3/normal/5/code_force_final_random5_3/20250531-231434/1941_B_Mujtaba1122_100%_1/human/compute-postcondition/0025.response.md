Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is two times less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is three times less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, the third element is greater than 0 and is two times less than its original value minus the original value of the first element minus two times the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater or equal to 2 and is two times less than its original value minus the original value of the second element minus the original value of the first element (with the additional constraint that its original value minus the original value of the second element is at least 4), the element at index i+1 is greater or equal to 1 and is two times less than its original value minus the original value of the first element minus the original value of the first element, the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is 3**
