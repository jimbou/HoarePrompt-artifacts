The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, list is a list of integers and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2 and i is now 1. 
State: **`list` is a list of integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1**
