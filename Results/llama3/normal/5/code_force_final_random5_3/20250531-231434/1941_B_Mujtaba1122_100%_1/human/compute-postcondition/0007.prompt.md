Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `list` is a list of integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1
Code of the loop:
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
    list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
    list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is two times less than its original value, the third element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is two times less than its original value, the third element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 1 and is three less than its original value, the second element is greater than 2 and is three times less than its original value, the third element is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the first element minus the original value of the first element minus the original value of the first element, the fourth element is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value minus the original value of the second element minus the original value of the first element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is 2


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
