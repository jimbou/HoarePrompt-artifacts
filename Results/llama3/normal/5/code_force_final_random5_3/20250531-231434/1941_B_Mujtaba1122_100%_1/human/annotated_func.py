#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if the first n elements of a list are all 0. Returns True if all elements are 0, False otherwise.

The integer n is equal to the length of the list and is greater than 2. The element at index i-1 in the list is 0. If the function func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers and its length as input, modifies the list by performing a series of operations on its elements, and then checks if the modified list satisfies a certain condition using the func_1 function. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
