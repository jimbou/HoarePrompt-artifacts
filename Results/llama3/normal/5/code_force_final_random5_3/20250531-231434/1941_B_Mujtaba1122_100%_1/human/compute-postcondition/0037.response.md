Functionality: This function modifies a list of integers and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the modified list and its length. It takes a list and an integer n as input, where n is the length of the list and is between 3 and 2 * 10^5. The function modifies the list by subtracting values from certain elements, and then checks a condition using the function func_1. If the condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, but its output is the modified list and the printed result.
