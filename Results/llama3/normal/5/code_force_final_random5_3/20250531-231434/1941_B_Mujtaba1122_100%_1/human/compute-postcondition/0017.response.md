Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is greater than 0 and is four less than its original value, the second element is greater than 1 and is five times less than its original value, the third element's original value minus the original value of the first element must be at least 2 and is four less than this difference, the fourth element's original value minus the original value of the second element must be at least 1 and is four less than this difference, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged except for the element at index i+1 which is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value minus the original value of the first element, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than 2, i is 2**
