Based on the precondition, here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `t` is a non-negative integer, which means it can be any integer value greater than or equal to 0.
2. `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions. However, the specific values of `player` are not provided.
3. `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger. Again, the specific values of `blud` are not provided.
4. `out` is a list containing at least 3 players, and `p` is the third player in the sorted list `out`. This means that `p` is a string representing the third player in the sorted list of players.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')`

The print statement will output the following values:

* `t`: a non-negative integer value
* `p`: the third player in the sorted list `out`, represented as a string
* `'ELIMINATED'`: a literal string

Since we don't have explicit values for `t` and `p`, we can't provide a numerical or exact string output. However, we can describe the output using the given information.

Output: **[a non-negative integer value], [the third player in the sorted list out], ELIMINATED**
