Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `t`: a non-negative integer
* `player`: a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions
* `blud`: a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger
* `out`: a list containing at least one player whose position was equal to the position of the Bludger
* `p`: the first player in the sorted list `out`

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')`

The print statement will output the following values:

* `t`: the current value of the non-negative integer `t`
* `p`: the first player in the sorted list `out`, which is a string representing a player
* `'ELIMINATED'`: a literal string indicating that the player has been eliminated

Output: **[t] [p] ELIMINATED (where t is the current value of the non-negative integer t and p is the first player in the sorted list out)**
