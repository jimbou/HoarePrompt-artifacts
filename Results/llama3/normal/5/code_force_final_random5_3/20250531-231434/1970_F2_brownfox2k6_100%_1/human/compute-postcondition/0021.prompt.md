Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions, blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger, out is a list containing all players whose positions were equal to the position of the Bludger.
Code of the loop:
for p in sorted(out):
    print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger, `out` is a list containing at least one player whose position was equal to the position of the Bludger, `p` is the first player in the sorted list `out`, and the current time `t`, the first player `p` in the sorted list `out` and the string 'ELIMINATED' are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger, `out` is a list containing at least 2 players, `p` is the second player in the sorted list `out`, and this is printed: the current time t, the second player p in the sorted list out, and the string 'ELIMINATED'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger, `out` is a list containing at least 3 players, `p` is the third player in the sorted list `out`, and this is printed: the current time `t`, the third player in the sorted list `out` which is `p`, and the string 'ELIMINATED'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
