Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger, `out` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p in player:
    if player[p] == blud:
        out.append(p)
        player[p] = [-1, -1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions that must have at least 1 player, blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger. If the position of the first player in the dictionary is the same as the position of the Bludger, then the first player is added to the out list and their position in the player dictionary is set to [-1, -1]. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions that must have at least 2 players, blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger. If player p is at the same position as the Bludger, then player p is added to the out list and player p's position is updated to [-1, -1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions that must have at least 2 players, blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger. If player[p] is equal to blud, then out is a list containing the player p and player[p] is a list containing -1 and -1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
