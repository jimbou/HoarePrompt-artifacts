Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to simulate a game of Quidditch, where two teams, Gryffindor (R) and Ravenclaw (B), compete to score points by moving the Quaffle (Q) into the opponent's goal. The game also features a Bludger (B) that can eliminate players.

The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` moves an object (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) on the field in a specified direction. `func_2` checks if any players are at the same position as the Bludger and eliminates them if so.

The program correctly implements the game logic, including:

1. Moving players, Quaffle, and Bludger on the field based on the input actions.
2. Checking for collisions between players and the Bludger, and eliminating players if necessary.
3. Updating the score when a player scores a goal.
4. Printing the final score at the end of the game.

However, there are a few minor issues:

1. The program does not check if the Quaffle is being carried by a player when it is thrown. According to the problem statement, the Quaffle should only be thrown if it is being carried by a player.
2. The program does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. According to the problem statement, the Quaffle should remain on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger after the move.

Despite these minor issues, the program correctly implements the main game logic and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
