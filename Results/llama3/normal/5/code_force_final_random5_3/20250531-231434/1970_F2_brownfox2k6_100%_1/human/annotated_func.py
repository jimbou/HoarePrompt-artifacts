#Overall this is what the function does:Moves an object on a field in a specified direction. The function takes a list of two integers representing the object's coordinates and a string representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). It then updates the object's coordinates based on the direction: moving up decreases the x-coordinate by 1, moving down increases the x-coordinate by 1, moving left decreases the y-coordinate by 1, and moving right increases the y-coordinate by 1. The function returns the updated coordinates.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions, blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger.

    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: t is a non-negative integer, player is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions, blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger, out is a list containing all players whose positions were equal to the position of the Bludger.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing players and values are lists of two integers representing positions, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger, `out` is an empty list, and all players in the initial `out` list have been printed along with the current time `t` and the string 'ELIMINATED' in sorted order.

#Overall this is what the function does:Identifies and eliminates players whose positions match the Bludger's position, printing the eliminated players in sorted order along with the current time, and updates the player positions to [-1, -1].
