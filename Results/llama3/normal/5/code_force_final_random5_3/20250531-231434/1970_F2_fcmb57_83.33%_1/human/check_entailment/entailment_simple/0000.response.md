Reasoning: 
The provided Python program is designed to simulate a game of Quidditch, as described in the problem statement. The program correctly initializes the game state, processes the moves, and updates the score. However, there are a few issues with the program.

Firstly, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code. It is supposed to take a position and a movement as input and return the new position. However, the state of the program right before the function call suggests that it is supposed to return the sum of the first integer in list `a` and the first string in list `b`, and the sum of the second integer in list `a` and the second string in list `b`. This is not a valid operation, as you cannot add an integer and a string.

Secondly, the program does not correctly handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. In this case, the Quaffle should remain on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger after the move. However, the program does not update the position of the Quaffle in this case.

Lastly, the program does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal. In this case, the other team should win a point, but the program does not update the score correctly.

Correctness: **False**
