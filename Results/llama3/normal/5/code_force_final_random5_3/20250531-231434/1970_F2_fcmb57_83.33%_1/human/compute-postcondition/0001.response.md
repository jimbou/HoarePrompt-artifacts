Output State: **The program returns two values: the sum of the first integer in list 'a' and the first string in list 'b', and the sum of the second integer in list 'a' and the second string in list 'b'.**

In other words, the program returns two values: `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `x` is the first integer in list `a`, `dx` is the first string in list `b`, `y` is the second integer in list `a`, and `dy` is the second string in list `b`.
