Functionality: This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input. It then returns two values: the sum of the first element of 'a' (an integer) and the first element of 'b' (a string), and the sum of the second element of 'a' (an integer) and the second element of 'b' (a string). The function does not modify the input lists.
