To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is at least 1.

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n`, _ is 0**
