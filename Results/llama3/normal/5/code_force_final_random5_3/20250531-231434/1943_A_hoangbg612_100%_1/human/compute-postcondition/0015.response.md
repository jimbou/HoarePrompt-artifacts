Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list N, cur is equal to num, M[cur] is 1, stdin contains T - 2 test cases if num is greater than cur + 1, otherwise stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`, which is the second element in the sorted list `N`. The value of `M[cur]` has been set to 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it has been reduced by another 1. The values of `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged.
