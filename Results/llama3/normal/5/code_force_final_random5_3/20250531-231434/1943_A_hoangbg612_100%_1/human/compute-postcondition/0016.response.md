Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, stdin contains `T - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `T - 1` test cases.
