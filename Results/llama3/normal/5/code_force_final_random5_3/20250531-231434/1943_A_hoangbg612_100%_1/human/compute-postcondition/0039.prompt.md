Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is an empty list, cur is the last element in the original list N plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise cur remains the last element in the original list N, M is a dictionary where the keys are the elements in the original list N and the values are the number of times each element appears in the list N, cnt is an empty list, stdin contains T - 1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `cur` is the last element in the original list `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element in the original list `N`, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is a list containing the first key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, otherwise `cnt` remains an empty list, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `cur` is the last element in the original list `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element in the original list `N`, `M` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `cnt` is a list containing the first key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, and the second key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, otherwise `cnt` remains an empty list, `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `cur` is the last element in the original list `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element in the original list `N`, `M` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, `cnt` is a list containing the first key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, the second key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, and the third key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, otherwise `cnt` remains an empty list, `k` is the third key in the dictionary `M`, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
