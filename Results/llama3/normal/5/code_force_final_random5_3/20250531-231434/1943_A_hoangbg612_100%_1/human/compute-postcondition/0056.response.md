The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, N has at least 1 element, num is the first element of N. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the num is the second element in the list.
State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element of N and the value is 1 if the first element of N is greater than cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with cur as a key and its value is increased by 1, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, and cur is either the first element of N if the first element of N is greater than cur, otherwise cur is -1, num is the second element in the list.**
