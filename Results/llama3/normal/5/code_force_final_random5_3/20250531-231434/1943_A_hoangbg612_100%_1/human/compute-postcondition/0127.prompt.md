Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is an empty list, num is not defined, cnt is an empty list, if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals the input value S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is an empty list, num is not defined, M is a dictionary that must have at least 1 key, k is the first key in the dictionary M. If the value of M[k] is 1, then cnt is a list containing the first key k of dictionary M. Otherwise, cnt remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is an empty list, `num` is not defined, `M` is a dictionary that must have at least 2 keys, `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`. If the value of `M[k]` is 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the second key `k` of dictionary `M`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is an empty list, `num` is not defined, `M` is a dictionary that must have at least 3 keys, `k` is the third key in the dictionary `M`. If the value of `M[k]` is 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the third key `k` of dictionary `M`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
