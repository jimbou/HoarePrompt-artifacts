Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list N, cur is the third element in the list N plus one, M[cur] is 1 if num is greater than cur, otherwise M[cur] is incremented by 1, stdin contains T - 2 test cases if num is greater than cur + 1, otherwise stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**

In this final state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. The value of `M[cur]` depends on whether `num` is greater than `cur` or not. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` also depends on the comparison between `num` and `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `stdin` contains `T - 2` test cases. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases. All other variables remain unchanged.
