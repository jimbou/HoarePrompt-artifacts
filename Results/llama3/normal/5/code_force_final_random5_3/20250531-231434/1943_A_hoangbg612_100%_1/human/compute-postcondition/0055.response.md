Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element of N and the value is 1 if the first element of N is greater than cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with cur as a key and its value is increased by 1, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, and cur is either the first element of N if the first element of N is greater than cur, otherwise cur is -1.***
