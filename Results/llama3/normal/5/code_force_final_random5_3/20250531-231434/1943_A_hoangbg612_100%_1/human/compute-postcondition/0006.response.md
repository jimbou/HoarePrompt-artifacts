Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, cur is 0, M is an empty dictionary, num is the first element in the list N, stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `cur` by 1, making it 0. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
