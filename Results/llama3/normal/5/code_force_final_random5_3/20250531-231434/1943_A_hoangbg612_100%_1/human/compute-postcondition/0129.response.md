Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is an empty list, num is not defined, M is a dictionary that must have at least as many keys as the number of iterations of the loop, k is the last key in the dictionary M, cnt is a list containing at least two elements, where the last key k of dictionary M has a value of 1, and cur is equal to the second element of cnt.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is still an integer equal to the input value, N is still an empty list, num is still not defined, M is still a dictionary that must have at least as many keys as the number of iterations of the loop, k is still the last key in the dictionary M, cnt is still a list containing at least two elements, where the last key k of dictionary M has a value of 1, and a new variable cur is introduced which is equal to the second element of cnt.
