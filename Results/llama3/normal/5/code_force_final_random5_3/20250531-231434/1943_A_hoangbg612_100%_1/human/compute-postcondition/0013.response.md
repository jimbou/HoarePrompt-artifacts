Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list N, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, cur is incremented by 1**

The code block increments the value of `cur` by 1 and then breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is part of. The `break` statement does not affect any variables, but it does change the flow of the program. The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, so its new value is one more than its original value. The other variables, `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num`, are not affected by the code block. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, since one test case has been processed.
