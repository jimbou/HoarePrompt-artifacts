To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `k` and `M`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `M`. If `M` has at least 1 key, the loop can execute.

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is an empty list, `num` is not defined, `cnt` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary that must have at least 1 key, `k` is the first key in the dictionary `M`**
