To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `N` has at least one more integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `N` has at least 1 integer, and `num` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, cur is either the value of the first integer in the list or -1, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either the first integer in the list or -1 and the value is 1, k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.**
