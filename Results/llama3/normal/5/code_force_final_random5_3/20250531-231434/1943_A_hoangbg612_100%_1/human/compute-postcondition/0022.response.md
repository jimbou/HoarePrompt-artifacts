Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list N, M[cur] is incremented by 1, and stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1, indicating that the current value cur has been encountered one more time. The other variables remain unchanged, with T still being an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S being an integer, N being a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, and num being the third element in the list N. Additionally, the number of test cases in stdin has been reduced to T - 1.
