Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers, M is an empty dictionary, k is not defined, _ is 1, cur is -1, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, then cur is updated to the value of num, and M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 1, and num is less than or equal to cur. In both cases, k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, then cur is updated to num and M is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is either the first integer in the list or -1 and the value is 1, and another key-value pair where the key is equal to num and the value is 1. Otherwise, cur remains either the value of the first integer in the list or -1, and M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either the first integer in the list or -1 and the value is 2. In both cases, k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, if num is larger than cur, cur is updated to the third integer in the list and M is a dictionary with either two or three key-value pairs where the key is the third integer in the list and the value is 1. Otherwise, cur is either the value of the first integer in the list or -1 and M is a dictionary with either two or three key-value pairs where the value of the key cur is increased by 1. k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
