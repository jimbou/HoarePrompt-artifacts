Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.
3. It sorts the array `N` in ascending order.
4. It initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will keep track of the current MEX value.
5. It creates a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each element in the array `N`.
6. It iterates over the sorted array `N` and updates the `cur` variable and the `M` dictionary as follows:
	* If the current element is greater than `cur`, it checks if the difference between the current element and `cur` is greater than 1. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it updates `cur` to the current element and sets its frequency in `M` to 1.
	* If the current element is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in `M`.
7. After iterating over the entire array, it checks if the sum of the frequencies in `M` is equal to the size of the array `S`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.
8. It creates a list `cnt` to store the elements in `M` with a frequency of 1.
9. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it updates `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.
10. Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which represents the final score of the game.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues with the code:

* The variable names `S`, `N`, `M`, and `cnt` are not very descriptive. It would be better to use more descriptive names to improve the code's readability.
* The code uses a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each element, but it only uses the keys of the dictionary. It would be more efficient to use a list or a set to store the unique elements.
* The code uses a list `cnt` to store the elements with a frequency of 1, but it only uses the second element of the list. It would be more efficient to use a single variable to store the second element.

Despite these minor issues, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
