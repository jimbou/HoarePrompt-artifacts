Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a list with at least one element, M is a dictionary with at least len(M) key-value pairs, k is the last key in the dictionary M, stdin contains T - 1 test cases. If there are at least two keys k in the dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, then cur is the second element in the list cnt. Otherwise, cur remains the last element in the original list N plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise cur remains the last element in the original list N.***
