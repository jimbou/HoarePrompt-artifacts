Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in the list `N`, stdin contains `T - 1` test cases. The current value of `num` is greater than the current value of `cur` and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`***
