The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Since `cur` is -1, this means that the value of `M[-1]` is incremented by 1.

However, since `M` is an empty dictionary, it does not have a key `-1`. Therefore, this code will raise a `KeyError` because it is trying to increment a value that does not exist.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in the list `N`, stdin contains `T - 1` test cases, and a `KeyError` is raised because `M` does not have a key `-1`.**
