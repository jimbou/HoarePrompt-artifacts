Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary, stdin contains T - 1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list `N`, stdin contains `T - 1` test cases. If `num` is greater than the initial value of `cur` (-1), then `cur` is updated to the first element in the list `N`, and `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in the list `N` and the value is 1. Otherwise, a `KeyError` is raised because `M` does not have a key `-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num, M[cur] is 1, and stdin contains T - 2 test cases if num is greater than cur + 1, otherwise stdin contains T - 1 test cases. Otherwise, M[cur] is incremented by 1, and stdin contains T - 1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num, M[cur] is 1, and stdin contains T - 1 test cases. Otherwise, M[cur] is incremented by 1, and stdin contains T - 1 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
