Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element of N and the value is 2 if the first element of N is greater than -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with -1 as a key and its value is increased by 1, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, and cur is either the first element of N if the first element of N is greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1, num is the second element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of T remains the same, an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive). The value of S is still equal to the input value. The list N remains a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements. The dictionary M has been updated, and its key-value pair has been incremented by 1. The key of M is either the first element of N (if it's greater than -1) or -1. The value of k is still undefined. The stdin still contains T - 3 test cases. The value of cur is either the first element of N (if it's greater than -1) or -1. The value of num is still the second element in the list.
