Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is an empty list, `num` is not defined, `M` is a dictionary that must have at least 2 keys, `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`. If the value of `M[k]` is 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the second key `k` of dictionary `M`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list.**
