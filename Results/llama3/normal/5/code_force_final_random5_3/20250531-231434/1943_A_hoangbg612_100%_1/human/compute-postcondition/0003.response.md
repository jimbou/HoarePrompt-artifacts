To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `num` and the list `N`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `N` is a sorted list of integers, we can assume that the first element in the list is the smallest integer.

To make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `N` to have at least 1 element, and the state of `num` to be the first element in the list.

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in the list `N`, stdin contains `T - 1` test cases**
