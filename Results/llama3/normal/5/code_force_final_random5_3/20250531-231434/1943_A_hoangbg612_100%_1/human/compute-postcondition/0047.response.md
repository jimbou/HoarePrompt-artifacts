According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is an empty dictionary, `k` is undefined, `cur` is -1, stdin contains T - 3 test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the num is the first element in the list.
State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `k` is undefined, `cur` is -1, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, num is the first element in the list**
