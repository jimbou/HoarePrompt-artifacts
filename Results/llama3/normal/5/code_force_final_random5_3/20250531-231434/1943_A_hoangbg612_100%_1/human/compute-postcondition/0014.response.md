Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list N, stdin contains T - 1 test cases. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is incremented by 1 and stdin contains T - 2 test cases. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
