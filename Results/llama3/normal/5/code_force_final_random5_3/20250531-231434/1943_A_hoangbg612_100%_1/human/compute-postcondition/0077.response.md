To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `k` and `M`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary `M`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more key in `M` that has not been processed yet.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is the first key in `M`, and `M` has at least one key-value pair. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be the next key in `M`, and `M` must have at least two key-value pairs.

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the second key in `M`, `cnt` is a list with one element which is the second key in `M` if the value of `M[k]` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is an empty list, stdin contains `T - 3` test cases. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0.**
