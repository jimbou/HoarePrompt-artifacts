Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the first key in `M`, `cnt` is a list with one element which is the first key in `M` if the value of `M[k]` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is an empty list, stdin contains `T - 3` test cases. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0.***
