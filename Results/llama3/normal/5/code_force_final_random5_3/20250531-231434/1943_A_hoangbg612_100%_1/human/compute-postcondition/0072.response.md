Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the elements of the original list N and the values are the counts of each element, k is undefined, cnt is an empty list, stdin contains T - 3 test cases. If the sum of the values in dictionary M is equal to S, then cur is the last element of the original list N plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new empty list `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the sum of the values in dictionary M and the value of `cur` are still applicable.
