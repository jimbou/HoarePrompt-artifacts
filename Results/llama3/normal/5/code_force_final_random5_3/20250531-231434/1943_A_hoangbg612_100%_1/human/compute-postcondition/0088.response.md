Output: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the last key in `M`. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0. If the length of `cnt` is 2 or more, `cnt` is a list with two or more elements where each element is a key in `M` with a value of 1, and `cur` is the second element of `cnt`. Otherwise, no changes are made. stdin contains `T - 3` test cases, and the value of `cur` is being printed**
