Output State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value is increased by 1, `k` is undefined, `cur` is -1, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, num is the first element in the list, and num is less than or equal to cur**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been increased by 1, where `cur` is -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `M` now has a key-value pair where the key is -1 and the value is increased by 1. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
