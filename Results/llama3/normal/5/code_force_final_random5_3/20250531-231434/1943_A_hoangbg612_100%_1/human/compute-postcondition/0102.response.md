Postcondition: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, if num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is incremented by 1, otherwise cur remains unchanged, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either the first integer in the list or -1 and the value is 1, k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.**
