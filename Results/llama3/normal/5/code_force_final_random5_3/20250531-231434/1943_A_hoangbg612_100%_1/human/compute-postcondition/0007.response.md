Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, if num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to cur. M is an empty dictionary, num is the first element in the list N, stdin contains T - 1 test cases.***
