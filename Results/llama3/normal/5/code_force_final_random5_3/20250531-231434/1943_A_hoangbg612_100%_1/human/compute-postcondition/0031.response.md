Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `cur` is the last element in the original list `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element in the original list `N`, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is a list containing the first key `k` in the dictionary `M`, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases, and the value of `M[k]` is 1.**

In this output state, the code has appended the first key `k` in the dictionary `M` to the list `cnt`, which was initially empty. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
