Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, then cur is updated to the value of num, and M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with key cur = -1 and value 1, and num is less than or equal to cur. In both cases, k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.***
