Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, cur is either the value of the first integer in the list or -1, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either the first integer in the list or -1 and the value is 2, k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
