Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `cur` is the last element in the original list `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element in the original list `N`, `M` is a dictionary with at least `len(M)` key-value pairs, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, otherwise `cnt` remains an empty list, `k` is the last key in the dictionary `M`, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same characteristics as the initial state, with the following changes:

*   The dictionary `M` will have at least as many key-value pairs as there are unique elements in the list `N`.
*   The list `cnt` will contain all keys `k` from the dictionary `M` where the value `M[k]` equals 1, indicating that these keys appear only once in the list `N`.
*   The variable `k` will be the last key processed in the dictionary `M`.

All other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, and `stdin`) will remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
