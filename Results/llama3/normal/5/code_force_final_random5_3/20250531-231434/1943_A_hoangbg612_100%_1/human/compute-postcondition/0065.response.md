Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with the third element of N as a key and its value is 1, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 4 test cases, and cur is the third element of N.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, which is the third element of the list `N`. Then, it updates the dictionary `M` by setting the value of the key `cur` to 1. Since `cur` is now the third element of `N`, the dictionary `M` will have this element as a key with a value of 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
