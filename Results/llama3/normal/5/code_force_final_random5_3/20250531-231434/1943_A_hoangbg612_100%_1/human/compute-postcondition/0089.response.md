The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not defined, `T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive).
State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the last key in `M`, `_` is 1**
