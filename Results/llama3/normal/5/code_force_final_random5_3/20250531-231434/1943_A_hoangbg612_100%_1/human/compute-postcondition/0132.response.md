Output: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is an empty list, num is not defined, M is a dictionary that must have at least as many keys as the number of iterations of the loop, k is the last key in the dictionary M. If the value of M[k] is 1 and cnt has at least two elements, then cnt is a list containing at least two elements, where the last key k of dictionary M has a value of 1, and cur is equal to the second element of cnt. Otherwise, cnt remains an empty list, and the value of cur is being printed, where cur is equal to the second element of cnt if cnt has at least two elements and the value of M[k] is 1, otherwise cur is undefined.**
