Output State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the third element of `N` and the value is increased by 1 if the third element of `N` is greater than the current value, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with the second element of `N` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the second element of `N` is greater than -1, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with -1 as a key and its value is increased by 1, `k` is undefined, `stdin` contains `T - 4` test cases, `cur` is the third element of `N` if the third element of `N` is greater than the current value, otherwise `cur` is either the second element of `N` if the second element of `N` is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is -1, `num` is the third element in the list**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` remains the same, `S` is still equal to the input value, `N` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either the third element of `N`, the second element of `N`, or -1, and the value is increased by 1, `k` is still undefined, `stdin` still contains `T - 4` test cases, `cur` is still either the third element of `N`, the second element of `N`, or -1, and `num` is still the third element in the list.
