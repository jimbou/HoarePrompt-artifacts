Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, cur is the first element in the list N, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in the list N and the value is 1, num is the first element in the list N, stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num` (the first element in the list `N`) to `cur`. Then, it adds a key-value pair to the dictionary `M`, where the key is the value of `cur` (which is the same as `num`) and the value is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
