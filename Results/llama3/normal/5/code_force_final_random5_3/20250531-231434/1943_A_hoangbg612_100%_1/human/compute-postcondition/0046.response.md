Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers, M is an empty dictionary, k is undefined, cur is -1, stdin contains T - 3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of S has been updated to the input value. The list N has been sorted in ascending order. The dictionary M has been reset to an empty dictionary, so k is no longer defined. The variable cur has been initialized to -1. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 2 due to the two input operations.
