The code reads the first line of the input, which contains a single integer `t`, and assigns it to the variable `T`. The value of `t` is between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive). The remaining input contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`.**
