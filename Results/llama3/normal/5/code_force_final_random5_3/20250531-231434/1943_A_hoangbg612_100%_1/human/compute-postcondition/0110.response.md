Output State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `cur` is either the value of the first integer in the list or -1, `M` is a dictionary with either two or three key-value pairs where the value of the key `cur` is increased by 1, `k` is not defined, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1, but the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `M` still has either two or three key-value pairs, but the value associated with the key `cur` has been increased by 1. The rest of the variables retain their initial values and properties.
