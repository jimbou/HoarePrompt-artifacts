The only object in the loop head is variable  num and list N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, N has at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list N. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the num is the third element in the list.
State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num, M[cur] is 1, and stdin contains T - 2 test cases if num is greater than cur + 1, otherwise stdin contains T - 1 test cases. Otherwise, M[cur] is incremented by 1, and stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**
