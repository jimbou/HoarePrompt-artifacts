Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is an empty dictionary, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 3 test cases. If the first element in the list, `num`, is greater than the current value of `cur` plus 1, then `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.***
