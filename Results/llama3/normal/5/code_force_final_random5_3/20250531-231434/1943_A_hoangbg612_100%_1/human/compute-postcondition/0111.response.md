Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, if num is larger than cur, cur is updated to the third integer in the list and M is a dictionary with either two or three key-value pairs where the key is the third integer in the list and the value is 1. Otherwise, cur is either the value of the first integer in the list or -1 and M is a dictionary with either two or three key-value pairs where the value of the key cur is increased by 1. k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.***
