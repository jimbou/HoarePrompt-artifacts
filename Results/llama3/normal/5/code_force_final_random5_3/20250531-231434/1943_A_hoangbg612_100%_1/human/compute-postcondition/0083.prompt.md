Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the elements of the original list N and the values are the counts of each element, k is undefined, cnt is an empty list, stdin contains T - 3 test cases. If the sum of the values in dictionary M is equal to S, then cur is the last element of the original list N plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the first key in `M`, `cnt` is a list with one element which is the first key in `M` if the value of `M[k]` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is an empty list, stdin contains `T - 3` test cases. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the second key in `M`. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0. `cnt` is a list with one element which is the second key in `M` if the value of `M[k]` is not 1, otherwise `cnt` is a list with two elements where the first element is the second key in `M` and the second element is the second key in `M`. stdin contains `T - 3` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the third key in `M`. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0. `cnt` is a list with two elements where the first element is the third key in `M` and the second element is the third key in `M` if the value of `M[k]` is not 1, otherwise `cnt` is a list with three elements where the first element is the third key in `M`, the second element is the third key in `M` and the third element is the third key in `M`. stdin contains `T - 3` test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
