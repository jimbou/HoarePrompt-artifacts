Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is an empty list, cur is the last element in the original list N, M is a dictionary where the keys are the elements in the original list N and the values are the number of times each element appears in the list N, stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list N will be empty because the loop iterates over all elements in the list. The variable cur will be set to the last element in the original list N. The dictionary M will contain all the elements from the original list N as keys, and the values will be the number of times each element appears in the list N. The other variables T, S, and stdin remain unchanged.
