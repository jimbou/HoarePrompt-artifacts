Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary, stdin contains T - 1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable S is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is now empty. The list N is assigned the sorted list of integers from the second line of the test case, and cur is assigned the value -1. The dictionary M is initialized as an empty dictionary. Stdin now contains T - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer, and the second line contains a list of integers.
