Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list N, cur is equal to num, M[cur] is 1, and stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`, which is the third element in the sorted list `N`. The value of `M[cur]` has been set to 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1, regardless of the previous value of `cur` and `num`. All other variables, including `T`, `S`, and the list `N`, remain unchanged.
