Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It processes each list by sorting it, identifying the longest contiguous subsequence, and then finding the smallest missing number in that subsequence. If the smallest missing number is not present in the original list, it is incremented by 1. If there are multiple single-element subsequences, the function returns the second smallest missing number. Otherwise, it returns the smallest missing number. The function prints the result for each test case.**
