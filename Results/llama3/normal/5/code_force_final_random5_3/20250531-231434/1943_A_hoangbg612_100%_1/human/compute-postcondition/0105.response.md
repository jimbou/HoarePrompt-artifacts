Postcondition: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list. If num is greater than cur, then cur is updated to num and M is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is either the first integer in the list or -1 and the value is 1, and another key-value pair where the key is equal to num and the value is 1. Otherwise, cur remains either the value of the first integer in the list or -1, and M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either the first integer in the list or -1 and the value is 2. In both cases, k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.**
