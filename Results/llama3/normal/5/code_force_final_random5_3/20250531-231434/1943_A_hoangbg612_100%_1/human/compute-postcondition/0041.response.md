Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `cur` is the second element in the list `cnt`, `M` is a dictionary with at least `len(M)` key-value pairs, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, `k` is the last key in the dictionary `M`, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be the second element in the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `cnt` still contains all keys `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, and `k` is still the last key in the dictionary `M`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `T - 1`.
