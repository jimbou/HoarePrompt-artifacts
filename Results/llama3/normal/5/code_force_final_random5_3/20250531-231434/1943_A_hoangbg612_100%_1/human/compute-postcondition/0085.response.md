Output State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the last key in `M`, `cnt` is a list with two or more elements where each element is a key in `M` with a value of 1, `cur` is the second element of `cnt`, stdin contains `T - 3` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `T` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive). The value of `S` also remains unchanged, still an integer equal to the input value. The list `N` and dictionary `M` also remain unchanged, with `N` having at least one element and `M` having at least one key-value pair where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0. The last key in `M` is still `k`. The list `cnt` remains unchanged, with two or more elements where each element is a key in `M` with a value of 1. The value of `cur` is now the second element of `cnt`. The number of test cases in stdin remains `T - 3`.
