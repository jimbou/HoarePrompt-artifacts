Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the third element of N and the value is 1 if num > cur, otherwise the value is increased by 1 if the third element of N is greater than the current value, otherwise the key is the second element of N and its value is increased by 1 if the second element of N is greater than -1, otherwise the key is -1 and its value is increased by 1, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 4 test cases, and cur is the third element of N if the third element of N is greater than the current value, otherwise cur is either the second element of N if the second element of N is greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1, num is the third element in the list.***
