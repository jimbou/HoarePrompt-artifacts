Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is an empty list, cur is the last element in the original list N plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise cur remains the last element in the original list N, M is a dictionary where the keys are the elements in the original list N and the values are the number of times each element appears in the list N, cnt is an empty list, stdin contains T - 1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of T, S, N, cur, and M remain unchanged. A new empty list cnt is created. The number of test cases in stdin remains T - 1.
