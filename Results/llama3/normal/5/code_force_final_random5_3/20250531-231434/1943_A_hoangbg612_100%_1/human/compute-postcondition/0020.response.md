Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list N. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is set to num + 1, M[cur] is 1, and stdin contains T - 2 test cases. Otherwise, if num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num, M[cur] is 1, and stdin contains T - 1 test cases. If num is not greater than cur, then M[cur] is incremented by 1, and stdin contains T - 1 test cases.***
