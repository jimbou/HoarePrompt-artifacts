Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
3.  It sorts the array `N` in ascending order.
4.  It initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will keep track of the current maximum value that can be included in the array `c` to maximize the MEX.
5.  It creates a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each number in the array `N`.
6.  It iterates over the sorted array `N`. If the current number is greater than `cur`, it checks if the current number is greater than `cur + 1`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it sets `cur` to the current number and increments its frequency in the dictionary `M`.
7.  If the sum of frequencies in the dictionary `M` is equal to the size of the array `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
8.  It creates a list `cnt` to store the numbers with frequency 1 in the dictionary `M`.
9.  If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it sets `cur` to the second element of `cnt`.
10. Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which represents the maximum MEX that can be achieved.

The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the MEX by including the smallest possible numbers in the array `c` and avoiding the largest possible numbers. The use of the dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each number and the list `cnt` to store the numbers with frequency 1 is efficient and effective.

Correctness: **True**
