Output State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the last key in `M`, `cnt` is a list with one or more elements where each element is a key in `M` with a value of 1, stdin contains `T - 3` test cases. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* `T` remains an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive).
* `S` remains an integer equal to the input value.
* `N` remains a list with at least one element.
* `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0.
* `k` is the last key in `M`.
* `cnt` is a list with one or more elements where each element is a key in `M` with a value of 1.
* stdin contains `T - 3` test cases.
* If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0.

Note that the only changes from the initial state are the values of `k` and `cnt`, which are updated based on the loop iterations. The other variables remain unchanged.
