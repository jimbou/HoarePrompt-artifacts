Output State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the third key in `M`. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0. `cnt` is a list with two elements where the first element is the third key in `M` and the second element is the third key in `M` if the value of `M[k]` is not 1, otherwise `cnt` is a list with three elements where the first element is the third key in `M`, the second element is the third key in `M` and the third element is the third key in `M`. stdin contains `T - 3` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `cnt` has been updated to include the third key in `M` as its last element. If the value of `M[k]` is not 1, `cnt` now has two elements, both of which are the third key in `M`. If the value of `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` now has three elements, all of which are the third key in `M`.
