Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `cur` is the last element in the original list `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element in the original list `N`, `M` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, `cnt` is a list containing the first key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, the second key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, and the third key `k` in the dictionary `M`, `k` is the third key in the dictionary `M`, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated to include the third key `k` from the dictionary `M`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` now includes the first key `k` if `M[k]` equals 1, the second key `k` if `M[k]` equals 1, and the third key `k`. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties.
