Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers, M is an empty dictionary, k is undefined, cur is -1, stdin contains T - 3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element of N and the value is 1 if the first element of N is greater than cur, otherwise M is a dictionary with cur as a key and its value is increased by 1, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, and cur is either the first element of N if the first element of N is greater than cur, otherwise cur is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second element of N and the value is 1 if the second element of N is greater than the current value, otherwise M is a dictionary with the first element of N as a key and its value is 2 if the first element of N is greater than -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with -1 as a key and its value is increased by 1, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, and cur is the second element of N if the second element of N is greater than the current value, otherwise cur is either the first element of N if the first element of N is greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1, num is the second element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the third element of N and the value is 1 if num > cur, otherwise the value is increased by 1 if the third element of N is greater than the current value, otherwise the key is the second element of N and its value is increased by 1 if the second element of N is greater than -1, otherwise the key is -1 and its value is increased by 1, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 4 test cases, and cur is the third element of N if the third element of N is greater than the current value, otherwise cur is either the second element of N if the second element of N is greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1, num is the third element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
