To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `N` has at least one more integer. At the end of the last iteration, `N` has at least 2 integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least 3 integers, and `num` must be the third integer in the list.

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, `cur` is either the value of the first integer in the list or -1, `M` is a dictionary with either two or three key-value pairs, `k` is not defined, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains no input.**
