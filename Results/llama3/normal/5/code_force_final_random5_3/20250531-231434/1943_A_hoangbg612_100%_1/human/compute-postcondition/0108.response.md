Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is either the value of the first integer in the list or 0. Otherwise, cur remains either the value of the first integer in the list or -1. M is a dictionary with either two or three key-value pairs, k is not defined, _ is 1, and stdin contains no input.***
