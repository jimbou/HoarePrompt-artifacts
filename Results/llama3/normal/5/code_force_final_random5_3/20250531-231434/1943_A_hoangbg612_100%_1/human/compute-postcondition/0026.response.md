Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is an empty list, cur is the last element in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where the keys are the elements in the original list N and the values are the number of times each element appears in the list N, stdin contains T - 1 test cases. The current value of the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T remains the same, S remains the same, N remains an empty list, the value of cur is incremented by 1, M remains the same, and the number of test cases in stdin is still T - 1.
