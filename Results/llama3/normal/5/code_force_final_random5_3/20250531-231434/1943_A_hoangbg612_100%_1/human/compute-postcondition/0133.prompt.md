Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer, N is a list with at least one element, M is a dictionary with at least len(M) key-value pairs, k is the last key in the dictionary M, stdin contains T - 1 test cases. If there are at least two keys k in the dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, then cur is the second element in the list cnt. Otherwise, cur remains the last element in the original list N plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise cur remains the last element in the original list N. The value of cur is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the last key in `M`. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0. If the length of `cnt` is 2 or more, `cnt` is a list with two or more elements where each element is a key in `M` with a value of 1, and `cur` is the second element of `cnt`. Otherwise, no changes are made. stdin contains `T - 3` test cases, and the value of `cur` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is an empty list, num is not defined, M is a dictionary that must have at least as many keys as the number of iterations of the loop, k is the last key in the dictionary M. If the value of M[k] is 1 and cnt has at least two elements, then cnt is a list containing at least two elements, where the last key k of dictionary M has a value of 1, and cur is equal to the second element of cnt. Otherwise, cnt remains an empty list, and the value of cur is being printed, where cur is equal to the second element of cnt if cnt has at least two elements and the value of M[k] is 1, otherwise cur is undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
