Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is an empty list, num is not defined, cnt is an empty list, if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals the input value S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1, otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**

In this output state, a new variable `cnt` is introduced and assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the sum of the values in dictionary M and the value of `cur` are still applicable.
