Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `cur` is the last element in the original list `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element in the original list `N`, `M` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `cnt` is a list containing the first key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, and the second key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, otherwise `cnt` remains an empty list, `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases.**
