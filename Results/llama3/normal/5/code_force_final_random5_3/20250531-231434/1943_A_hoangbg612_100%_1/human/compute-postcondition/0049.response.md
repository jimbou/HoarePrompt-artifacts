Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `k` is undefined, `cur` is -1, stdin contains T - 3 test cases. The first element in the list, `num`, is greater than the current value of `cur`, which is -1, and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**
