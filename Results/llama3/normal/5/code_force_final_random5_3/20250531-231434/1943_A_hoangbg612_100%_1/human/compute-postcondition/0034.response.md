Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `cur` is the last element in the original list `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element in the original list `N`, `M` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `cnt` is a list containing the first key `k` in the dictionary `M` if `M[k]` equals 1, and the second key `k` in the dictionary `M`, `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `cnt` now contains the second key `k` from the dictionary `M`, in addition to the first key `k` if its value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
