Postcondition: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second element of N and the value is 1 if the second element of N is greater than the current value, otherwise M is a dictionary with the first element of N as a key and its value is 2 if the first element of N is greater than -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with -1 as a key and its value is increased by 1, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, and cur is the second element of N if the second element of N is greater than the current value, otherwise cur is either the first element of N if the first element of N is greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1, num is the second element in the list.**
