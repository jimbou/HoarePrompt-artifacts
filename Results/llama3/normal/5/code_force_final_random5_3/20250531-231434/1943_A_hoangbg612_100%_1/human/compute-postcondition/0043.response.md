Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the value of `cur`.

To determine the value of `cur`, we need to consider the conditions that affect its value.

1. If there are at least two keys `k` in the dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1, then `cur` is the second element in the list `cnt`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the list `cnt`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `cur` in this case.

2. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is the last element in the original list `N` plus 1. However, the initial state does not provide information about the values in dictionary `M` or the list `N`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `cur` in this case.

3. If none of the above conditions are met, then `cur` remains the last element in the original list `N`.

Since we do not have enough information to determine the exact value of `cur`, we can only describe its value based on the conditions provided.

Output: **the value of cur, which is either the second element in the list cnt if there are at least two keys k in the dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, or the last element in the original list N plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, or the last element in the original list N otherwise**
