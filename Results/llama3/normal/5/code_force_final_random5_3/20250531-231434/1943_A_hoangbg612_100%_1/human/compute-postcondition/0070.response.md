Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is an integer equal to the input value, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where the keys are the elements of the original list N and the values are the counts of each element, k is undefined, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, and cur is the last element of the original list N plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. The sum of the values in dictionary M is equal to S.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), S is still an integer equal to the input value, N is still an empty list, M is still a dictionary where the keys are the elements of the original list N and the values are the counts of each element, k is still undefined, stdin still contains T - 3 test cases, and cur is the last element of the original list N plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. The sum of the values in dictionary M is still equal to S.
