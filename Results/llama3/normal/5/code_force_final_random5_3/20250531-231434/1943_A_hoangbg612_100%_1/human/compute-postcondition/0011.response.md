Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list `N`, stdin contains `T - 1` test cases. If `num` is greater than the initial value of `cur` (-1), then `cur` is updated to the first element in the list `N`, and `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in the list `N` and the value is 1. Otherwise, a `KeyError` is raised because `M` does not have a key `-1`.***
