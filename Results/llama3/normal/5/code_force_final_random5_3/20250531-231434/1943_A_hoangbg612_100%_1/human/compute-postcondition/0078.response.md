Output State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `S` is an integer equal to the input value, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where the key is an element of `N` and the value is greater than 0, `k` is the second key in `M`, `cnt` is a list with two elements where the first element is the second key in `M` if the value of `M[k]` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is a list with one element which is the second key in `M`, and the second element is the second key in `M`, stdin contains `T - 3` test cases. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of the original list `N` plus one if it is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` remains the same, `S` is still equal to the input value, `N` and `M` are unchanged, `k` is still the second key in `M`. The list `cnt` now has two elements: the first element is the second key in `M` if the value of `M[k]` is 1, otherwise it is an empty list, and the second element is the second key in `M`. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same. The value of `cur` is still dependent on the sum of the values in dictionary `M` and the last element of the original list `N`.
