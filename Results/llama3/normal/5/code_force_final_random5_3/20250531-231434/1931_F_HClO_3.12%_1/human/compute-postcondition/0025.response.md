Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is an integer such that (`i` + max(`p1`, `p2`) equals `n` - 1), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
