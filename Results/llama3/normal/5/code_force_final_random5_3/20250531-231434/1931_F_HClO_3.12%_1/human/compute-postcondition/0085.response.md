To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is at least 1, meaning `m` must be at least 3.

State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be at least 3, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3) if idx1 >= idx2, otherwise val is an empty list. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1, l is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then l1 is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers excluding a2. l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 excludes a1. l is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers including a1 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then m is 1 less than its original value.**
