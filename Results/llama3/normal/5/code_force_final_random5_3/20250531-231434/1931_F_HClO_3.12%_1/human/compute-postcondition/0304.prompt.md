Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is n-1, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, l1 is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is n-1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, p1 is 1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise p1 is 0, p2 is 0 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p2 is 1 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise p2 is 1, t, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3) if idx1 is not greater than idx2, otherwise val is an empty list, l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val if idx1 is not greater than idx2, otherwise l3 is assigned a value from the input. If idx1 is greater than idx2, m is an integer, otherwise m is an integer decreased by 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is n-1, m is an integer greater than 2 decreased by 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, l1 is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is n-1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, p1 is 1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise p1 is 0, p2 is 0 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p2 is 1 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise p2 is 1, t, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, m is an integer decreased by 1, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is n-1, m is an integer greater than 3 decreased by 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, l1 is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is n-1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, p1 is 1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise p1 is 0, p2 is 0 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p2 is 1 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise p2 is 1, t, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, m is an integer decreased by 1, _ is 1, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is n-1, m is an integer greater than 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, l1 is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is n-1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, p1 is 1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise p1 is 0, p2 is 0 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p2 is 1 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise p2 is 1, t, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, _ is 1, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
