To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable in the loop head is `m`. The loop will execute again if `m - 2` is greater than the current iteration number.

At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `m - 2` must be greater than the current iteration number. Since the loop has already executed once, the current iteration number is 1. Therefore, `m - 2` must be greater than 1, which means `m` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, and `l11` and `l22` are not equal**
