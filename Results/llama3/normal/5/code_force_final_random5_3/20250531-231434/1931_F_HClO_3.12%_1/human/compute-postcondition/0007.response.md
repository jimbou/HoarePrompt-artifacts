The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are currently inside a loop that processes the test cases, the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the current test case and move on to the next test case.

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m` are not affected by the `continue` statement. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases, but the current test case is skipped.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `m` is 1, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, and we move on to the next test case.**
