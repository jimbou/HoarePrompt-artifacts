Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is i, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, and p2 is 0. Otherwise, if both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l1[i + p1] equals a2, then idx1 is set to i, p1 is set to 1, and idx2 remains -1. If l1[i + p1] does not equal a2, then idx1 remains -1, p1 remains 0, and idx2 is set to i. In all cases, if i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of l1[i + p1] is not equal to the current value of l2[i + p2]. Either l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 or l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is `i + 1`, `p1` is 1, and `idx2` is -1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2`, then `idx1` is -1, `p1` is 0, and `idx2` is `i + 1`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. Additionally, if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than some value + 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `i` is some value + 1, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is some value. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, or continues its execution otherwise, while maintaining the initial values and relationships of the variables. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues its execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
