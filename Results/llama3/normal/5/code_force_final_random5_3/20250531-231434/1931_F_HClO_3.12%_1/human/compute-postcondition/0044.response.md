Output State: **idx1 is i, idx2 is i**

The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied to be an integer. The assignment of `i` to `idx1` and `idx2` does not depend on any conditions or previous values of these variables. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `idx1` and `idx2` will both have the value of `i`.
