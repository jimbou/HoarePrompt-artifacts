To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a3`, `l3`, and `val`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple of `(a3, l3)`, the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of `(a3, l3)`, `l1` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` excludes `a1`, `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a2` at index `idx1`, `stdin` is empty, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val**
