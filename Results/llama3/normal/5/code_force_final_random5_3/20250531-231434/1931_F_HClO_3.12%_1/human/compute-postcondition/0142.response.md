Postcondition: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t`, `n` must be at least 2, `m`, `i` is 0, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. The current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n` minus 1. The element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in `l2`. Either the element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is not equal to `a2` or the element at index `i + p2` in `l2` is not equal to `a1`. If the element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1. Additionally, both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0.**
