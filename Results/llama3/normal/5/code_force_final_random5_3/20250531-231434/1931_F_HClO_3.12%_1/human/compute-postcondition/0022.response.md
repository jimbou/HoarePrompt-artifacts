Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0**

The code initializes two variables, idx1 and idx2, to -1, and two other variables, p1 and p2, to 0. The initial state remains unchanged, with t, n, m, stdin, a1, a2, l1, l2, l11, and l22 retaining their original values. The new variables idx1, idx2, p1, and p2 are added to the state with their assigned values.
