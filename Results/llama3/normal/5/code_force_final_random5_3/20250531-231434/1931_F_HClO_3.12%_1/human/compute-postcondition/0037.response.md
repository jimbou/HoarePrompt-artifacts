Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`. The current value of `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and the current value of `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then the current value of `idx1` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 1, and `idx2` remains -1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx1` remains -1, `p1` remains 0, and the current value of `idx2` is set to `i`. In both cases, if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`. Either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions and relationships between the variables also remain the same. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
