Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, l1 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l1 remains unchanged, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, t, val is a list containing m-2 tuples (a3, l3), l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val. If l11 is not equal to l22, m is greater than or equal to 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values, and 'yes' is printed if m equals 1.**

The code snippet sets `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0. This means that the indices for inserting elements into lists `l1` and `l2` are reset to -1, indicating that no insertion will occur at these indices. The flags `p1` and `p2` are also reset to 0, indicating that no specific conditions are met for inserting elements into `l1` and `l2`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
