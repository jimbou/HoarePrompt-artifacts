To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable in the loop head is `m`. The loop will execute again if the current iteration is less than `m - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is an integer greater than 3. To execute the loop again, `m` must be greater than the current iteration plus 2.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, we don't need to adjust its state.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, and `l11` and `l22` are not equal**
