The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` accepts two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. Since `t` is an integer greater than 0 and stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers, the first test case is read and `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the first two integers of the first test case. The remaining input is still in stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers.**
