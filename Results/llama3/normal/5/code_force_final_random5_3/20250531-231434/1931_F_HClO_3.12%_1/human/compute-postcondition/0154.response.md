Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n` must be at least 2, `m`, `i` is 1, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is `i`, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is `i`, `p2` is 1, and `p1` is either 0 or 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions related to `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are still valid, but we exit the loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
