Postcondition: ***`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `t`, `n` must be at least `2`, `m` equals `2`, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `l` is unchanged, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, and 'yes' is printed if `m` equals `2`. The current value of `l3` has `a1` at a lower index than `a2`.***
