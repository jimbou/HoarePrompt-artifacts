Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is n-1, m is an integer greater than 2 decreased by 1, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, l1 is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is n-1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, p1 is 1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise p1 is 0, p2 is 0 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p2 is 1 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise p2 is 1, t, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, m is an integer decreased by 1, _ is 0**

The code executes a single line that assigns the value of the input to `a3` and `l3`. The value of `m` is decreased by 1. The value of `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on the value of `l1[i + p1]`. The value of `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the value of `l1[i + p1]` and `idx1` and `idx2`. The value of `l` is updated based on the value of `idx1` and `idx2`. The value of `l3` is assigned a value from the last tuple in `val`. The value of `m` is decreased by 1. The value of `_` remains 0.
