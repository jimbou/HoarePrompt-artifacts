Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers including a1 and excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, l3 is a list of integers containing both a1 and a2 and the index of a1 is less than the index of a2, l is a list of integers including a1 and excluding a2.**

The code inserts `a1` at index `idx2` in list `l1`, making `l1` include `a1` and exclude `a2`. The second line assigns the modified `l1` to a new variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
