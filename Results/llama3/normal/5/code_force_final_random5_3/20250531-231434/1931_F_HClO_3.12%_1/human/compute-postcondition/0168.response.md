Postcondition: ***`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n` must be at least 3, `m`, `i` is 2, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, no changes occur. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, no changes occur. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, then the program continues to execute. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
