Postcondition: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `t`, `n` must be at least `2`, `m`, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then the current value of `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is `0`, and `p2` is `0`. Otherwise, the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n` minus `1`. The element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in `l2`. Either the element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is not equal to `a2` or the element at index `i + p2` in `l2` is not equal to `a1`. If the element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is equal to `a2`, then the current value of `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is `1`. Otherwise, the current value of `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is `1`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to `0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement. Additionally, the current value of `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**
