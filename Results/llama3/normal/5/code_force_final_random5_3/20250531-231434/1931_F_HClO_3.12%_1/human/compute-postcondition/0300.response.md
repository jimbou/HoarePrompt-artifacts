The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is an integer greater than 2 decreased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer greater than 3 decreased by 1, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is assigned a value from the last tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` remains unchanged, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n-1` if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `p2` is 1, `t`, `val` is a list containing a tuple of `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l3` is assigned a value from the last tuple in `val`, `m` is an integer decreased by 1, `_` is 1**
