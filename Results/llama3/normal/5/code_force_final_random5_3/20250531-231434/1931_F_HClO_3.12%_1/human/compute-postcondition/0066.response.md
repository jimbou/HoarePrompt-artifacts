Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, l2 is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1, l is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1.**

The code first inserts the value of `a2` at the index `idx1` in the list `l2`, effectively adding `a2` to `l2` at the specified position. Then, it assigns the modified list `l2` to a new variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
