Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, stdin contains no input, t, n, m, idx1, idx2, p1, p2, i, val, l, a3, l3 are unchanged
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `stdin` contains no input, `t`, `n`, `m` must be at least 3, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged, and a value has been returned from the input function.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `stdin` contains no input, `t`, `n`, `m` must be at least 5, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged, and a value has been returned from the input function and stdin now contains an input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n`, `m` must be at least 6, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
