Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is `i + 1`, `p1` is 1, and `idx2` is -1. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `p1` is 0, and `idx2` is `i + 1`.**
