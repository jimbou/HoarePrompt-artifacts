Postcondition: ***`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t`, `n` must be at least 2, `m`, `i` is 1, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
