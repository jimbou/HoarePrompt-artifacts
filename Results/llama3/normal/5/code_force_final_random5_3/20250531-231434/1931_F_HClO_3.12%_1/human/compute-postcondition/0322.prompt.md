Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines, each containing n integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m == 1:
        input()
        print('yes')
        continue
    a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())
    a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())
    l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]
    l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]
    if l11 != l22:
        for _ in range(m - 2):
            input()
        print('no')
        continue
    idx1 = idx2 = -1
    p1 = p2 = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
            break
        if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
                idx1 = idx2 = i
                break
            else:
                if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                    idx1 = i
                    p1 = 1
                else:
                    idx2 = i
                    p2 = 1
                if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                    break
    val = []
    if idx1 < idx2:
        l2.insert(idx1, a2)
        l = l2
    elif idx1 > idx2:
        l1.insert(idx2, a1)
        l = l1
    else:
        if m == 2:
            print('yes')
            continue
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):
            l1.insert(idx2, a1)
            l = l1
        else:
            l2.insert(idx1, a2)
            l = l2
        val.append((a3, l3))
        m -= 1
    for _ in range(m - 2):
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        val.append((a3, l3))
    for a3, l3 in val:
        if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
            print('no')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` excludes `a1`, `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a2` at index `idx1`, `stdin` is empty, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If `val` is empty, then 'yes' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, l1 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l1 remains unchanged, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, t, n must be at least 2, m is at least m, i is n-2, val is a list containing m-2 tuples (a3, l3), l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, and 'yes' is printed if m equals 2, _ is m-2, stdin contains no input. If l3 is not equal to the list of integers in l excluding a3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 'no' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is n-1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 2 decreased by (m - 2), a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is the first element in the last tuple in val, l1 is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is n-1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise idx2 is i if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, p1 is 1 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p1 is 0 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise p1 is 0, p2 is 0 if l1[i + p1] equals a2, otherwise p2 is 1 if l1[i + p1] does not equal a2 but idx1 is not less than idx2, otherwise p2 is 1, t, val is an empty list, l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is the second element in the last tuple in val, _ is m - 3, stdin is empty. If l3 is not equal to the list of integers in l excluding a3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 'no' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues execution without printing 'no' and 'yes' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
