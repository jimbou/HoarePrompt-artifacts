To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`, which means we are iterating over the tuples in the `val` list. The loop will execute again if there are more tuples in `val` to process.

At the end of the previous iteration, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of `(a3, l3)`. To execute the loop again, `val` must contain at least 2 tuples.

The only objects in the loop head are variables `a3`, `l3`, and `val`, so we can only adjust those ones.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `l1` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` excludes `a1`, `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a2` at index `idx1`, `stdin` is empty, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`.**
