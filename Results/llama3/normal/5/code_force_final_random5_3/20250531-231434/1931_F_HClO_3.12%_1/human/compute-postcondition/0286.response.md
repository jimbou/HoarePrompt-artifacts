Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer with a current value of 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is assigned a value from the last tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` remains unchanged, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n-1` if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `p2` is 1, `t`, `val` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l3` is assigned a value from the last tuple in `val`. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is updated to `n-1` if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx1` is updated to 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx1` is updated to -1, and `idx2` is updated to -1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is updated to `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx2` is updated to `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`. `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and 'yes' is printed**
