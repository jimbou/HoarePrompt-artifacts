Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing m - 2 tuples of (a3, l3), l1 is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers excluding a2. l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 excludes a1. l is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers including a1 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of `(a3, l3)`, `l1` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` excludes `a1`, `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a2` at index `idx1`, `stdin` is empty, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If the current value of `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `l1` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` excludes `a1`, `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a2` at index `idx1`, `stdin` is empty, `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `l1` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` excludes `a1`, `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a2` at index `idx1`, `stdin` is empty, `a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
