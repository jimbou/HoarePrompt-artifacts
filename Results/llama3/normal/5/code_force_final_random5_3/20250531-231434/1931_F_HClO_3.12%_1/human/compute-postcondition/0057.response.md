Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer that must be greater than some value + 1, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, i is some value + 1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is i, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is 1. If i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 equals n minus 1, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues its execution.**

The code modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, so `idx2` becomes `i`. The second line assigns the value `1` to `p2`, so `p2` becomes `1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, and `idx1` remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on the values of `i`, `p1`, and `p2`.
