Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `t`, `n` must be at least 2, `m`, `i` is 0, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, and the second line sets `p2` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
