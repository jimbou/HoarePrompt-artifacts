Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 with a2 inserted at index idx1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, l is a list of integers excluding a1 with a2 inserted at index idx1, stdin contains no input. The index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3.**

The code modifies the list `l2` by inserting the value `a2` at the index `idx1`. This changes the composition of `l2`, which now includes `a2` at the specified position. The variable `l` is then assigned the modified list `l2`, so `l` also includes `a2` at the index `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as described in the precondition.
