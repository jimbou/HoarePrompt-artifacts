The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 5, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 5.
State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `stdin` contains no input, `t`, `n`, `m` must be at least 5, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged, and a value has been returned from the input function.**
