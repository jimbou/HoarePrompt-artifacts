Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n and m are integers, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of `n` and `m` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2 because two lines of input are consumed by the code. The variables `a1` and `a2` are assigned integer values from the input. The lists `l1` and `l2` are created by mapping the remaining input values to integers, excluding the first value of each line. The lists `l11` and `l22` are created by filtering out the values of `a2` and `a1` from `l1` and `l2`, respectively.
