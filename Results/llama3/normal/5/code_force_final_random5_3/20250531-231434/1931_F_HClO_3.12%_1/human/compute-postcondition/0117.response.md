To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` (although it's a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly) and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 3 (since we're looping `m - 2` times).

State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `stdin` contains no input, `t`, `n`, `m` must be at least 3, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged**
