Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers including a1, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, l is a list of integers including a1.**

The code first inserts `a1` at index `idx2` in list `l1`, effectively adding `a1` to `l1`. Then, it assigns the modified `l1` to a new variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
