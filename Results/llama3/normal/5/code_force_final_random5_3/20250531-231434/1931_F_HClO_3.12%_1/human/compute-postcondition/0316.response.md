To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`, which means we are iterating over the tuples in the `val` list. The loop will execute again if there are more tuples in `val` to iterate over.

From the given state, we know that `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, and we have already iterated over the first tuple. To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next tuple in `val`.

The only state that needs to be adjusted is the tuple being iterated over, which is `(a3, l3)`. Since we have already iterated over the first tuple, we need to move to the next tuple in `val`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 decreased by `(m - 2)`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element in the third tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` remains unchanged, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n-1` if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `p2` is 1, `t`, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `l` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l3` is the second element in the third tuple in `val`, `_` is `m - 3`, `stdin` is empty.**
