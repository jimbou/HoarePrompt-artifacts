Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than some value + 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `i` is some value + 1, `idx1` is either `i` or some value, `idx2` is either `i` or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is some value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and conditions, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
