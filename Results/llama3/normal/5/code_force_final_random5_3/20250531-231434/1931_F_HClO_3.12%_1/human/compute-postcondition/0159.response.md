Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n` must be at least 3, `m`, `i` is 2, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
