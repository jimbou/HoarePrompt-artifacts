Output State: **a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, t, n must be at least 2, m, i is 0, val, l, a3, l3 are unchanged. The current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 does not equal n minus 1. The element at index i + p1 in l1 is not equal to the element at index i + p2 in l2. Either the element at index i + p1 in l1 is not equal to a2 or the element at index i + p2 in l2 is not equal to a1. The current value of the element at index i + p1 in l1 is equal to a2.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1` and sets `p1` to 1. This means that `idx1` is now equal to the current value of `i`, and `p1` is set to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
