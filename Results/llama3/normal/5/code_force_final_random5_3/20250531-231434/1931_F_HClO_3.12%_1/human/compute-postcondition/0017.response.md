Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, and `l11` and `l22` are not equal**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the value of `m` is now greater than or equal to 2 (since the loop has finished executing), and the number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by `m-2` (since the loop consumes `m-2` test cases). The values of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
