Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `stdin` contains no input, `t`, `n`, `m` must be at least 3, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged, and a value has been returned from the input function.**

The code `input()` accepts a line of input from the user, but since `stdin` contains no input, this line of code will wait for the user to enter a line of input. Once the user enters a line of input and presses enter, the `input()` function will return the entered line as a string. The returned value is not assigned to any variable, so it is discarded. The state of all other variables remains unchanged.
