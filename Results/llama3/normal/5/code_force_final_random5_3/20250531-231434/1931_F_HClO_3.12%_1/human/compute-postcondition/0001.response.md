To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution directly). However, since `_` is not used in the loop body, we can ignore it.

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines, each containing n integers.**
