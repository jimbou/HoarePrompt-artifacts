The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is some value + 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than some value + 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than some value + 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `i` is some value + 1, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is some value**
