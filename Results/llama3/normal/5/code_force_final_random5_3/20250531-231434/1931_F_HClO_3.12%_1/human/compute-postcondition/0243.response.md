Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is assigned a value from the last tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` remains unchanged, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `t`, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l3` is assigned a value from the last tuple in `val`. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or the current value of `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`***
