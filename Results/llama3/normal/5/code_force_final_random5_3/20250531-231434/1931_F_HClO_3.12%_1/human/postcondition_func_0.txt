This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines whether a specific condition is met for each test case. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints 'yes' or 'no' to indicate whether the condition is satisfied for each test case. The function processes the input in a specific format, expecting an integer t followed by t test cases, each containing two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers. It then performs a series of comparisons and insertions on the input data to determine the outcome for each test case.
