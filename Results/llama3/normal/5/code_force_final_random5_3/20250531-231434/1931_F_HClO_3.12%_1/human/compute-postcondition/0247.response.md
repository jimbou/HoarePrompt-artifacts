Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val, l1 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l1 remains unchanged, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 1, t, val is a list containing m-2 tuples (a3, l3), l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is assigned a value from the last tuple in val. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The current value of l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2**

The code modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The value of `idx2` is updated to `i`, which is 0. The value of `p2` is updated to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
