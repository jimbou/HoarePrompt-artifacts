Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1. If l11 and l22 are not equal, 'no' is printed and the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the rest of the code inside the current loop.***
