To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the loop iterates over the range `n - 1`. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2 and `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `t`, `n` must be at least 2, `m`, `i` is 0, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged**
