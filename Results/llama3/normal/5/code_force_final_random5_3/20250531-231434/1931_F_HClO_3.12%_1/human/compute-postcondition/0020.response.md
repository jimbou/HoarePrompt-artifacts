Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, and `l11` and `l22` are not equal, and 'no' is printed, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1, and we move to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the code inside the current loop.
