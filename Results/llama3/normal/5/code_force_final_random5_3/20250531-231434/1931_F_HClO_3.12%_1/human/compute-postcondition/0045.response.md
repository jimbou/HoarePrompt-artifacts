Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer that must be greater than 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is i + 1, p1 is 1, idx2 is -1, and p2 is 0.**

The provided code snippet only contains two lines, which modify the values of `idx1` and `p1`. The initial state's conditions and constraints remain valid, as none of the other variables are affected by the code. The value of `idx1` is set to `i`, and `p1` is set to 1. The values of `idx2` and `p2` are not explicitly modified in the code, so they retain their initial values of -1 and 0, respectively.
