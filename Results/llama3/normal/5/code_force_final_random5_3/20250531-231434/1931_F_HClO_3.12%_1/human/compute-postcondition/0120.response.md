Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `stdin` contains no input, `t`, `n`, `m` must be at least 5, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged, and a value has been returned from the input function and stdin now contains an input.**

In this output state, all the variables remain unchanged as the input function does not modify any variables. However, since the input function has been called, stdin now contains an input, and a value has been returned from the input function.
