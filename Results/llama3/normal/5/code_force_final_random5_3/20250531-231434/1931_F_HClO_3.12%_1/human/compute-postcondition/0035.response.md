Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, then idx1 is set to i, p1 is set to 1, and idx2 remains -1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2, then idx1 remains -1, p1 remains 0, and idx2 is set to i. In both cases, if i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of l1[i + p1] is not equal to the current value of l2[i + p2]. Either l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 or l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1.***
