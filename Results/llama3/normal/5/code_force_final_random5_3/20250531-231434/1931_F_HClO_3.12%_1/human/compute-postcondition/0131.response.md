Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `t`, `n` must be at least 2, `m`, `i` is 0, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. The current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The relationship between `i`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remains the same, where the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1.
