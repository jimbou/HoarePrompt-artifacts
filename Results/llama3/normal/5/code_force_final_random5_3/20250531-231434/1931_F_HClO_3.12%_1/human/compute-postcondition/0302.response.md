To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `m` is an integer greater than 3 decreased by 2, which means `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is not important, and we don't need to adjust its state.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is assigned a value from the last tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` remains unchanged, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n-1` if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `p2` is 1, `t`, `val` is a list containing a tuple of `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l3` is assigned a value from the last tuple in `val`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
