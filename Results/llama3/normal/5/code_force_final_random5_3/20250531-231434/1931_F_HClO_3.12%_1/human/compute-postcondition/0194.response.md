Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l1 remains unchanged, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 remains unchanged, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, t, n must be at least 2, m is at least 4, i is n-1, val is a list containing two tuples (a3, l3), l is a list of integers with either a1 inserted at index idx2 or a2 inserted at index idx1, l3 is a list of integers, and 'yes' is printed if m equals 2, _ is 1, stdin contains no input.**

The code block reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. It then appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `l`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `val` is updated to contain two tuples. The value of `l3` is updated to be a list of integers. Stdin is now empty.
