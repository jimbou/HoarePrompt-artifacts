Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n` must be at least 3, `m`, `i` is 2, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. `idx1` is 2, `p1` is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`, making `idx1` equal to 2. It also assigns the value 1 to `p1`. No other variables are affected by the code.
