Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i + 1`, `idx2` is `i + 1`, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0. Otherwise, if both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i + 1`, `p1` is set to 1, and `idx2` remains -1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2`, then `idx1` remains -1, `p1` remains 0, and `idx2` is set to `i + 1`. In all cases, if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Additionally, the current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`. Either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged. The conditions for `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` are still valid, but we break out of the loop or if statement.
