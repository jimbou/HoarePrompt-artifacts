Postcondition: ***`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n` must be at least 2, `m`, `i` is 1, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
