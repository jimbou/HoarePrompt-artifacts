Output State: **a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, t, n is at least 2, m equals 2, i is n-2, val is an empty list, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers with a1 at a lower index than a2, and 'yes' is printed if m equals 2.**

The code inserts the value of `a1` at index `idx2` in the list `l1`. This changes the state of `l1` to include `a1` at the specified index. The second line assigns the modified list `l1` to the variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `l3` still has `a1` at a lower index than `a2` as the code does not modify `l3`. The condition for printing 'yes' is still met since `m` equals `2`.
