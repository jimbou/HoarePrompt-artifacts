Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 4, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, and `l11` and `l22` are not equal**

The code `input()` accepts one input from `stdin`, which contains `t-5` test cases. After accepting one input, `stdin` now contains `t-6` test cases. The values of the other variables are not affected.
