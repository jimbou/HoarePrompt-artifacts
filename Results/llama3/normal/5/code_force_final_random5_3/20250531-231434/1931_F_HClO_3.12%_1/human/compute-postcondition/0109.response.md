The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` excludes `a1`, `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers including `a2` at index `idx1`, `stdin` is empty, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined. If `val` is empty, then 'yes' is printed.**
