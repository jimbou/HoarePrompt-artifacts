To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`, which means we are iterating over the tuples in the `val` list. The loop will execute again if there are more tuples in `val` to iterate over.

From the given state, we know that `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple, and the first tuple has been processed in the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `val` must have at least 2 tuples.

The only objects in the loop head that need to be adjusted are `a3`, `l3`, and `val`. Specifically:

* `a3` should be the first element of the second tuple in `val`.
* `l3` should be the second element of the second tuple in `val`.
* `val` should have at least 2 tuples.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `i`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 decreased by `(m - 2)`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is the first element in the second tuple in `val`, `l1` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` remains unchanged, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n-1` if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `idx2` is `i` if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0 if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `p2` is 1, `t`, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `l` is a list of integers with either `a1` inserted at index `idx2` or `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l3` is the second element in the second tuple in `val`, `_` is `m - 3`, `stdin` is empty. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
