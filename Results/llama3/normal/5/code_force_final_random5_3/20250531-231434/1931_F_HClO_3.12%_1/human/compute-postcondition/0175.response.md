Output State: **a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, t, n must be at least 2, m, i is n-2, val is an empty list, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, a3, l3 are unchanged.**

The code inserts the value of `a1` at index `idx2` in the list `l1`. This changes the value of `l1` and also affects the value of `l`, which is assigned the new value of `l1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
