Output State: **a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, t, n, m, i, val, l, a3, l3 are unchanged.**

The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0. The values of `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, and `l3` are also unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
