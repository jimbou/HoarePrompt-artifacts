Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l1`, `l2`, `l`, `stdin`, `a3`, `l3` are as described in the precondition. If `m` is 1, 'yes' is printed, an input is accepted from the user but not stored in any variable, 'yes' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `m` is not 1, no action is taken.**
