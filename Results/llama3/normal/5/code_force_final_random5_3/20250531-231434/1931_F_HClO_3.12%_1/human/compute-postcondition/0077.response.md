Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, stdin contains no input. The current value of `l3` contains both `a1` and `a2` and the index of `a1` is less than the index of `a2`***
