The code `input()` accepts a single line of input from stdin. Since stdin contains `t-1` test cases, and each test case starts with two integers `n` and `k`, the first line of input will be accepted and removed from stdin. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `m` is 1, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers.**
