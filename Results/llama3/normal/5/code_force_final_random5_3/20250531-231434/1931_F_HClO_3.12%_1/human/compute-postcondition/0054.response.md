Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than some value + 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `i` is some value + 1, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is some value. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues its execution.***
