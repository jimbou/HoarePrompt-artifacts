Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n` must be at least 3, `m`, `i` is 2, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of a loop or if statement.
