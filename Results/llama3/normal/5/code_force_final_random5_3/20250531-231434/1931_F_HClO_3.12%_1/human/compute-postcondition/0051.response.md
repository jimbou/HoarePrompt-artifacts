Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is `i + 1`, `p1` is 1, and `idx2` is -1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2`, then `idx1` is -1, `p1` is 0, and `idx2` is `i + 1`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. Additionally, if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. Either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.***
