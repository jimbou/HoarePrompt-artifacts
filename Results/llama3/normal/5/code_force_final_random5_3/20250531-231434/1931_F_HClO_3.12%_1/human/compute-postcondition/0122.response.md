Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n`, `m` must be at least 6, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged, stdin is empty**

The code `input()` accepts an input from the user, but does not assign it to any variable. As a result, the input is discarded, and the stdin is now empty. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
