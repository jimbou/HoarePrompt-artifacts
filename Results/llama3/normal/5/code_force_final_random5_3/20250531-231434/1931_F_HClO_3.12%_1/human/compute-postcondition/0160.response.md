Postcondition: ***`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n` must be at least 3, `m`, `i` is 2, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
