To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` (a throwaway variable, not actually used) and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 3, because the range is `m - 2` and the loop needs at least one iteration to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, and `l11` and `l22` are not equal**
