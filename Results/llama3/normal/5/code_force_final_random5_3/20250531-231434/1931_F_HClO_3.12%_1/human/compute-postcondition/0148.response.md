Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t`, `n` must be at least 2, `m`, `i` is 1, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
