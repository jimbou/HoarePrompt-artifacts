Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines, each containing n integers.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is the number of test cases. The stdin now contains the remaining input, which includes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers.
