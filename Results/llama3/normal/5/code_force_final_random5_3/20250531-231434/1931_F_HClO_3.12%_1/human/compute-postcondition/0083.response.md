Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), `l3` is a list of integers containing both `a1` and `a2`, `l` is a list of integers. If `idx1` > `idx2`, then `l1` is a list of integers including `a1`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, and `l` is a list of integers including `a1`. Otherwise, `m` is 1 less than its original value, and if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` includes `a1` and excludes `a2`, and `l2` excludes `a1`. Otherwise, `l1` excludes `a2`, `l2` excludes `a1` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.***
