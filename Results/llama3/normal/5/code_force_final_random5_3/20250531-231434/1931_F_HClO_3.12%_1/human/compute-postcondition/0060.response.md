Postcondition: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, or continues its execution otherwise, while maintaining the initial values and relationships of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`.**
