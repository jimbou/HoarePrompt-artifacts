Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and `val` remain the same as in the initial state. The new variables `a3` and `l3` are introduced, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
