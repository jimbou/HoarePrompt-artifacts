Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l2` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either -1 or some value, `idx2` is either -1 or some value, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `val` is introduced, which is an empty list. The values of the other variables are not affected by the code, so they retain their initial values.
