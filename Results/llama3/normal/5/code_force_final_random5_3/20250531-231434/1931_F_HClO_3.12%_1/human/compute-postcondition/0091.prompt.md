Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3) if idx1 >= idx2, otherwise val is an empty list. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1, l is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then l1 is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers excluding a2. l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 excludes a1. l is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers including a1 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then m is 1 less than its original value.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), l1 is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers excluding a2. l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 excludes a1. l is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers including a1 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be at least 3, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing two tuples of (a3, l3), l1 is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers excluding a2. l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 excludes a1. l is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers including a1 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be at least 4, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n - 1, val is a list containing three tuples of (a3, l3), l1 is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l1 is a list of integers excluding a2. l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l2 is a list of integers excluding a1 with a2 inserted at index idx1 if the index of a1 in l3 is greater than or equal to the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l2 excludes a1. l is a list of integers including a1 if idx1 > idx2, otherwise l is a list of integers including a1 if the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, otherwise l is a list of integers including a2 at index idx1, stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
