Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers excluding `a1`, `t`, `n`, `m` must be at least `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l`, `a3`, `l3` are unchanged, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
