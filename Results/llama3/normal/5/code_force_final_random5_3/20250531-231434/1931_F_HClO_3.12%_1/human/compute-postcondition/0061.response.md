Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer that must be greater than some value + 1, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers excluding a2, l2 is a list of integers excluding a1, l11 is a list of integers excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers excluding a1, i is some value + 1, idx1 is either -1 or some value, idx2 is either -1 or some value, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is some value. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is set to i and idx2 is set to i. Otherwise, the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if both idx1 and idx2 are non-negative, or continues its execution otherwise, while maintaining the initial values and relationships of the variables.***
