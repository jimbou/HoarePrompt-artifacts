Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.
