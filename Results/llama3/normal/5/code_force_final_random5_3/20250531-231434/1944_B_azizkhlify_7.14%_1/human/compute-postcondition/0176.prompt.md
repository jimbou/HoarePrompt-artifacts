Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`, `ul` is either `k * 2` or `2 * n`, `ur` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by `n` for all `i` in range `n` and `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by `n` for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 1, and nothing is printed. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by `n` for all `i` in range `n` and `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by `n` for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `2 * n` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is either 0 or `2 * n`, `_` is 1, and nothing is printed. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n + 1`, then the value of `a[i]` which is the last element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. The current value of `k` is not zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `re` is equal to `k`, or continues to execute when `re` is not equal to `k`. In both cases, the values of `i`, `n`, `ul`, `ur`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `res`, and `_` remain unchanged, and nothing is printed. Additionally, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n + 1`, the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the value of `a[i]` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is increased by 1, `n` remains unchanged. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then the value of `re` is increased by 1 and the value of `a[i]` is appended to the list `res`. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is increased by 1, `n` remains unchanged. If the value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 1, then the value of `a[i]` is printed, `re` is increased by 1, and `res` contains the element at index `i` in the list `a`. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
