Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(`min(n, k)`), stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `k` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(`min(n, k)`). If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains an additional element `a[i]` and `re` is 1. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. If the current value of `re` is equal to `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is less than n and i is increased by 1, k is a non-zero value, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 1 for all j in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 2 for all j in range(n), ul is 2 * min(n, k), ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[j] printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all j in range(min(n, k)). If l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then res contains an additional element a[i] and re is 1 + 1 = 2. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n` and `i` is increased by 1, `k` is a non-zero value, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is 2 * min(`n`, `k`), `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(`n`, `k`)). If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains an additional element `a[i]` and `re` is 1 + 1 = 2. If `re` is equal to `k`, then the value of `a[i]` is printed with no newline at the end and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
