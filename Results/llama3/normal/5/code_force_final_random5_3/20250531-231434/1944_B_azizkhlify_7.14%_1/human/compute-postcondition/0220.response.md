To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` and `r` are lists of `n` zeros, `ul` and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input**
