Based on the precondition, the code will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* `a` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is an integer greater than 0.
* `i` is 2, which means we're accessing the third element of the list `a` (since indexing starts at 0).
* `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[2]`, which is the third element of the list `a`.
* The `print` statement prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.

Since we don't know the exact values of the elements in the list `a`, we can't provide a numerical value for `a[i]`. However, we can describe the output as:

Output: **the third element of the list a, the third element of the list a**
