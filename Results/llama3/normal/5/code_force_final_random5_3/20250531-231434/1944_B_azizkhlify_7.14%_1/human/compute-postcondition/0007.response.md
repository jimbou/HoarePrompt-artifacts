Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input, `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` at index `a[2] - 1` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2, and the input in `stdin` is reduced by one line.
