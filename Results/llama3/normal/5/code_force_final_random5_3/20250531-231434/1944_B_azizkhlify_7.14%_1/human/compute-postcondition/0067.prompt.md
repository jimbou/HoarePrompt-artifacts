Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is a non-zero integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input. The current value of `k` is not zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is a non-zero integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 1 or 0, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]`, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `re` equals `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is a non-zero integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 1 or 0, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]`, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is 1 and `res` is a list containing the value of `a[1]`. If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is a non-zero integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 1 or 0 or 2 or `k + 1`, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]` or a list containing the value of `a[2]`, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, and `i` is 2. If `re` equals `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is 2 or `k + 1` and `res` is a list containing the value of `a[2]`. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
