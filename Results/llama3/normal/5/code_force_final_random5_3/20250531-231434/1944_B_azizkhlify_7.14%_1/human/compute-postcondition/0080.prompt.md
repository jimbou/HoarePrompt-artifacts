Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]` or a list containing the value of `a[2]` or ... or a list containing the value of `a[n-1]`, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, and `i` is `n`. If `k` is non-zero, then `re` is either 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k` and `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]` or a list containing the value of `a[2]` or ... or a list containing the value of `a[n-1]`. If `re` equals `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is 2 or `k + 1` and `res` is a list containing the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, and `i` is the first element in the list res, and the first element of the list res which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, and `i` is the second element in the list res, and the second element of the list res which is i is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, and `i` is the third element in the list res, and the third element of the list res which is i is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
