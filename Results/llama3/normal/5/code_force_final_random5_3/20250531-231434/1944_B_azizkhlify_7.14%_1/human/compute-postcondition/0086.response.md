Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2 * n, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 2, `_` is 0, and `i` is the last element in the list res, and the last element of the list res which is `i` is printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`. The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. The value of `a[i]` which is the last element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ur` has been incremented by 2, making it 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
