Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is `4 * k - 2 * min(n, k)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(`min(n, k)`), stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to `4 * k - 2 * min(n, k)`, which is a new expression based on the initial values of `k` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains no input.
