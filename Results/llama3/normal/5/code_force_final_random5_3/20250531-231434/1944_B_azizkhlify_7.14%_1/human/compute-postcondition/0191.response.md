According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of all elements in the list `res` have been printed, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now `n`. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal, which does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`res` is a list with all elements printed, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
