Based on the precondition, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`

Here, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `i` is equal to `2 * n + 1`.

Since `i` is greater than the length of the list `a` (which is `n`), `a[i]` will raise an "IndexError: list index out of range" exception.

However, since the `end` parameter is set to `' '`, the print statement will not print a newline character at the end.

Therefore, the output will be an error message indicating that the index is out of range, followed by a space.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
