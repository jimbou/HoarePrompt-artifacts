The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is the first element of the list `a`. The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is initially 0, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[0] - 1` is 1 and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `ul` and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input**
