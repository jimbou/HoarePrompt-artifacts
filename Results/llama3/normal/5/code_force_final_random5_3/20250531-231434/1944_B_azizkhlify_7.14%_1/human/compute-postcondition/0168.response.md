Postcondition: ***`i` is increased by 1, `n` remains unchanged. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then the value of `re` is increased by 1 and the value of `a[i]` is appended to the list `res`. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues.***
