Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n+1`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is 2 and the rest are 0, `ul` and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input**

The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is `n+1`, `a[i]` is out of range for list `a`. However, `a[i] - 1` is still a valid index for list `r`. The element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is initially 1, and after the increment, it becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
