Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 1 for all j in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 2 for all j in range(n), `ul` is 2 if the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input. If the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2 and `ul` is equal to `k` multiplied by 2, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[1]` has been printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing has been printed, and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[1]` has been printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.**
