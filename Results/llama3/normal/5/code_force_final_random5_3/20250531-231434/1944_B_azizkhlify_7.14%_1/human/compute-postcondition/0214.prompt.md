Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has finished executing, and the values of all elements in the list `res` have been printed. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`res` is a list with all elements printed, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`res` is a list with all elements printed, `i` is `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing is changed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`res` is a list with all elements printed, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, then if `r[a[n+2] - 1]` equals 2, `i` is `n+4`, the value of `a[n+2]` is printed twice with a space in between, and `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `i` remains `n+2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
