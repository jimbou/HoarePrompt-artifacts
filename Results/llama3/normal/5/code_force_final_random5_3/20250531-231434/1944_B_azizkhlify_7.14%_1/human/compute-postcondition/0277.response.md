The code prints the value of `a[i]`, which is the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is less than `n` and is increased by 1, the value of `a[i]` will be the next element in the list `a` after the previous iteration.

Output: **the value of a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
