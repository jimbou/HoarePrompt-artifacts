Postcondition: **The program executes as follows: if `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, and nothing is printed. If `ul` is not equal to `k * 2`, then the program continues to execute. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n + 1`, then the value of `a[i]` which is the last element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is either 2 or `k * 2 + 2`, `ur` is 0, and the last element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.**
