The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.
Since `i` is `n+1`, and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1. Therefore, the code will print the element at index `n+1` of the list `a` twice.
Output: **a[n+1] a[n+1]**
