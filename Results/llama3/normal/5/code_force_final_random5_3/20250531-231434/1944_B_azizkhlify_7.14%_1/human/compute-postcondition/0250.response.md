State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 1 for all j in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 2 for all j in range(n), `ul` is 4 if the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[1]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.**
