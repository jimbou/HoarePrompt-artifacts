Output State: **`res` is a list with all elements printed, `i` is `n+4`, `n` is greater than 0, and this is printed: the value of `a[i]` which is `a[n+2]` is printed twice with a space in between, and `ur` is increased by 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to `n+4` because `ur` was increased by 2. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and the list `res` still contains all elements printed. Additionally, the value of `a[n+2]` is still printed twice with a space in between.
