To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`. This means that the loop will iterate as long as `i` is within the range `[n, 2 * n)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n+1`, which means that the loop has already executed once. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to the next value in the range.

Since `n` is greater than 0, the range `[n, 2 * n)` is non-empty, and there are more values for `i` to take.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` to the next value in the range. The next value of `i` would be `n+2`.

The other variables, `res`, `ul`, and `ur`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`res` is a list with all elements printed, `i` is `n+2`, `n` is greater than 0**
