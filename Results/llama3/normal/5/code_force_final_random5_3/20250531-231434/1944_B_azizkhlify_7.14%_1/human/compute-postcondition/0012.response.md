Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n` and `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is `n+1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input**

In this output state, the value of `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1, because the code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` is executed with `i` equal to `n+1`, which is out of range of the list `a`, but since `a` is a list of `n` integers, `a[n]` is the last element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
