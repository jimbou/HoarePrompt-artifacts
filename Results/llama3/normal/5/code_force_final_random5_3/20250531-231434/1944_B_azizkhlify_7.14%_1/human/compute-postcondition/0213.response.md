Postcondition: ***`res` is a list with all elements printed, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, then if `r[a[n+2] - 1]` equals 2, `i` is `n+4`, the value of `a[n+2]` is printed twice with a space in between, and `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `i` remains `n+2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
