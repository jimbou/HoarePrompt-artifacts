State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value of `a[1]` (because `i` is 1) is printed twice, separated by a space and `ul` is set to 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
