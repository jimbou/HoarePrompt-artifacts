Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 1 for all j in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 2 for all j in range(n), `ul` is 2 if the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input. If the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[0]` has been printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end. The current value of `ul` is equal to `k` multiplied by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, and the conditions on the lists `l` and `r` are still valid. The value of `ul` is still equal to `k` multiplied by 2, and if the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, the value of `a[i]` has been printed twice.
