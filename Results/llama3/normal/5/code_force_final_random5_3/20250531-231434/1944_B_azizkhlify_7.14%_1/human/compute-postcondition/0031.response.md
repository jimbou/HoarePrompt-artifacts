Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.
