Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then prints pairs of identical integers from the first n integers, followed by single integers from the first n integers, and finally prints the single integers again. The function repeats this process for each test case, ensuring that the number of printed pairs and single integers meets the specified conditions.**
