State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is less than n and i is increased by 1, k is a non-zero value, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 1 for all j in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 2 for all j in range(n), ul is 2 * min(n, k), ur is 0, res is a list containing the value of a[j] printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all j in range(min(n, k)). If l[a[i] - 1] is 1, then res contains an additional element a[i] and re is 1 + 1 = 2. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. If re is equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
