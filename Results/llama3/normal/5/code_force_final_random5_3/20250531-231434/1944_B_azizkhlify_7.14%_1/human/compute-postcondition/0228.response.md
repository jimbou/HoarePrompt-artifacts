Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is 1 and the rest are 0, `ul` and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated. The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is now 1, and the rest of the elements are 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
