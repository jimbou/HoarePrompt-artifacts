According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If stdin contains at least 1 test case, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, stdin must contain at least 1 test case and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
