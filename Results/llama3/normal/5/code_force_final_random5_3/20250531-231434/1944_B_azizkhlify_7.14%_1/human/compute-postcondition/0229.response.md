The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2*n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n+1`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is 1 and the rest are 0, `ul` and `ur` are 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input**
