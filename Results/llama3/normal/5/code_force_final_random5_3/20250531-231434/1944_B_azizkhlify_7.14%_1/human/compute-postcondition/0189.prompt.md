Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`. If `k` is true, the loop has finished executing. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for any `i` in range `n`, then the value of `a[i]` is printed, `re` is increased by 1, and `res` contains the element at index `i` in the list `a`. If `re` equals `k`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues. If `k` is false, the program does nothing. and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is an element in the list `res`, `res` is not empty, `n` is equal to `i`, `k` is true, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for some `i` in range `n`, `re` is less than `k`, `res` contains the element at index `i` in the list `a`, and the value of `i` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is an element in the list `res`, `res` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `n` is equal to `i`, `k` is true, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for some `i` in range `n`, `re` is less than `k`, `res` contains the element at index `i` in the list `a`, and the value of `i` is printed, and the value of `i` which is equal to `n` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is an element in the list `res`, `res` is not empty and has at least 1 element, `n` is equal to `i`, `k` is true, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 for some `i` in range `n`, `re` is less than `k`, `res` contains the element at index `i` in the list `a`, and the value of `i` is printed, and the value of `i` which is equal to `n` is printed, and the value of `i` which is equal to `n` is printed again




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
