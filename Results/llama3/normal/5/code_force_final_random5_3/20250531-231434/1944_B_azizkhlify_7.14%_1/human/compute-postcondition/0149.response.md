Postcondition: ***`ul` is either 4 or `k * 2 + 4` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` is either 2 or `k * 2 + 2`. `ur` is 0, `a` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is a list of elements that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `l` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the 3rd element of the list `a` which is `a[2]` is printed twice.***
