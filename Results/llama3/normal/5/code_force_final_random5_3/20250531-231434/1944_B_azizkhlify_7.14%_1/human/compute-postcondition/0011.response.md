The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2*n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 1.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is `n+1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input**
