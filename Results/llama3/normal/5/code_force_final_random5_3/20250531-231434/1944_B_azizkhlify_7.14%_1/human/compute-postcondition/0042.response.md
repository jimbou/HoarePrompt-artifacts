Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that the value of `k` is updated to be twice its original value minus `ul`. The other variables remain unchanged.
