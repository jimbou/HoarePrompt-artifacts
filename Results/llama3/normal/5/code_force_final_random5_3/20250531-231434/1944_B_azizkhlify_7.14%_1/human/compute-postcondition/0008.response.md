Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `l` will have its elements incremented by 1 at the indices corresponding to the values in list `a`, minus 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop finishes executing.
