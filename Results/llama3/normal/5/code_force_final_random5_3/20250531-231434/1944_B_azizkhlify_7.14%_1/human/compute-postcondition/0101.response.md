Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n + 1`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 2, `_` is 0, `i` is `2 * n + 1`, and an "IndexError: list index out of range" is raised because `i` is greater than the length of list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ur` is incremented by 2, resulting in `ur` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still has the same constraints and values for `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `res`, `ul`, and `_`. However, an "IndexError: list index out of range" is raised because `i` is greater than the length of list `a`.
