Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input, `ul` is either 2 or `k * 2 + 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `ul` has been incremented by 2. If `ul` was equal to `k * 2` before, it is now `k * 2 + 2`. If `ul` was 0 before, it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
