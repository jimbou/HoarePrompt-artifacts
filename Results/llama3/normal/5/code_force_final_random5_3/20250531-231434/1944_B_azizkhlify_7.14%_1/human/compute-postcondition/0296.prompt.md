Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)). If `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. , and a newline is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first element in the list `res`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)) that must not be empty, and if `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second element in the list `res`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)) that must not be empty, and if `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the third element in the list `res`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)) that must not be empty and has at least one more element, and if `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
