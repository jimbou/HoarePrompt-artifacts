Output State: **`res` is a list with all elements printed, `i` is `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ur` is increased by 2, and this is printed: the value of `a[i]` which is out of bounds since `i` is `n+1` and the value of `a[i]` which is out of bounds since `i` is `n+1`**

In this output state, the value of `ur` has been increased by 2, while the values of `res`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The print statements remain the same, indicating that the value of `a[i]` is still out of bounds since `i` is still `n+1`.
