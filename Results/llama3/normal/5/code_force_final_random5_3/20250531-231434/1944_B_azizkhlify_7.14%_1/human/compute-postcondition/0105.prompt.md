Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, and `i` is the last element in the list res, and the last element of the list res which is `i` is printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `_` is 0, and the last element of the list res which is `i` is printed. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is the last element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n + 1`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `_` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute, and `i` is `2 * n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the last element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n + 1`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `_` is 0, and `i` is `2 * n + 1`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
