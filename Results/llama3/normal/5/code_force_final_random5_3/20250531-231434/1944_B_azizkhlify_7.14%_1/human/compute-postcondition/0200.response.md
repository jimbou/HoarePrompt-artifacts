The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2*n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`res` is a list with all elements printed, `i` is `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0**
