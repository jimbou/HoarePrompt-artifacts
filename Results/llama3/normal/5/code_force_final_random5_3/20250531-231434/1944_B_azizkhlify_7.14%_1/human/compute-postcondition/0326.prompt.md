Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, and nothing is printed. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `2 * n` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is either 0 or `2 * n`, `_` is 0, and nothing is printed. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is the last element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has finished executing, and the values of all elements in the list `res` have been printed. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are equal, and a new line is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element in the list `res`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)) that must not be empty and has at least one more element, and if `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is printed. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `n` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `min(n, k) + n`, `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is `2 * min(n, k)`, and nothing is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
