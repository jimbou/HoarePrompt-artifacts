The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range object, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range object. If the range object has at least one more iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has finished executing, and the values of all elements in the list `res` have been printed. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are equal, and a new line is being printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the range object must have at least one more iteration.
State: **The loop has finished executing, and the values of all elements in the list `res` have been printed. The current values of `ul` and `ur` are equal, and a new line is being printed, the range object has at least one more iteration**
