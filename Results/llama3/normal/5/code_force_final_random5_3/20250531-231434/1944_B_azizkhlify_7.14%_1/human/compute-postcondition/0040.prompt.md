Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is `2 * n`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `r` will have its elements incremented by 1 for each index corresponding to the elements in list `a` from index `n` to `2 * n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value of `a[0]` (because `i` is 0) is printed twice, separated by a space and `ul` is set to 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value of `a[1]` (because `i` is 1) is printed twice, separated by a space and `ul` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ul` remains either 0 or `k * 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is either 2 or `k * 2 + 2` and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value of `a[2]` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, `ul` remains either 0 or `k * 2`. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
