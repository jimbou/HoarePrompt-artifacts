Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is either 2 or `k * 2 + 2` and the value of `a[i]` which is equal to the value of `a[2]` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, `ul` remains either 0 or `k * 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.
