Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by n for all i in range n and l[a[0] - 1] is incremented by n, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by n for all i in range 2 * n, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, `res` is a list that must have at least n elements, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is 0, `_` is 1, and nothing is printed. If ul is not equal to ur, then n is an integer that must be at least 2, k is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by n for all i in range n and l[a[0] - 1] is incremented by n, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by n for all i in range 2 * n, re is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, res is a list that must have at least 2 * n elements, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 0 or 2 * n, _ is 1, and nothing is printed. If r[a[i] - 1] is n + 1, then the value of a[i] which is the last element of the list a is printed twice, separated by a space. If ul is equal to ur, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. The current value of l[a[i] - 1] is 2.**
