Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is a non-zero integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 1 or 0, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]`, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition for `re` and `res` still holds, meaning that if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then `re` is 1 and `res` contains the value of `a[i]`, otherwise, `re` is 0 and `res` is an empty list.
