Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element in the list `res`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)) that must not be empty and has at least one more element, and if `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is printed. The current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, otherwise `ur` is 2, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)) that must not be empty and has at least one more element, and if `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is printed. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then the current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur`, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)) that must not be empty and has at least one more element, and if `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is printed. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then the current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur`, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`, and the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n + 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ur` is 2, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)) that must not be empty and has at least one more element, and if `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and the first element of the list `res` which is `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is being printed, and the value of `i` is printed. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then the current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur`, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the current value of `ul` is not equal to the current value of `ur`, and the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end, and the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
