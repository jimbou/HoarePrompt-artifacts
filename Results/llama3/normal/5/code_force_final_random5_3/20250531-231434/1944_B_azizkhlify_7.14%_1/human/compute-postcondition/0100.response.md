Output: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n + 1`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `_` is 0, `i` is `2 * n + 1`, and the value of `a[i]` which is out of range of list `a` is printed twice with a space in between, resulting in an "IndexError: list index out of range" because `i` is greater than the length of list `a`**
