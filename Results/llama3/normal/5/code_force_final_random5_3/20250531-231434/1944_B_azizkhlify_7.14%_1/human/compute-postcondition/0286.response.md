Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 1 for all `j` in range(`n`) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[j] - 1` is 2 for all `j` in range(`n`), `ul` is `2 * min(n, k)`, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[j]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end for all `j` in range(min(n, k)). If `k` is non-zero and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `res` contains additional elements `a[i]` and `re` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. , and a newline is printed**
