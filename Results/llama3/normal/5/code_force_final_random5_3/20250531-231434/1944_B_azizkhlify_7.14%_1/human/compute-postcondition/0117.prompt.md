Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer that must be at least 1, k is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range n, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range 2 * n, re is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, res is a list that must have at least n elements, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is 0, _ is 1, and nothing is printed. If ul is not equal to ur, then n is an integer that must be at least 2, k is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range n, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range 2 * n, re is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, res is a list that must have at least 2 * n elements, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 0 or 2 * n, _ is 1, and nothing is printed. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then the value of a[i] which is the last element of the list a is printed twice, separated by a space. If ul is equal to ur, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    l[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range n and l[a[0] - 1] is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range 2 * n, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, `res` is a list that must have at least n elements, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is 0, `_` is 1, and nothing is printed. If ul is not equal to ur, then n is an integer that must be at least 2, k is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range n and l[a[0] - 1] is incremented by 1, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range 2 * n, re is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, res is a list that must have at least 2 * n elements, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 0 or 2 * n, _ is 1, and nothing is printed. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then the value of a[i] which is the last element of the list a is printed twice, separated by a space. If ul is equal to ur, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 2 for all i in range n and l[a[0] - 1] is incremented by 2, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range 2 * n, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, `res` is a list that must have at least n elements, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is 0, `_` is 1, and nothing is printed. If ul is not equal to ur, then n is an integer that must be at least 2, k is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 2 for all i in range n and l[a[0] - 1] is incremented by 2, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range 2 * n, re is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, res is a list that must have at least 2 * n elements, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 0 or 2 * n, _ is 1, and nothing is printed. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then the value of a[i] which is the last element of the list a is printed twice, separated by a space. If ul is equal to ur, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 3 for all i in range n and l[a[0] - 1] is incremented by 3, `r` is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range 2 * n, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, `res` is a list that must have at least n elements, `ul` is either 0 or k * 2, `ur` is 0, `_` is 1, and nothing is printed. If ul is not equal to ur, then n is an integer that must be at least 2, k is an integer that is equal to 2 * k - ul, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where l[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 3 for all i in range n and l[a[0] - 1] is incremented by 3, r is a list of n integers where r[a[i] - 1] is incremented by 1 for all i in range 2 * n, re is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or k + 1 or k, res is a list that must have at least 2 * n elements, ul is either 0 or k * 2, ur is either 0 or 2 * n, _ is 1, and nothing is printed. If r[a[i] - 1] is 2, then the value of a[i] which is the last element of the list a is printed twice, separated by a space. If ul is equal to ur, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
