Output State: **`res` is a list with all elements printed, `i` is `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `res`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not affect their values. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
