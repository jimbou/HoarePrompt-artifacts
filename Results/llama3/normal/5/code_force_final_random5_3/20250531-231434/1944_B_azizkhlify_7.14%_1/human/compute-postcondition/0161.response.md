Postcondition: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `re` is equal to `k`, or continues to execute when `re` is not equal to `k`. In both cases, the values of `i`, `n`, `ul`, `ur`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `res`, and `_` remain unchanged, and nothing is printed. Additionally, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is `n + 1`, the value of `a[i]` is printed twice, separated by a space, and if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the value of `a[i]` is printed.**
