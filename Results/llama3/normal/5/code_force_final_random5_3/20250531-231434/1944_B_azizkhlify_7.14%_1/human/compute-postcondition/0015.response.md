Output State: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `i` is `2 * n`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has iterated over the range from `n` to `2 * n`, incrementing the corresponding indices in the list `r` for each iteration. The other variables remain unchanged.
