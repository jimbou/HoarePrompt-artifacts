Based on the precondition, the code prints the value of `a[i]`, which is the element at index `i` in the list `a`, followed by a space, with no newline at the end.

Since `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a[i]` is a valid index in the list `a`. The value of `a[i]` is an integer, as specified in the precondition.

Additionally, the precondition states that the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, which means that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 1. However, this information is not directly related to the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a[i]`, followed by a space, with no newline at the end.

Output: **[a[i]] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
