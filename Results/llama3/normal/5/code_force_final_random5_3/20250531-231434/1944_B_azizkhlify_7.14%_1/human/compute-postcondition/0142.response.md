Postcondition: ***`ul` is either 2 or `k * 2 + 2`, `ur` is 0, `a` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is a list of elements that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `l` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer. If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 2, then `ul` is either 4 or `k * 2 + 4`, and the 2nd element of the list `a` which is `a[1]` is printed twice with a space in between. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
