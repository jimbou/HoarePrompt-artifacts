The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`ul` is either 2 or `k * 2 + 2`, `ur` is 0, `a` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is a list of elements that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `l` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer**
