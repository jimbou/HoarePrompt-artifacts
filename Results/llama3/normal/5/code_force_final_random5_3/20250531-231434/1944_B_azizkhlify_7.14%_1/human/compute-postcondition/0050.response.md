Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `k` is a non-zero integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is equal to `k`, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]`, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 lines of input. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then `re` is 1 and `res` contains the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, `re` is 0 and `res` is an empty list.***
