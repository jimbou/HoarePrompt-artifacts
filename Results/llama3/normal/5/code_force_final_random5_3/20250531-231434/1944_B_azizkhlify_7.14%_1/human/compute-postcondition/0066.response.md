Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is a non-zero integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n`, `re` is either 1 or 0 or 2 or `k + 1`, `res` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a[i]` or a list containing the value of `a[2]`, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is 0, `_` is 0, and `i` is 2. If `re` equals `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is 2 or `k + 1` and `res` is a list containing the value of `a[2]`. Otherwise, the values of `re`, `res`, `ul`, `ur`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
