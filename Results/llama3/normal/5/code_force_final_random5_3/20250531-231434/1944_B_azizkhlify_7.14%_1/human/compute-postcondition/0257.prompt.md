Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is 2n, k is an integer, a is a list of n integers, l is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 1 for all j in range(n) and the rest are 0, r is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 2 for all j in range(n), ul and ur are 0, res is an empty list, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 1 for all j in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 2 for all j in range(n), `ul` is 2 if the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, stdin contains no input. If the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2 and `ul` is equal to `k` multiplied by 2, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[0]` has been printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, nothing has been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 1 for all j in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 2 for all j in range(n), `ul` is 4 if the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2 and `ul` is equal to `k` multiplied by 2, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[1]` has been printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end. Otherwise, the value of `a[i]` which is equal to `a[1]` has been printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `l` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 1 for all j in range(n) and the rest are 0, `r` is a list of n integers where the element at index a[j] - 1 is 2 for all j in range(n), `ul` is 6 if the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, otherwise `ul` is 4, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the value of `a[1]` printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end, and if the current value of `l` at index `a[i] - 1` is 2, the third element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
