State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `k` is an integer that is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is a list of `n` integers where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `n`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` in range `2 * n + 1`, `re` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `k + 1` or `k`, `res` is a list that must have at least `n + 1` elements, `ul` is either 0 or `k * 2`, `ur` is either 0 or 2, `_` is 0, and the last element of the list res which is `i` is printed. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then the value of `a[i]` which is the last element of the list `a` is printed twice, separated by a space. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute, and `i` is `2 * n`**
