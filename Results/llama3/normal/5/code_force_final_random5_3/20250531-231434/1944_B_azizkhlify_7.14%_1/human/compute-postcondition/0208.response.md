Based on the initial state, `res` is a list with all elements printed, `i` is `n+2`, and `n` is greater than 0.

The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Here, `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it's a list or an array.

Since `i` is `n+2`, and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2.

The print statement is printing the element at index `i` of list `a` twice, with a space in between.

Since `res` is a list with all elements printed, we can assume that the elements of `a` are also printed.

However, the exact elements of `a` are not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of `a[i]`.

Based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the element at index `i` of list `a` twice, with a space in between.

Output: **a[n+2] a[n+2] (where a[n+2] is the element at index n+2 of list a)**
