The code prints the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.
Since `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, `a[i]` is out of range of the list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the value of a[i] which is out of range of the list a)**
