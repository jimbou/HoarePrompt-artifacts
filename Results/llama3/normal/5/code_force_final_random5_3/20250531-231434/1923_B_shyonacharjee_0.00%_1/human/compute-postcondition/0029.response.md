Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, i is 0, position is the position of the first monster, health is the health of the first monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, bullets_needed is the health of the first monster. If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is greater than time_available, then success is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
