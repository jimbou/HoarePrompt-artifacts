Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n, x_i != 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned a positive integer value from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 1 and 3 * 10^5, and `k` is between 1 and 2 * 10^9. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, each between 1 and 10^9. The third line contains `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`, where each `x_i` is between `-n` and `n`, and `x_i` is not equal to 0. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
