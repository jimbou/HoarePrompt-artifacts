Based on the initial state, the print statement will print either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the value of the variable `success`.

The variable `success` is a boolean value that is determined by the condition `total_bullets_used <= abs(position)`. Here, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all monsters, and `abs(position)` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster.

Since the exact values of `total_bullets_used` and `position` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `success`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'YES' if `success` is True (i.e., `total_bullets_used` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the position of the last monster) or 'NO' if `success` is False (i.e., `total_bullets_used` is greater than the absolute value of the position of the last monster).

Output: **YES if total_bullets_used is less than or equal to the absolute value of the position of the last monster, otherwise NO**
