Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, `i` is 0, `position` is the position of the first monster, `health` is the health of the first monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the first monster, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, if `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `healths`, `positions`, `monsters`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` remain unchanged. The value of `total_bullets_used` is increased by the value of `bullets_needed`. If the new value of `total_bullets_used` plus `bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, then `success` is set to False. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs.
