Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, total_bullets_used is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, i is 0, position is an integer, health is an integer, distance is a non-negative integer, time_available is a non-negative integer, bullets_needed is a positive integer. If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is greater than time_available, then success is False. Otherwise, success remains True.***
