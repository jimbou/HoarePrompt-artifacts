Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `i` is 1, `position` is an integer, `health` is an integer, `distance` is a non-negative integer, `bullets_needed` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False. Otherwise, `success` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total_bullets_used` has been increased by the value of `bullets_needed`. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still has multiple test cases to process, minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers. The value of `success` depends on the new value of `total_bullets_used` and the value of `time_available`. If the new value of `total_bullets_used` plus `bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, then `success` is False; otherwise, `success` remains True.
