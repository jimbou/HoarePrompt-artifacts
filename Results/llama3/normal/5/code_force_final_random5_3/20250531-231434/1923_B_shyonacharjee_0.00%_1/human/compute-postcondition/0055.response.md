Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, i is 1, position is the position of the monster at index i in the monsters list, health is the health of the monster at index i in the monsters list, distance is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index i, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index i, bullets_needed is the health of the monster at index i, total_bullets_used is unchanged, t is unchanged. If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is greater than time_available, then success is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
