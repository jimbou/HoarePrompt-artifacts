Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, `i` is 2, `position` is the position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the second monster, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False. Otherwise, `success` is not updated.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total_bullets_used` has been increased by the value of `bullets_needed`, which is equal to the health of the second monster. The other variables remain unchanged. The program still has multiple test cases minus 4 inputs in the stdin, and the values of `n`, `k`, `healths`, `positions`, and `monsters` are still the same. The values of `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` are also unchanged. However, the value of `total_bullets_used` has been updated, and the value of `success` may have been updated to False if the total bullets used exceeds the time available.
