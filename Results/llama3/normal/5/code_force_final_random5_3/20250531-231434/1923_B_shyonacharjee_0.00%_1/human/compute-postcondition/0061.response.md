Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `i` is 2, `position` is the position of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index `i`, `t` is unchanged, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `total_bullets_used` has been increased by the value of `bullets_needed`, which is the health of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list. The value of `success` is now False, indicating that the total bullets used exceeded the time available. All other variables remain unchanged.
