The code prints 'YES' if the success condition is met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The success condition is met if the total bullets used plus the bullets needed to kill the last monster is less than or equal to the time available. 

Output: **YES if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is less than or equal to time_available, otherwise NO**
