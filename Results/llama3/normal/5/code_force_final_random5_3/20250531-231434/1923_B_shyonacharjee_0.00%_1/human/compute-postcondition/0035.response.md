Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, `i` is 1, `position` is the position of the second monster, `health` is the health of the second monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the second monster, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`.**

In this output state, the value of `total_bullets_used` has been updated by adding `bullets_needed` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The program continues execution if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is not greater than `time_available`, otherwise, `success` is set to False.
