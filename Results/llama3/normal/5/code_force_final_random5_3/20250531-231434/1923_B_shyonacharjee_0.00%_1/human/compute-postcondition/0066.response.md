Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to kill all monsters in a game scenario. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the number of monsters and a limit, the health of each monster, and the position of each monster. The function then simulates the game, sorting the monsters by their distance from the player and attempting to kill them in that order. It keeps track of the total bullets used and checks if it is possible to kill each monster with the available bullets. If it is possible to kill all monsters, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
