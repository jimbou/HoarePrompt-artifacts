Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin is empty, i is 0, position is the position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, bullets_needed is the health of the last monster, total_bullets_used is 0, success is True, t is decreased by 1. The current value of (total_bullets_used + bullets_needed) is greater than the current value of time_available.**
