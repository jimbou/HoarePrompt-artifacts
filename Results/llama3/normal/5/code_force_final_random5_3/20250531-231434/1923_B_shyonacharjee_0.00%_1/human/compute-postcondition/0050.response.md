Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin is empty, i is 0, position is the position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, bullets_needed is the health of the last monster, total_bullets_used is 0, t is decreased by 1. If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is greater than time_available, then success is False. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
