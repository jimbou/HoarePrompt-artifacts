Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, i is 2, position is the position of the monster at index i in the monsters list, health is the health of the monster at index i in the monsters list, distance is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index i, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index i, bullets_needed is the health of the monster at index i, total_bullets_used is increased by bullets_needed, t is unchanged. If total_bullets_used is greater than time_available, then success is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
