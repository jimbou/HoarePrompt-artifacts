Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game scenario by sorting the monsters by their distance from the player and attempting to kill them in that order. It keeps track of the total bullets used and checks if it is possible to kill each monster with the available bullets. The program also handles the case where a monster's position is negative, which means it is to the left of the player, by taking the absolute value of the position when calculating the distance.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly determines whether it is possible to kill all monsters in the game scenario. The use of the `sorted` function with a custom key function to sort the monsters by their distance from the player is efficient and effective. The program also uses a simple and efficient loop to simulate the game and check if it is possible to kill all monsters.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
