Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is `n`, `position` is an integer equal to the position of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `health` is an integer equal to the health of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `distance` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `bullets_needed` is a positive integer equal to the health of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `time_available` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` for any iteration of the loop, otherwise `success` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, and 'YES' is printed if `success` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed**
