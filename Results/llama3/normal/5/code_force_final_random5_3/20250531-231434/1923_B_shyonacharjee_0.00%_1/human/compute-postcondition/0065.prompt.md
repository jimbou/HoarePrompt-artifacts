Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n, x_i != 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
    positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
    total_bullets_used = 0
    success = True
    for i in range(n):
        position, health = monsters[i]
        distance = abs(position)
        time_available = distance
        bullets_needed = health
        if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
            success = False
            break
        total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
    print('YES' if success else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is `n`, `position` is an integer equal to the position of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `health` is an integer equal to the health of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `distance` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `bullets_needed` is a positive integer equal to the health of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `time_available` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i-1` (or undefined if `n` is 0), `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` for any iteration of the loop, otherwise `success` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, and 'YES' is printed if `success` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed` for each monster, `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` for any monster, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin is empty, i is n-1, position is the position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, bullets_needed is the health of the last monster, total_bullets_used is the sum of the health of all monsters, success is True if total_bullets_used is less than or equal to the absolute value of the position of the last monster, otherwise False, t is decreased by n, and 'YES' is printed if success is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
