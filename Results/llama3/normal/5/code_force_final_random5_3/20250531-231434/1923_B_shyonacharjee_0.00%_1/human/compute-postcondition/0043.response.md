Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed` for each monster, `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` for any monster, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `success` is True or False**
