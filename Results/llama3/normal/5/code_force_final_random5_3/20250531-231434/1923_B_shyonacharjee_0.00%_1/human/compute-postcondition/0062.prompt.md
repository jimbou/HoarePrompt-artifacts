Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin is empty, i is n-1, position is the position of the last monster, health is the health of the last monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, bullets_needed is the health of the last monster, total_bullets_used is 0, success is True, t is decreased by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `i` is 0, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, `t` is decreased by 1. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `i` is 1, `position` is the position of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index `i`, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `t` is unchanged. If `total_bullets_used` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `i` is 2, `position` is the position of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index `i` in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the monster at index `i`, `t` is unchanged, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
