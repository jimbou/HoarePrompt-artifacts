Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `i` is 2, `position` is an integer equal to the position of the monster at index `i`, `health` is an integer equal to the health of the monster at index `i`, `distance` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `bullets_needed` is a positive integer equal to the health of the monster at index `i`, `time_available` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute value of the position of the monster at index `i`, `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, otherwise `success` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `total_bullets_used` has been increased by `bullets_needed`, which is equal to the health of the monster at index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `success` is still dependent on the comparison between `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` and `time_available`.
