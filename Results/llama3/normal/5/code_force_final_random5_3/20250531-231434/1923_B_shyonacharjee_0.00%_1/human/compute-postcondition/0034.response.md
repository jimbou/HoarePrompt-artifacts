Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, healths is a list of integers, positions is a list of integers, monsters is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 2 integers and 2 lists of integers, i is 1, position is the position of the second monster, health is the health of the second monster, distance is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, time_available is the absolute value of the position of the second monster, bullets_needed is the health of the second monster, total_bullets_used is increased by bullets_needed, success is False if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is greater than time_available. If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed is not greater than time_available, the program continues execution. Otherwise, success is set to False.***
