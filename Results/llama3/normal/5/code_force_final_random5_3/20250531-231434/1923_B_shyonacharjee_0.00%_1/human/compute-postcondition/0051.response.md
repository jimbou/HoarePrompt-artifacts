Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples containing integers, `i` is 0, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, `t` is decreased by 1. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total_bullets_used` has been increased by the value of `bullets_needed`, which is equal to the health of the last monster. All other variables remain unchanged. If the new value of `total_bullets_used` plus the value of `bullets_needed` exceeds the value of `time_available`, then the program's state is set to failure (`success` is False). Otherwise, the program's state remains unchanged.
