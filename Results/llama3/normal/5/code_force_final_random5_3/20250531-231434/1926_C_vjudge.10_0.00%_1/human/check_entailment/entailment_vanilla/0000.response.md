Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.
2. The given program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the digits of a number `n` by converting it to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing them up.
3. The program then reads the number of test cases `N` and iterates over each test case.
4. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and initializes a variable `soma` to 0.
5. The program then iterates from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) and for each iteration, it calls the `func_1(i)` function to calculate the sum of the digits of the current number `i`. The result is added to the `soma` variable.
6. After iterating over all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, the program prints the final value of `soma`, which is the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The loop should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive), not from 0 to `n-1`. This is because the problem statement specifies that Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to `n`, inclusive, on the board.

Correctness: **False**
