Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it is not following the problem description. The problem states that Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n, inclusive, on the board, but the program is iterating from 0 to n-1 (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value). This means that the program is missing the number n in its calculation.

For example, if n=12, the program will only calculate the sum of the digits for numbers 0 to 11, but it should also include the number 12. This will result in an incorrect sum.

To fix this, the program should iterate from 1 to n, inclusive, or it should add 1 to the range function to include the number n in the calculation.
