Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to `n`.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The outer loop iterates `N` times, where `N` is the number of test cases. But inside the loop, the program calculates the sum of the digits for all integers from 1 to `n` and adds it to the total sum `soma`. This means that the program is calculating the sum of the digits for all integers from 1 to `n` for each test case, instead of calculating the sum of the digits for each integer from 1 to `n` separately.

For example, if the input is `n = 12`, the program will calculate the sum of the digits for all integers from 1 to 12, which is correct. But if the input is `n = 1`, the program will still calculate the sum of the digits for all integers from 1 to 1, which is also correct. However, if the input is `n = 2`, the program will calculate the sum of the digits for all integers from 1 to 2, which is incorrect because it should only calculate the sum of the digits for the integer 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
