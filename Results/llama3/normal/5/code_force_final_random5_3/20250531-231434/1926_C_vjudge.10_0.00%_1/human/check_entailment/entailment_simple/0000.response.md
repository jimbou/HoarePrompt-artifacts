Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it iterates over the range from 0 to n (inclusive). For each number in this range, it calls the function func_1, which calculates the sum of the digits of the number.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function func_1 is called with the argument i, which ranges from 0 to n-1. But the problem statement requires the sum of the digits of the numbers from 1 to n, inclusive. Therefore, the function func_1 should be called with the argument i+1 instead of i.

Additionally, the variable soma is used to accumulate the sum of the digits of all numbers across all test cases. However, the problem statement requires the sum of the digits of the numbers for each test case separately. Therefore, the variable soma should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case.

Correctness: **False**
