Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, if the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the j-th bit position, the j-th list contains two 0s except the j-th list which contains one 0 and one 1, otherwise the j-th list contains one 1 and one 0 except the j-th list which now contains one 1 and one 1, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is `n-1`, `cur` is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-2)-th index in arr, `j` is 32, 32 is greater than 0, and `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1 if the j-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the `suf` list has been updated according to the bits of the `cur` variable. Specifically, for each bit position `j` in `cur`, if the bit is 1, the corresponding list in `suf` has been updated to contain one 0 and one 1, otherwise it contains one 1 and one 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
