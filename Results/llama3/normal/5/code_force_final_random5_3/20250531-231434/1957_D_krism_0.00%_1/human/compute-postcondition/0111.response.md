Postcondition: ***arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 2, j is at least 2 and less than 32, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr. If the j-th bit of c is 1, then pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 3, and suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -3. Otherwise, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 33 and one 2, and suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 31 and one -2. stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 1, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix.***
