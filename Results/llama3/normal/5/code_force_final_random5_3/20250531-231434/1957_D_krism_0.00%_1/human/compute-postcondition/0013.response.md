To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` and the range `32`. Since the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `32`, we can adjust the state of `i` to be `0` (the starting value of the range) and ensure that `32` is a positive integer.

State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two 0s, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two 0s, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is 0, 32 is a positive integer**
