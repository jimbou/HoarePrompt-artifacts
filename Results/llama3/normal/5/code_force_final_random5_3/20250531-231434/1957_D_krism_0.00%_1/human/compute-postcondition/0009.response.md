Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in `arr`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, arr is an empty list**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `prefix` list will contain `n+1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the XOR of all integers from index `0` to `i-1` in the `arr` list. The `stdin` will still contain `t-1` test cases, and `n` will remain the same. The `arr` list will be empty because all its elements have been processed by the loop.
