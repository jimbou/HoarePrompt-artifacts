Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 2, j is 32, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr, pre and suf are lists of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 1, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 2, j is at least 0 and less than 32, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 1 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 33 and one 0, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -1 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 31 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 1, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 2, j is at least 1 and less than 32, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 2 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 33 and one 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -2 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 31 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 1, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix. If the j-th bit of c is 1, then the second element of each list in pre is 2 and the second element of each list in suf is -2. Otherwise, the second element of each list in pre is 1 and the second element of each list in suf is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 2, j is at least 2 and less than 32, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr. If the j-th bit of c is 1, then pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 3, and suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -3. Otherwise, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 33 and one 2, and suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 31 and one -2. stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 1, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
