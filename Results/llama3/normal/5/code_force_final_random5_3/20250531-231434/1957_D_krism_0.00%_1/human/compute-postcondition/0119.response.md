Output State: **arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 3, j is 1, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 33 and one 32 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 33 and one 31, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 31 and one -32 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 30 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 2, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix, and the j-th bit of c is 1.**

The code modifies the values of `pre` and `suf` by incrementing the first element of `pre[j]` by 1 and decrementing the first element of `suf[j]` by 1. Since `j` is 0 and the j-th bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j]` becomes [33, 32] and `suf[j]` becomes [31, 0]. The value of `j` is also incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
