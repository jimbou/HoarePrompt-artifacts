According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range `32`. If `32` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0 and `32` must be greater than 0.
State: **arr has an additional element y at index i-1, prefix has an additional element c at index i, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 1, j is 0, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, pre and suf are lists of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0**
