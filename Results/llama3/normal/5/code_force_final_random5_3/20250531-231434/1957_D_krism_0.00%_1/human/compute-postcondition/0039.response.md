The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is at least 0 and less than 32, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 32, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is at least 0 and less than 32.

State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, if the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the j-th bit position, the j-th list contains two 0s except the j-th list which contains one 0 and one 1, otherwise the j-th list contains one 1 and one 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is `n-1`, `cur` is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-2)-th index in arr, `j` is at least 0 and less than 32, 32 is greater than 0**
