Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, if the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the j-th bit position, the j-th list contains two 0s except the j-th list which contains one 0 and one 1, otherwise the j-th list contains one 1 and one 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, `j` is 32, 32 is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `prefix` list remains unchanged, containing the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in `arr`. The `stdin` still contains t-1 test cases, and `n` is still greater than 0. The `arr` list remains empty, and the `pre` list still contains 32 lists, each with one 32 and one 0. The `suf` list has been updated such that if the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the j-th bit position, the j-th list contains two 0s except the j-th list which contains one 0 and one 1, otherwise the j-th list contains one 1 and one 0. The `i` variable is still `n`, and `cur` is still the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in `arr`. The `j` variable has reached 32, indicating that the loop has completed all 32 iterations.
