Postcondition: ***arr has an additional element y at index i-1, prefix has an additional element c at index i, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 1, j is 0, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, pre and suf are lists of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0. If the j-th bit of c is 1, then pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 1, and suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -1. If the j-th bit of c is 0, then pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 33 and one 0, and suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 31 and one 0.***
