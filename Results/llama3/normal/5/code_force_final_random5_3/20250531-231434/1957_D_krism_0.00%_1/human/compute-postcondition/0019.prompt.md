Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: prefix is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, arr is an empty list, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two 0s, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two 0s, and this is printed: an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr
Code of the loop:
for i in range(32):
    pre[i][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 1 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two 0s, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is 0, 32 is a positive integer

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 2 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two 0s, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is 1, 32 is a positive integer

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 3 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two 0s, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is 2, 32 is a positive integer




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
