Postcondition: **The program executes an if-else block based on the condition `c >> j & 1`. If the condition is true, the program updates the lists `pre` and `suf` by changing the second element of each list to 1 and -1 respectively. If the condition is false, the program updates the lists `pre` and `suf` by changing the first element of each list to 33 and 31 respectively. In both cases, the program prints an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr. The program also increments `ans` by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in `pre` and `suf` at index `k`, and updates `i` and `j` to 1. The program then prints the updated values of `arr`, `prefix`, `ans`, `pre`, `suf`, `cur`, and `stdin`.**
