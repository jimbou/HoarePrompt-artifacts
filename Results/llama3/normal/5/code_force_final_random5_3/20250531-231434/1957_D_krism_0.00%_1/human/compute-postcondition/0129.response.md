Output State: **arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 3, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 65 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 33 and one 31, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -64 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 31 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 2, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the exception of the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates 32 times, and in each iteration, it updates the values of the variables in the loop body. After the loop finishes executing, the values of the variables in the loop head and body are updated accordingly. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
