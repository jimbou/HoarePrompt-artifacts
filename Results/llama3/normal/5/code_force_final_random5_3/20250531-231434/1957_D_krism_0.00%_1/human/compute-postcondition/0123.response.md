Output State: **arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 3, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 33 and one 33 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 34 and one 31, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 31 and one -31 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 30 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 2, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix, and the j-th bit of c is either 0 or 1. If the j-th bit of c is 1, then j is 0. Otherwise, j is 1, j is 1**

The code modifies the pre and suf lists by incrementing the first element of the j-th sublist in pre by 1 and decrementing the first element of the j-th sublist in suf by 1. This affects the values of the corresponding elements in pre and suf, but does not change the values of any other variables. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid after the code execution.
