Output State: `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, if the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the j-th bit position, the j-th list contains two 0s except the j-th list which contains one 0 and one 1, otherwise the j-th list contains one 1 and one 0 except the j-th list which now contains one 1 and one 1, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, `j` is 32, 32 is greater than 0, and `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1 if the j-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, except that `i` is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `suf[j][1]` and `suf[j][0]` have been updated based on the bits of `cur` for all iterations of the loop.
