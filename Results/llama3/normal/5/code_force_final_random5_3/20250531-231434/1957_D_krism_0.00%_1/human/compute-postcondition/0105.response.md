Output State: **arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 2, j is at least 1 and less than 32, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 2 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 33 and one 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -2 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 31 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 1, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix**

In this output state, the values of `pre` and `suf` have been modified. Specifically, the second element of the `j-th` list in `pre` has been incremented by 1, and the second element of the `j-th` list in `suf` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
