The only objects in the loop head are variables  v and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 integer, v is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the v is the second integer in the list.
State: **`prefix` is a list containing two elements 0 and v ^ 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, v is the second integer in the list**
