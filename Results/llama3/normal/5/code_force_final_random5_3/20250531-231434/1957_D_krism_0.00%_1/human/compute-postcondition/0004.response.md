Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing two elements 0 and v ^ 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, arr is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, v is the first integer in the list**

The code appends a new element to the `prefix` list, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the first integer `v` and the last element of the `prefix` list (which is 0). This results in the `prefix` list now containing two elements: 0 and `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
