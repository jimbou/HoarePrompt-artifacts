Output: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in `arr`, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, arr is an empty list, and this is printed: an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in `arr`**
