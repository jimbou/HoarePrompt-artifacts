Output State: **arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 2, j is at least 2 and less than 32, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 33 and one 2 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 33 and one 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 31 and one -2 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 31 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 1, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix. If the j-th bit of c is 1, then the second element of each list in pre is 2 and the second element of each list in suf is -2. Otherwise, the second element of each list in pre is 1 and the second element of each list in suf is -1.**

The code modifies the values of pre and suf. The first line increments the first element of the j-th list in pre by 1, and the second line decrements the first element of the j-th list in suf by 1. As a result, the first element of each list in pre becomes 33, and the first element of each list in suf becomes 31. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
