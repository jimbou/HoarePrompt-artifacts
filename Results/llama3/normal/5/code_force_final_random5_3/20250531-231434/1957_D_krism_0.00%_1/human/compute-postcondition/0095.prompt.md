Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr has an additional element y at index i-1, prefix has an additional element c at index i, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 1, j is 0, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, pre and suf are lists of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *arr has an additional element y at index i-1, prefix has an additional element c at index i, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 1, j is 0, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, pre and suf are lists of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0. If the j-th bit of c is 1, then pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 1, and suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -1. If the j-th bit of c is 0, then pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 33 and one 0, and suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 31 and one 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program executes an if-else block based on the condition `c >> j & 1`. If the condition is true, the program updates the lists `pre` and `suf` by changing the second element of each list to 1 and -1 respectively. If the condition is false, the program updates the lists `pre` and `suf` by changing the first element of each list to 33 and 31 respectively. In both cases, the program prints an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr. The program also increments `ans` by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in `pre` and `suf` at index `k`, and updates `i` and `j` to 1. The program then prints the updated values of `arr`, `prefix`, `ans`, `pre`, `suf`, `cur`, and `stdin`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr`, `prefix`, `ans`, `pre`, `suf`, `cur`, `stdin`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `c` are updated. If the bit at position `j` in `c` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
