Output State: **arr has an additional element y at index i-1, prefix has an additional element c at index i, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 1, j is 0, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, and the j-th bit of c is 1.**

The code modifies the values of `pre` and `suf` by incrementing the second element of `pre[j]` by 1 and decrementing the second element of `suf[j]` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
