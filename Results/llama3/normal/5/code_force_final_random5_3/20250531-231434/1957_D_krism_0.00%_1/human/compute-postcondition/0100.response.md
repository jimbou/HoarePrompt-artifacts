Output State: **arr has an additional element y at index i, prefix has an additional element c at index i+1, ans is increased by the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k, i is 2, j is at least 0 and less than 32, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 1, an empty list and a list containing n+2 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix. The current value of c has a bit set at position j (i.e., c >> j & 1 is True).**

Explanation: The code modifies the values of `pre` and `suf` at index `j`. Specifically, it increments the second element of `pre[j]` by 1 and decrements the second element of `suf[j]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
