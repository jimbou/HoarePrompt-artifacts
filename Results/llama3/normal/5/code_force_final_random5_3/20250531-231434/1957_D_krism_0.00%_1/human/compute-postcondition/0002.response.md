Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing a single element 0**

In this output state, the first line of the code reads an integer t from stdin, which represents the number of test cases. The second line reads a list of n integers from stdin, where n is the number of integers in the current test case. The third line initializes a list called prefix with a single element 0. 

Note that the value of t is reduced by 1 because one test case has been processed. The value of n is updated to the number of integers in the next test case. The list arr contains the n integers read from stdin, and the list prefix contains a single element 0.
