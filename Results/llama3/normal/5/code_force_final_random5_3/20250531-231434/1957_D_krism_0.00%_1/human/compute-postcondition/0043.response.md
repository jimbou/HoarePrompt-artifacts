Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, if the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the j-th bit position, the j-th list contains two 0s except the j-th list which contains one 0 and one 1, otherwise the j-th list contains one 1 and one 0 except the j-th list which now contains one 1 and one 1, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is `n-1`, `cur` is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-2)-th index in arr, `j` is at least 0 and less than 32, 32 is greater than 0, and the j-th bit of `cur` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `suf[j][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in the j-th list of `suf` now containing one 1 and one 1, since the j-th bit of `cur` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
