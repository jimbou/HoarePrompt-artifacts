This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It first reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads an integer n, representing the number of integers in the test case, and n integers. It calculates the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in the array and stores it in the prefix array. It then initializes two lists, pre and suf, to keep track of the count of 1s and 0s in the corresponding bit position of the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in the array. It iterates over the array from the last element to the first, updating the pre and suf lists accordingly. Finally, it calculates the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k for all iterations, where k is the bit length of the current element minus 1, and prints the result.
