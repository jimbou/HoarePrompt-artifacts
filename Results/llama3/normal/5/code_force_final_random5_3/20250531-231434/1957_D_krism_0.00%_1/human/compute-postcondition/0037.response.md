To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, if the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the j-th bit position, the j-th list contains two 0s except the j-th list which contains one 0 and one 1, otherwise the j-th list contains one 1 and one 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is `n-1`, `cur` is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, `j` is 32, 32 is greater than 0**
