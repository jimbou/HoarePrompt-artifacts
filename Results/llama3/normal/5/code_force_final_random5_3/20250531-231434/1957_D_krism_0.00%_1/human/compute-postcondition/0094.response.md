Postcondition: ***`arr`, `prefix`, `ans`, `pre`, `suf`, `cur`, `stdin`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `c` are updated. If the bit at position `j` in `c` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.***
