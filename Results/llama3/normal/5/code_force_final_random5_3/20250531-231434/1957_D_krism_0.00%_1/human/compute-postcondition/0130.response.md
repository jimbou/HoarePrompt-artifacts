Output State: **arr has n elements, prefix has n+1 elements, ans is the sum of the products of corresponding elements in pre and suf at index k for all iterations, i is n, j is 32, cur is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 2^(n-1) if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 33 and one 2^(n-1)-1, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -2^(n-1)+1 if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise one 31 and one 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is greater than 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, 32 is greater than 0, y is the element at index i-1 in arr, k is the bit length of y minus 1, c is the element at index i in prefix.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the array `arr` will have `n` elements, and the `prefix` list will have `n+1` elements. The variable `ans` will be the sum of the products of corresponding elements in `pre` and `suf` at index `k` for all iterations. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n`, and the inner loop counter `j` will be equal to 32. The variable `cur` will be the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in `arr`. The `pre` list will be a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 2^(n-1) if the j-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise one 33 and one 2^(n-1)-1. The `suf` list will be a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one -2^(n-1)+1 if the j-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise one 31 and one 0. The other variables will remain unchanged.
