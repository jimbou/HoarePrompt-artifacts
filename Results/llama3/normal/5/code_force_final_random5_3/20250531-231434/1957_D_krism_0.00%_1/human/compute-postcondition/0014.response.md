Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer equal to the number of integers in the next test case, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 1 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two 0s, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is 0, 32 is a positive integer**

In this output state, the value of `pre[i][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `pre` being a list of 32 lists, each containing one 1 and one 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
