Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, if the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the j-th bit position, the j-th list contains two 0s except the j-th list which contains one 0 and one 1, otherwise the j-th list contains one 1 and one 0, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is `n`, `cur` is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, `j` is 1, 32 is greater than 0, and the second element of the second list in `suf` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the second element of the second list in `suf` has been incremented by 1.
