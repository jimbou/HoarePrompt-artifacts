Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, if the current value of `cur` has a 1 at the j-th bit position, the j-th list contains two 0s except the j-th list which contains one 0 and one 1, otherwise the j-th list contains one 1 and one 0 except the j-th list which now contains one 1 and one 1, an empty list and a list containing n+1 elements where the i-th element is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (i-1)-th index in arr are printed, `i` is 0, `cur` is the XOR of all integers from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th index in arr, `j` is 0, 32 is greater than 0. If the j-th bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1. The value of `suf[j][1]` or `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1 based on whether the j-th bit of `cur` is 1 or 0. The value of `suf[j][1]` or `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1 based on whether the j-th bit of `cur` is 1 or 0. The value of `suf[j][1]` or `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1 based on whether the j-th bit of `cur` is 1 or 0. and the list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0 is printed, and the list of 32 lists, each containing one 32 and one 0 is printed, `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
