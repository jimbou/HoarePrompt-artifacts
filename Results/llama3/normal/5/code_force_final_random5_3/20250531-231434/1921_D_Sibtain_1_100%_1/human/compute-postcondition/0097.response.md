Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, c is a list of integers in ascending order, ans is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of a and the 0th element of c and the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of a and the (len(c) - 1)th element of c, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, k is 1, if t2 is greater than t1 then i is 0 and j is 3, otherwise i is 1 and j is 2, stdin is empty.***
