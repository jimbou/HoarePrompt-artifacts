Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is either `t1` or `t2`, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The lists `a` and `c` are still sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively, and `n`, `m`, `i`, `ans`, and `k` retain their original values. The expressions for `t1` and `t2` are also unchanged, but the value of `j` used in `t2` has been updated.
