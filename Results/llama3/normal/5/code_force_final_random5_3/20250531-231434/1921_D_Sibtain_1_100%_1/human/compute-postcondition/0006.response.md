Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers. If all elements in a are the same, all elements in c are the same, and the first element of a is equal to the first element of c, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the state of n, m, a, and c remains unchanged.***
