Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, and `ans` is either `t1 + max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + max(t1, t2)`. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, and `ans` is either `t1 + max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + max(t1, t2)`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is now either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `j` is now either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
