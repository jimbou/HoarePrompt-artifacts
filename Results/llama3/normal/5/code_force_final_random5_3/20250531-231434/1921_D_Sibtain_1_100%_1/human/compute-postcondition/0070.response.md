Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 0 or the length of `a`, `j` is either 1 or the length of `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as integers, the lists `a` and `c` remain sorted and in descending order respectively, the variable `i` is either 0 or the length of `a`, the variable `j` is either 1 or the length of `c`, the variable `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, the variable `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, the variable `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, the variable `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, and the standard input is empty.
