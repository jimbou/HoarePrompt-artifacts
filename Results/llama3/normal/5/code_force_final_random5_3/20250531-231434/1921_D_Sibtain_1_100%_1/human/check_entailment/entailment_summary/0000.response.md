Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the elements of the second array (c_i) in a way that maximizes the sum of absolute differences with the elements of the first array (a_i).

The program first checks for the edge cases where all elements in both arrays are the same (in which case the maximum difference is 0) or where one of the arrays has only one element (in which case the maximum difference is the absolute difference between that element and the closest element in the other array).

For the general case, the program sorts both arrays and then iterates through them, keeping track of the maximum absolute differences between the elements at the start and end of the arrays. This is done by maintaining two pointers, i and j, which start at the beginning and end of the arrays, respectively. At each step, the program calculates the absolute differences between the elements at the current positions of i and j, and updates the maximum difference accordingly.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of absolute differences between the elements of the two arrays.

Correctness: **True**
