Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, stdin is empty. If the length of `a` is 1, the program prints the maximum absolute difference between the only element of `a` and the maximum and minimum elements of `c`, and skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `j`, and `ans` have been reset to 0, 1, and 0, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k` remain unchanged. The program's behavior regarding the length of `a` and the printing of the maximum absolute difference also remains the same.
