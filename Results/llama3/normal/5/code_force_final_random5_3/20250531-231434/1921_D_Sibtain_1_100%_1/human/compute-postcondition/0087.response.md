Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, c is a list of integers in ascending order, i is 0, j is 1, ans is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the 0th element of a and the 0th element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of a and the (len(c) - 1)th element of c, k is 0, stdin is empty. The current value of t2 is greater than the current value of t1.**
