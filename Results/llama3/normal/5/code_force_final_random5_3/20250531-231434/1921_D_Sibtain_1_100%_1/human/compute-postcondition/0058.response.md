Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is either 0 or 1, j is either 1 or 2, ans is the maximum of t1 and t2, t1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and c, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second last element of c, k is 1, and stdin is empty. If t2 is greater than t1, then j is 2. Otherwise, i is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `t1` and `t2` based on the elements of lists `a` and `c`, and the values of `i` and `j`. The first line calculates the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of `a` and the `i`-th element of `c`, and assigns it to `t1`. The second line calculates the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)`-th element of `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`-th element of `c`, and assigns it to `t2`. 

The values of `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, and either 1 or 2, respectively. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged. Stdin is empty.
