#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        a.sort()
        
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        
        i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
        
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
            if t2 > t1:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1

    #State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` from the start and end of the lists, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `j` is the length of `c`, stdin is empty, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` from the start and end of the lists which is `ans` is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a_i and b_i from the start and end of the lists, and prints this sum for each test case. If all elements in both lists are the same, it prints 0. If one of the lists has only one element, it prints the maximum absolute difference between that element and the closest element in the other list. Otherwise, it sorts both lists and iterates through them, keeping track of the maximum absolute differences between the elements at the start and end of the lists, and prints the sum of these differences.
