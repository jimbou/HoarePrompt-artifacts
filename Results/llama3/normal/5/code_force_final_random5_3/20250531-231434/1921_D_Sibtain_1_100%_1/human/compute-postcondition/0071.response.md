Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`.
* Since `a` is a sorted list of integers and `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the maximum absolute differences will occur between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `c`, and between the largest element of `a` and the smallest element of `c`.
* `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`. Since `i` is either 0 or the length of `a`, `t1` will be the absolute difference between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `c` (when `i` is 0) or the absolute difference between the largest element of `a` and the smallest element of `c` (when `i` is the length of `a`).
* `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`. Since `j` is either 1 or the length of `c`, `t2` will be the absolute difference between the largest element of `a` and the smallest element of `c` (when `j` is 1) or the absolute difference between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `c` (when `j` is the length of `c`).
* `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, which means it is the index of the last element of `a`.

Considering these values, the output of the print statement will be the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, which is the sum of `t1` and `t2`.

Output: **the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c**
