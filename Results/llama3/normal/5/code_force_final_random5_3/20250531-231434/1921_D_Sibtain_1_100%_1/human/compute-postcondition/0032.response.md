Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, k is 2, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c. If t2 > t1, then i is either 0 or 1 and j is either 3 or 4, or i is either 1 or 2 and j is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, i is either 1 or 2 and j is either 2 or 3, or i is either 2 or 3 and j is either 1 or 2. In all cases, ans is either t1 + max(t1, t2) or t2 + max(t1, t2).***
