To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, we can adjust its state to have at least one element. The state of `k` can be adjusted to be 0, which is the starting index of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0**
