Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
        print(0)
        continue
    a.sort()
    c.sort(reverse=True)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
        continue
    i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
    for k in range(len(a)):
        t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
        t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
        if t2 > t1:
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        ans += max(t1, t2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(c)`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at each iteration of the loop, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at each iteration of the loop which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 0 or the length of `a`, `j` is either 1 or the length of `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, and stdin is empty, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` from the start and end of the lists, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `j` is the length of `c`, stdin is empty, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` from the start and end of the lists which is `ans` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
