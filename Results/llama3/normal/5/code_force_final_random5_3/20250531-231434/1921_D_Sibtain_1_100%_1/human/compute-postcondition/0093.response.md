To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for k in range(len(a)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than the length of list `a`. Since `a` must have at least 1 element, the length of `a` is at least 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1.

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `k`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c` and the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, `k` is 1, `i` is 0 if `t2` is greater than `t1` and 1 otherwise, `j` is 2 if `t2` is greater than `t1` and 1 otherwise, stdin is empty.**
