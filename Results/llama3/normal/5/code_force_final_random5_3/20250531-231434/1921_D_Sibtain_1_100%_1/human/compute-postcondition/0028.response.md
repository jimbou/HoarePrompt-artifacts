The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the length of the list `a`. If `k` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `a` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least two elements.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, and `ans` is either `t1 + max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + max(t1, t2)`. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either `t1 + max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + max(t1, t2)`**
