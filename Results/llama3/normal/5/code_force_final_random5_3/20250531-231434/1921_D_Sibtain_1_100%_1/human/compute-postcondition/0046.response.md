Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is undefined, `j` is undefined, `ans` is undefined, stdin is empty, and the maximum absolute difference between the first element of the list `a` and the maximum and minimum elements of the list `c` is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, and the stdin is still empty. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The maximum absolute difference between the first element of the list `a` and the maximum and minimum elements of the list `c` is still being printed.
