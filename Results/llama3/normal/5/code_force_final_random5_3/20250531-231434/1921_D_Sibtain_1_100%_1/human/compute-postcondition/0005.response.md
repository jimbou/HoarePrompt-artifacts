Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with all elements being the same, `c` is a list of integers with all elements being the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop that this continue statement is directly inside.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`) retain their initial values and properties, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop that the `continue` statement is directly inside.
