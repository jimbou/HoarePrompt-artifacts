Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, stdin is empty. If the length of `a` is 1, the program prints the maximum absolute difference between the only element of `a` and the maximum and minimum elements of `c`, and skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c` and the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0 if `t2` is greater than `t1` and 1 otherwise, `j` is 2 if `t2` is greater than `t1` and 1 otherwise, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, and the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `k` is 1, if `t2` is greater than `t1` then `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - 1)`th element of `a` and the `(len(c) - 1)`th element of `c`, and the maximum of `t1` and `t2` plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i`th element of `a` and the `i`th element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)`th element of `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`th element of `c`, `k` is 2, if `t2` is greater than `t1` then `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
