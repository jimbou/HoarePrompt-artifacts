Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly handles the edge cases where all elements in both lists are the same, or where one of the lists has only one element. It also correctly sorts both lists and iterates through them to find the maximum absolute differences between the elements at the start and end of the lists. The program's logic is sound and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
