Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of integers, `i` is undefined, `j` is undefined, `ans` is undefined, stdin is empty, and 0 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state because the `continue` statement does not modify any variables. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.
