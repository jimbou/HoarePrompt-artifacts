This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a_i and b_i from the start and end of the lists, and prints this sum for each test case. If all elements in both lists are the same, it prints 0. If one of the lists has only one element, it prints the maximum absolute difference between that element and the closest element in the other list. Otherwise, it sorts both lists and iterates through them, keeping track of the maximum absolute differences between the elements at the start and end of the lists, and prints the sum of these differences.
