Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers in ascending order, c is a list of integers in ascending order, i is either 0 or the length of a, j is either 1 or the length of c, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, k is the length of a minus 1, stdin is empty.**

The code sorts list `a` in ascending order and list `c` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as it is empty.
