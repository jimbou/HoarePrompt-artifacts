Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with exactly one element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order. If all elements in a are the same, all elements in c are the same, and the first element of a is equal to the first element of c, then the state of n, m, a, and c remains unchanged. The current value of a has only one element.**
