Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin is empty. If the length of `a` is 1, the maximum absolute difference between the first element of the list `a` and the maximum and minimum elements of the list `c` is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the second last element of `c`, `k` is 0, and stdin is empty. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2` plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the second last element of `c`, `k` is 1, and stdin is empty. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 1, 2, or 3, `j` is either 2, 3, or 4, `ans` is 2 times the maximum of t1 and t2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `k` is 2, and stdin is empty. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
