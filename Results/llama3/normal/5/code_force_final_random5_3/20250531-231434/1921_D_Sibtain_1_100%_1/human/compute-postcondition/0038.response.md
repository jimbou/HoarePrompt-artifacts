Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, i is undefined, j is undefined, ans is undefined, stdin is empty**

The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The third line reads another list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `c`. Since `a` and `c` are assigned new values, their previous properties (sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively) are lost. The variables `i` and `j` are no longer defined since their values were based on the lengths of the original lists `a` and `c`, which have been replaced. The variable `ans` is also undefined since it was calculated based on the original lists `a` and `c`. Stdin is now empty since all inputs have been read.
