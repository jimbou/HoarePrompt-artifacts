Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first checks if all elements in both arrays are the same. If so, it prints 0, which is correct because the total difference would be 0.

2. It then sorts the array a_i in ascending order and the array c_i in descending order. This is correct because we want to maximize the difference between corresponding elements in the two arrays.

3. If the length of array a_i is 1, it prints the maximum absolute difference between the single element in a_i and the maximum or minimum element in c_i. This is correct because we can only choose one element from c_i to maximize the difference.

4. If the length of array a_i is more than 1, it uses a two-pointer technique to iterate through the sorted arrays. It maintains two pointers, i and j, starting from the beginning and end of the arrays, respectively. At each step, it calculates the absolute difference between the current elements at the i-th and j-th positions in the two arrays. It then moves the pointer that results in the larger difference. This is correct because we want to maximize the total difference by choosing the largest possible differences at each step.

5. Finally, it prints the total difference, which is the sum of the maximum differences at each step.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when all elements in both arrays are the same, when the length of array a_i is 1, and when the length of array a_i is more than 1. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
