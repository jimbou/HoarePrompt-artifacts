Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 2 or 3, `j` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2` plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i`th element of `a` and the `i`th element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)`th element of `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`th element of `c`, `k` is 2, and stdin is empty. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition "If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2" is still valid, so the value of `j` depends on the values of `t1` and `t2`.
