Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, and the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i`th element of `a` and the `i`th element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - `j`)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - `j`)th element of `c`, `k` is 2, if `t2` is greater than `t1` then `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, and 2 otherwise. The values of the other variables remain the same.
