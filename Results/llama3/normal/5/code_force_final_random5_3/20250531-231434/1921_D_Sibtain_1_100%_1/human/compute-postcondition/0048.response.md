Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, stdin is empty. If the length of `a` is 1, the maximum absolute difference between the first element of the list `a` and the maximum and minimum elements of the list `c` is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` have been assigned the values 0, 1, and 0, respectively. The stdin remains empty as no input operation was performed. The condition regarding the length of `a` and the printing of the maximum absolute difference still holds, and if true, the loop will be skipped.
