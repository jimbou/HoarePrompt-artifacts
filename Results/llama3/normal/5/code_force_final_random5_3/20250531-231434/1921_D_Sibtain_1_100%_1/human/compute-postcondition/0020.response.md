Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is either 0 or 1, j is either 1 or 2, ans is 0, k is 0, the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c (t1) and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c (t2) have been calculated, and either t2 is greater than t1 or t1 is greater than or equal to t2.**
