The code prints the maximum absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the maximum element of list `c`, or the first element of list `a` and the minimum element of list `c`.

Since `a` is a list of integers in ascending order, the first element of `a` is the smallest element in `a`. Similarly, since `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, the maximum element of `c` is the largest element in `c` and the minimum element of `c` is the smallest element in `c`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the maximum absolute difference between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `c`, or the smallest element of `a` and the smallest element of `c`.

Output: **max(abs(smallest element of a - largest element of c), abs(smallest element of a - smallest element of c))**
