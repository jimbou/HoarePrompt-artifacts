Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with exactly one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order. If all elements in `a` are the same, all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the state of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remains unchanged. The current value of `a` has only one element, and the maximum absolute difference between the only element in `a` and the maximum or minimum element in `c` is being printed.**

The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`. The condition that if all elements in `a` are the same, all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the state of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remains unchanged, is still valid. The maximum absolute difference between the only element in `a` and the maximum or minimum element in `c` is still being printed.
