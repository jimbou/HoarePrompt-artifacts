Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(c)`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at each iteration of the loop, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at each iteration of the loop which is ans is being printed**
