Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, and the maximum of t1 and t2, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `k` is 2, if t2 is greater than t1 then `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, otherwise `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `i` was either 0 or 1, depending on the comparison between `t1` and `t2`, and now it is either 1 or 2, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
