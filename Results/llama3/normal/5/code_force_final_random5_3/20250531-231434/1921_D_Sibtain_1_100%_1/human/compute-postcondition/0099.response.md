State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, and the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `k` is 2, if `t2` is greater than `t1` then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, stdin is empty.**
