Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is either 1 or 2, j is either 2 or 3, ans is the maximum of t1 and t2 plus the maximum of t1 and t2, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, k is 2, and stdin is empty. If t2 is greater than t1, then j is 3. Otherwise, i is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k`, and stdin remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `i` and `j` are determined based on the comparison between `t1` and `t2`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 3; otherwise, `i` is 2. The values of `t1` and `t2` are calculated based on the absolute differences between specific elements of `a` and `c`. The value of `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2` plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.
