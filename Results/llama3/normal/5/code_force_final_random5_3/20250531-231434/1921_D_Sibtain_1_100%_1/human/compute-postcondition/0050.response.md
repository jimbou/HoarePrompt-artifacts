Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is 0, j is 1, ans is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and c, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second last element of c, k is 0, stdin is empty**

The code calculates the absolute differences between the first elements of lists `a` and `c` and assigns it to `t1`, and the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the second last element of `c` and assigns it to `t2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, and stdin remain unchanged.
