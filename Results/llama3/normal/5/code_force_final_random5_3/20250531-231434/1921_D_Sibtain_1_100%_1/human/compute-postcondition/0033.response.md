Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1 and `j` is either 3 or 4, or `i` is either 1 or 2 and `j` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2 and `j` is either 2 or 3, or `i` is either 2 or 3 and `j` is either 1 or 2. `ans` is either `t1 + 2*max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + 2*max(t1, t2)**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
