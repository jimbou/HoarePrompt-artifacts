Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is undefined, j is undefined, ans is undefined, stdin is empty. If the length of a is 1, the maximum absolute difference between the first element of the list a and the maximum and minimum elements of the list c is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
