Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0. If all elements in `a` are the same, all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the state of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remains unchanged. If `a` has only one element, the maximum absolute difference between the only element in `a` and the maximum or minimum element in `c` is not printed yet.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain the same as in the initial state. The code only introduces new variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` with initial values 0, 1, and 0, respectively. The conditions regarding the elements of `a` and `c` still apply, but no action is taken yet to print the maximum absolute difference.
