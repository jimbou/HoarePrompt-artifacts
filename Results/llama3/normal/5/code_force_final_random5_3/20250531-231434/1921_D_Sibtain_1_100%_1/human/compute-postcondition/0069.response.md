Output State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is equal to the length of `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `c`, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, and stdin is empty.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `i` and `j` have reached the end of the lists `a` and `c` respectively, and the variable `ans` has accumulated the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`. The variables `t1` and `t2` hold the absolute differences between the last elements of `a` and `c`, and the variable `k` is equal to the length of `a`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, and stdin remain unchanged.
