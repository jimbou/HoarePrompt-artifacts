Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is 0, j is 1, ans is 0, k is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces two new variables, `t1` and `t2`, which are assigned the absolute differences between specific elements of lists `a` and `c`. The specific values of `t1` and `t2` depend on the actual elements in `a` and `c`, but their definitions are now part of the output state.
