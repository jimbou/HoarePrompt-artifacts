Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0. If all elements in `a` are the same, all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the state of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remains unchanged. If `a` has only one element, the maximum absolute difference between the only element in `a` and the maximum or minimum element in `c` is not printed yet.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either `t1` or `t2`, `k` is 0, the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c` (t1) and the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c` (t2) have been calculated, and either `t2` is greater than `t1` or `t1` is greater than or equal to `t2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, and `ans` is either `t1 + max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + max(t1, t2)`. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either `t1 + max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + max(t1, t2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1 and `j` is either 3 or 4, or `i` is either 1 or 2 and `j` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2 and `j` is either 2 or 3, or `i` is either 2 or 3 and `j` is either 1 or 2. `ans` is either `t1 + 2*max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + 2*max(t1, t2)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
