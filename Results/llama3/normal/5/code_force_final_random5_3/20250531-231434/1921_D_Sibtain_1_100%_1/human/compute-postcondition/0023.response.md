Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is either 0 or 1, j is either 1 or 2, ans is either t1 or t2, k is 1, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c.**

The code calculates the absolute differences between specific elements of lists `a` and `c` and assigns these values to `t1` and `t2`, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only changes are the new values assigned to `t1` and `t2`, which are based on the elements of `a` and `c` at specific indices determined by `i` and `j`.
