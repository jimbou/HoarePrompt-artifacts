The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` was 1, so the new value of `j` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c` (t1) and the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c` (t2) have already been calculated, and the current value of t2 is greater than the current value of t1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is 0, j is 2, ans is 0, k is 0, the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c (t1) and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c (t2) have been calculated, and t2 is greater than t1.
