Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers in descending order, i is either 0 or the length of a, j is either 1 or the length of c, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, k is the length of a minus 1, stdin is empty. If all elements in both lists a and c are the same, the number 0 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the execution continues without printing 0.***
