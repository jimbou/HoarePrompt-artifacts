Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers in ascending order, c is a list of integers in ascending order, i is either 0 or the length of a, j is either 1 or the length of c, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, k is the length of a minus 1, stdin is empty, and this is printed: max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))), and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain the same, and the print statement remains the same. The only change is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
