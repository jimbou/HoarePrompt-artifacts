Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, c is a list of integers in ascending order, i is 0, j is 1, ans is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the 0th element of a and the 0th element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of a and the (len(c) - 1)th element of c, k is 0, stdin is empty**

The code snippet updates the values of `t1` and `t2` based on the elements of lists `a` and `c` at specific indices. The first line recalculates `t1` as the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`. The second line recalculates `t2` as the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The rest of the variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, and `k`) and the state of stdin remain unaffected by the code execution.
