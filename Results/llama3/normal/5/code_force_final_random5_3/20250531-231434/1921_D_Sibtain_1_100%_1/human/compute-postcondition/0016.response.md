Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is 0, j is 1, ans is 0, k is 0, the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of c (t1) and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of c (t2) have been calculated. The current value of t2 is greater than the current value of t1.**
