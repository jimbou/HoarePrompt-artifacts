Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is either 0 or 1, j is either 1 or 2, ans is 0, t1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and c, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second last element of c, k is 0, and stdin is empty. If t2 is greater than t1, then j is 2. Otherwise, i is 1.***
