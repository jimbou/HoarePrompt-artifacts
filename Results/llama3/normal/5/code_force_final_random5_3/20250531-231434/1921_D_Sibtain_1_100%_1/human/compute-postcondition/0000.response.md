The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains at least one test case and the input() function returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains at least one test case, input() function returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0**
