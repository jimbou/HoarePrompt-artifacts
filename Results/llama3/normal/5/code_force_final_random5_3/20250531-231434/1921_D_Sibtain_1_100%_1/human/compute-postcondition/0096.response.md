Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c` and the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `k` is 1, `i` is 1 if t2 is greater than t1 and 2 otherwise, `j` is 2 if t2 is greater than t1 and 1 otherwise, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `i` is now 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, and 2 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
