Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - 1)`th element of `a` and the `(len(c) - 1)`th element of `c`, and the maximum of `t1` and `t2` plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the `i`th element of `a` and the `i`th element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - j)`th element of `a` and the `(len(c) - j)`th element of `c`, `k` is 2, if `t2` is greater than `t1` then `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, the absolute difference between the `(len(a) - 1)`th element of `a` and the `(len(c) - 1)`th element of `c`, and the maximum of `t1` and `t2` plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
