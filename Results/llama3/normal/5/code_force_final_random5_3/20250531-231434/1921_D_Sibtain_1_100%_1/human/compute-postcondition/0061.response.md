Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, i is either 1 or 2, j is either 2 or 3, ans is the maximum of t1 and t2, t1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and c, t2 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second last element of c, k is 1, and stdin is empty. If t2 is greater than t1, then j is 3. Otherwise, i is 2.**
