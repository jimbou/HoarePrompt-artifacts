Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the second last element of `c`, `k` is 0, stdin is empty. The current value of `t2` is greater than the current value of `t1`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the lists `a` and `c`, as well as the relationship between `t1` and `t2`, are still valid.
