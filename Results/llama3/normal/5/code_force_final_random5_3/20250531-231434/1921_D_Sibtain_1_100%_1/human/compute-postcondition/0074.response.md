Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers in descending order, i is either 0 or the length of a, j is either 1 or the length of c, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, k is the length of a minus 1, stdin is empty**

The code block reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`, and another list of integers in descending order from stdin and assigns it to `c`. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Stdin becomes empty after reading the input.
