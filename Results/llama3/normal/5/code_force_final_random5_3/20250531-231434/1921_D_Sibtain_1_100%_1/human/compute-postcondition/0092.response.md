Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c` and the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the 0th element of `a` and the 0th element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - 1)th element of `c`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0 if `t2` is greater than `t1` and 1 otherwise, `j` is 2 if `t2` is greater than `t1` and 1 otherwise, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of the absolute differences between the first elements and the last elements of lists `a` and `c`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The input stream is still empty.
