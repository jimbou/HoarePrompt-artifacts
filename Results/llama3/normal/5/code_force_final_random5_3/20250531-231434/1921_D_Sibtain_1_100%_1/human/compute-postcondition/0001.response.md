Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers, stdin contains no input**

The code snippet reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `c`. After executing the code, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the two positive integers read from the input, and `a` and `c` are assigned the values of the two lists of integers read from the input. The input is consumed, leaving no input remaining in stdin.
