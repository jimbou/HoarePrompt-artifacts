Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, and `ans` is either `t1` + max(`t1`, `t2`) or `t2` + max(`t1`, `t2`). Otherwise, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either `t1` + max(`t1`, `t2`) or `t2` + max(`t1`, `t2`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain the same. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` can be either 1 or 2, and `j` can be either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` can be either 2 or 3, and `j` can be either 1 or 2. The value of `ans` is either the sum of `t1` and the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, or the sum of `t2` and the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.
