Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order. If all elements in a are the same, all elements in c are the same, and the first element of a is equal to the first element of c, then the state of n, m, a, and c remains unchanged. If a has only one element, the maximum absolute difference between the only element in a and the maximum or minimum element in c is being printed. Otherwise, the state of n, m, a, and c remains unchanged.***
