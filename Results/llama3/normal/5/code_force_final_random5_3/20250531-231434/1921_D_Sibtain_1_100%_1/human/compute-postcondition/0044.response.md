The `print` statement will print the maximum of two absolute differences: the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the maximum element of the sorted list `c`, and the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the minimum element of the sorted list `c`.

Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list. Similarly, since `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `max(c)` is the largest element in the list and `min(c)` is the smallest element in the list.

Therefore, the `print` statement will print the maximum of the absolute difference between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `c`, and the absolute difference between the smallest element of `a` and the smallest element of `c`.

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))) (where a[0] is the smallest element of the sorted list a, max(c) is the largest element of the sorted list c, and min(c) is the smallest element of the sorted list c)**
