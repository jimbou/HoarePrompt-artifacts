Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(c)`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as positive integers, the lists `a` and `c` remain sorted in ascending and descending order respectively, the index `i` has reached the end of list `a`, the index `j` has reached the end of list `c`, and the variable `ans` now holds the total sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` calculated at each iteration of the loop.
