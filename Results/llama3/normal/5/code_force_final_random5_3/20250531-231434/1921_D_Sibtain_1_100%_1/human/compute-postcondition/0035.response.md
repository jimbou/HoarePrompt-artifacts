The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at each iteration of the loop.

Since `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the maximum absolute difference between the elements of `a` and `c` at each iteration of the loop will be the difference between the largest element of `c` and the smallest element of `a`.

The value of `ans` will be the sum of these differences, which will be calculated as follows:

*   The first iteration of the loop will calculate the difference between the largest element of `c` (which is the first element of `c` since `c` is sorted in descending order) and the smallest element of `a` (which is the first element of `a` since `a` is sorted in ascending order).
*   The second iteration of the loop will calculate the difference between the second largest element of `c` (which is the second element of `c`) and the second smallest element of `a` (which is the second element of `a`).
*   This process will continue until the end of the lists `a` and `c` are reached.

The sum of these differences will be the value of `ans`.

Output: **the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` at each iteration of the loop**
