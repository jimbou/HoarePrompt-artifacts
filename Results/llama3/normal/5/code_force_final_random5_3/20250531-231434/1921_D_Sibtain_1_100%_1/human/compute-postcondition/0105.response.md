Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` from the start and end of the lists, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `j` is the length of `c`, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged. The variable `ans` now holds the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` from the start and end of the lists. The variables `t1` and `t2` hold the absolute differences between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, and the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, respectively. The variable `k` is now equal to the length of `a` minus 1, and the variables `i` and `j` are now equal to the length of `a` minus 1 and the length of `c`, respectively. The stdin remains empty.
