Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the second last element of `c`, `k` is 0, and stdin is empty. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The relationship between `i` and `j` based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2` is still valid. The stdin remains empty.
