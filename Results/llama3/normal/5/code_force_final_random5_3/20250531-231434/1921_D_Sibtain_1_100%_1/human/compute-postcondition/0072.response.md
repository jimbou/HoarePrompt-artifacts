Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 0 or the length of `a`, `j` is either 1 or the length of `c`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`, `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, and stdin is empty, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` which is ans is being printed**
