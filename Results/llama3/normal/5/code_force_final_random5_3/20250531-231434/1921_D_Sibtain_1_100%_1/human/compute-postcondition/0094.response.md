Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, c is a list of integers in ascending order, ans is the maximum of the absolute difference between the 0th element of a and the 0th element of c and the absolute difference between the (len(a) - 1)th element of a and the (len(c) - 1)th element of c, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, k is 1, i is 0 if t2 is greater than t1 and 1 otherwise, j is 2 if t2 is greater than t1 and 1 otherwise, stdin is empty.**

The code modifies the values of `t1` and `t2` based on the values of `i` and `j`, which are determined by the comparison between `t2` and `t1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, and stdin remain unchanged.
