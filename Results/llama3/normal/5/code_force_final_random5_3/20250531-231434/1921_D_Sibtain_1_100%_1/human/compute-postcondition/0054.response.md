Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the second last element of `c`, `k` is 0, and `t1` is larger than or equal to `t2`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
