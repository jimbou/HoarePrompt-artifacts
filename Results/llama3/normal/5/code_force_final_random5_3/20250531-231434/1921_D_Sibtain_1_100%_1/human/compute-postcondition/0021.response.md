Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either `t1` or `t2`, `k` is 0, the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c` (t1) and the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c` (t2) have been calculated, and either `t2` is greater than `t1` or `t1` is greater than or equal to `t2`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, which means it now holds the larger of the two absolute differences. The other variables remain unchanged.
