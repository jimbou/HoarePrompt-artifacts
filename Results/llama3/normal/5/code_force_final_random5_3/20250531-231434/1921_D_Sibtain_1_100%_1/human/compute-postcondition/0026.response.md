Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, c is a sorted list of integers in descending order, k is 1, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c. If t2 > t1, then i is either 0 or 1, j is either 2 or 3, and ans is either t1 or t2. Otherwise, i is either 1 or 2, j is either 1 or 2, and ans is either t1 or t2.***
