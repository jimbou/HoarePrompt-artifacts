Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, and `t1` is greater than or equal to `t2`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
