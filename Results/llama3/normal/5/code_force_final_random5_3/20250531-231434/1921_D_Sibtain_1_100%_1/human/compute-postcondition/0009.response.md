Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with exactly one element, which means `a[0]` is the only element in the list.
* `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
* Since all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, we can conclude that `a[0]` is equal to the first element of `c`, which is also the maximum element of `c` (since `c` is in descending order).
* `max(c)` returns the maximum element of `c`, which is equal to `a[0]`.
* `min(c)` returns the minimum element of `c`, which is also equal to `a[0]` (since all elements in `c` are the same).
* `abs(a[0] - max(c))` and `abs(a[0] - min(c))` both evaluate to 0, since `a[0]` is equal to both `max(c)` and `min(c)`.
* `max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c)))` returns the maximum of these two values, which is 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **0**
