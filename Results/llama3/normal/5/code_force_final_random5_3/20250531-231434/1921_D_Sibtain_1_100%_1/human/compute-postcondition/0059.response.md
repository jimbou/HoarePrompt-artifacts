Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the second last element of `c`, `k` is 1, and stdin is empty. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition "If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 1" is still valid, but now `j` can be 3 if `t2` is greater than `t1`.
