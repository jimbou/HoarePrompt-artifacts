Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between the ith element of `a` and the ith element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of `a` and the (len(c) - j)th element of `c`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, and `ans` is either `t1 + max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + max(t1, t2)`. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either `t1 + max(t1, t2)` or `t2 + max(t1, t2)`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `i`, `j`, and `ans` are still valid, but the value of `ans` has been increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.
