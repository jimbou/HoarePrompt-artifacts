Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, c is a list of integers in descending order, i is either 0 or the length of a, j is either 1 or the length of c, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c, t1 is the absolute difference between the ith element of a and the ith element of c, t2 is the absolute difference between the (len(a) - j)th element of a and the (len(c) - j)th element of c, k is the length of a minus 1, stdin is empty, and the number 0 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the most internal loop. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the current iteration is skipped.
