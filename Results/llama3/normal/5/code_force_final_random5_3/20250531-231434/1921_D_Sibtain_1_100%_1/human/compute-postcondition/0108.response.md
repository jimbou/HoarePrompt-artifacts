Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers in ascending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` from the start and end of the lists, `t1` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`, `k` is the length of `a` minus 1, `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `j` is the length of `c`, stdin is empty, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` from the start and end of the lists which is `ans` is being printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and has printed the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `c` from the start and end of the lists. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are as described above, and stdin is empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
