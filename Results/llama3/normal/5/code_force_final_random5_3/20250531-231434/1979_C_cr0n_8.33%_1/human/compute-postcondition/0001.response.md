According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `vals`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and prod is 1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the r is the first integer in the list.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of n integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, r is the first integer in the list, prod is 1**
