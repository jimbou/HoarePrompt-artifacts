Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of n integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `r` is the first integer in the list, `prod` is equal to `r` times 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**

In this output state, the value of `prod` has been updated to be equal to the first integer in the list `vals` (which is `r`) multiplied by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
