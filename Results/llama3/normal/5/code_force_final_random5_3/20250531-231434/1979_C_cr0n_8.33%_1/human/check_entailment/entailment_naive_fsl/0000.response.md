Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The strategy is to calculate the product of all the multipliers, and then for each outcome, calculate the amount of coins to bet as the product divided by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program correctly handles the case where it is not possible to distribute the coins in such a way, by checking if the denominator (prod - sum(vprod)) is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of outcomes is 1, by calculating the product of the single multiplier and then dividing it by the multiplier to get the amount of coins to bet.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
