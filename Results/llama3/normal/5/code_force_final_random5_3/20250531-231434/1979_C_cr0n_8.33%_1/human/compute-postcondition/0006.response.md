Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of n integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `r` is the third integer in the list, `prod` is equal to `r` times `r` times `r` times 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `prod` has been updated to be equal to `r` times `r` times `r` times 2, which is the result of multiplying the original value of `prod` (which was `r` times `r` times 2) by `r`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
