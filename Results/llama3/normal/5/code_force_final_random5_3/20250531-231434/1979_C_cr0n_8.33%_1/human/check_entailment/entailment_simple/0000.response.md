Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (N) and the multipliers for each outcome (vals).

The program then calculates the product of all multipliers (prod) and the product of all multipliers except each individual multiplier (vprod). The denominator (den) is calculated as the product minus the sum of vprod.

If the denominator is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the values in vprod, which represent the bets on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1()` is not defined anywhere in the program.
2. The program uses `return` without specifying a value, which is not necessary in this case.
3. The program prints an empty string when the denominator is greater than 0, which is not the expected output.

Despite these issues, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
