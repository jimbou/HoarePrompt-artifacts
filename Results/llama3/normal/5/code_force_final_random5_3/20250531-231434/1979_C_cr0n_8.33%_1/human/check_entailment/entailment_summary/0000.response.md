Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program works by first calculating the product of all the multipliers (k_i) for each outcome. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the multiplier with respect to the product. This is done by dividing the product by the multiplier.

The program then checks if the denominator of the modular multiplicative inverse (which is the product minus the sum of the modular multiplicative inverses) is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

If the denominator is greater than 0, the program prints the modular multiplicative inverses of the multipliers, which represent the bets on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
