Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is an empty list, r is the last integer in the list, prod is equal to the product of all integers in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of N remains unchanged, the list of values (vals) is now empty because all its elements have been processed, the variable r holds the last integer that was processed in the list, the product (prod) is the result of multiplying all the integers in the list together, and there is one less test case in the standard input (stdin).
