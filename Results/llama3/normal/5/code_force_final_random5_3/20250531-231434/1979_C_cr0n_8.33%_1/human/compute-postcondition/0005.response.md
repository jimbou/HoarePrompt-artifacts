The only variable in the loop head is variable  r, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `vals`. If `vals` has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `vals` has at least 2 integers, `r` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `r` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of n integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `r` is the third integer in the list, `prod` is equal to `r` times `r` times 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**
