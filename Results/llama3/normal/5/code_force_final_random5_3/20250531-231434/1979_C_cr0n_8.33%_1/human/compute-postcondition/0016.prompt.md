You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 50). The second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20).
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is an empty list, r is the last integer in the list, prod is equal to the product of all integers in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The current state of the variables remains unchanged: N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list, r is the last integer in the list, prod is equal to the product of all integers in the list, vprod is a list, den is equal to prod and the current value of den is less than or equal to 0, and -1 has been printed.
    #State: *N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is an empty list, r is the last integer in the list, prod is equal to the product of all integers in the list, vprod is an empty list, den is equal to prod and is larger than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: (an empty string)

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The current state of the variables remains unchanged: N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list, r is the last integer in the list, prod is equal to the product of all integers in the list, vprod is a list, den is equal to prod and the current value of den is less than or equal to 0, and -1 has been printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
