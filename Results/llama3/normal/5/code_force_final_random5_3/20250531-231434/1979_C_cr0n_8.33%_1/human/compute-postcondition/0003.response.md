The only variables in the loop head are variables  `r` and `vals`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `vals`.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `vals` has at least 1 integer, `r` is the first integer in the list, `prod` is equal to `r` times 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `r` is the second integer in the list and `prod` is equal to `r` times 2.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of n integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `r` is the second integer in the list, `prod` is equal to `r` times 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**
