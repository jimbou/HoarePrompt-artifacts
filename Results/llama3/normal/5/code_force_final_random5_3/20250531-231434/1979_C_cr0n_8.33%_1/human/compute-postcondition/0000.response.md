Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of n integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod is 1**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to N. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines, this line consumes the first line of one test case, leaving the remaining test cases in stdin. The second line reads a list of n integers from stdin and assigns it to vals. This line consumes the second line of the same test case, leaving stdin with one less test case. The third line initializes prod to 1, which does not affect any other variables.
