Based on the initial state, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, but its value is not used in the print statement.
* `vals` is an empty list, which means it has no elements.
* `r` is the last integer in the list `vals`, but since `vals` is empty, `r` is undefined (or None).
* `prod` is equal to the product of all integers in the list `vals`, but since `vals` is empty, `prod` is also undefined (or None).
* `vprod` is an empty list, which means it has no elements.
* `den` is equal to `prod` and is larger than 0, but since `prod` is undefined, `den` is also undefined (or None).

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))`

This statement uses a list comprehension to convert each element `x` in the list `vprod` to a string using `str(x)`. The resulting list of strings is then joined together with spaces in between using the `' '.join()` method.

Since `vprod` is an empty list, the list comprehension will produce an empty list of strings. Therefore, the `join()` method will return an empty string.

Output: **(an empty string)**
