Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `N` and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
2. The program calculates the product of all integers in the list `vals` and stores it in `prod`.
3. The program calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of each integer in the list `vals` using the formula `(prod // r)` and stores them in `vprod`.
4. The program calculates the denominator `den` of the modular multiplicative inverse by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from `prod`.
5. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.
6. If `den` is greater than 0, the program prints the modular multiplicative inverses of the integers in the list `vals`, which represents the bets on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of the modular multiplicative inverse is a clever way to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
