Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of n integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `r` is the second integer in the list, `prod` is equal to `r` times `r` times 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial properties, but the value of `prod` has been updated to be the product of the second integer in the list (`r`) times itself times 2. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
