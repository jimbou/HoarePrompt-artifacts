Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a list containing 1 integer: 1000, i is n-1, and the string result containing the elements of a separated by spaces is printed, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, `n` has been updated to a new integer value between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `T` now contains a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The list `a` has been reinitialized to contain only the integer 1000. The value of `i` remains `n-1`. The string `result` still contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces, but since `a` now only contains one element, `result` will only contain the string "1000". Stdin is empty as all inputs have been consumed.
