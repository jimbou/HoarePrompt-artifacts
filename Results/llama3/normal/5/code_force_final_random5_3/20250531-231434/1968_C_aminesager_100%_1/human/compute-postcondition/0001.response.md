According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**
