According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive). So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + sum(T), `i` is n-1, and the string `result` containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces is printed**
