Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], i is n-1, and the string result containing the elements of a separated by spaces is printed, stdin contains no input.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still within its original range, and `T` is still a list of `n-1` integers within its original range. The list `a` has grown to contain `n` integers, where each integer is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` up to that point. The variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`, and the string `result` contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces, which is printed. The input from `stdin` remains empty.
