Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + sum(T), and `i` is n-1, and stdin contains no input**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t` and `n` as in the initial state. The list `T` will remain unchanged. The list `a` will contain `n` integers, where each integer is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` up to that index. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The stdin will still contain no input.
