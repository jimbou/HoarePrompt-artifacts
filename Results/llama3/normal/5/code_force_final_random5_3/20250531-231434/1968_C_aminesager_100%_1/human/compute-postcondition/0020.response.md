Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing 4 integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], and `i` is 3, and stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the third element of `a` (i.e., 1000 + T[0] + T[1]) and the third element of `T` (i.e., T[2]). The other variables remain unchanged.
