Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then no integers x_i.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still between 2 and 500, `T` is still a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, and `a` is now a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` up to that point. The loop variable `i` has reached `n-1`, and there are no more integers `x_i` left in the input.
