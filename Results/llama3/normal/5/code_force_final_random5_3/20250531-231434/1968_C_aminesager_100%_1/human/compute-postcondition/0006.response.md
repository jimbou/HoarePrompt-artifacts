Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing three integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-3 integers x_4,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`, which is the sum of the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i - 1]`) and the `i - 1`-th element of `T`. Since `i` is 2, this means that the new element is `a[1] + T[1]`, which is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple inputs, but the first input `n` and the first `n-2` integers `x_3,...,x_n` have been consumed, leaving `n-3` integers `x_4,...,x_n`.
