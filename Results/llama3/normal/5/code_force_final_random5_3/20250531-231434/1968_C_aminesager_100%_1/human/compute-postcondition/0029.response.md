To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `t`, `T`, `a`, and `result`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 3 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing 2 integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 2, and the string result containing the elements of a separated by spaces is printed, stdin contains no input.**
