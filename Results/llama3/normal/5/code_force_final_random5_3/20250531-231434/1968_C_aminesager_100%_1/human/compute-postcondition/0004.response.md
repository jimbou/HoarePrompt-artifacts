Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing two integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-2 integers x_3,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include a new element, which is the sum of the first element of `a` (1000) and the first element of `T` (T[0]). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
