Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then no integers x_i.**

In this output state, the value of `result` is a string that contains the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. The list `a` contains `n` integers, where each integer is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `T`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
