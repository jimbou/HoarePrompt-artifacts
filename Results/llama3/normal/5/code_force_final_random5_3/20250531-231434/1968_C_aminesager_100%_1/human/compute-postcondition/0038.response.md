Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and n-1 integers x_2 to x_n. It then calculates a list of n integers, where the first element is 1000 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding x_i. Finally, it prints the calculated list as a string of space-separated integers. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.**
