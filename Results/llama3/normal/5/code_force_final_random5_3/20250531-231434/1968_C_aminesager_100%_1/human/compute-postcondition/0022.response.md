Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + sum(T), `i` is n-1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `result` is a string that contains the elements of list `a` separated by spaces. The list `a` is constructed by adding 1000 to the cumulative sum of the elements in list `T`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `T`, `a`, and `i` retain their original values and ranges as specified in the initial state. The stdin remains empty as no input is read or modified.
