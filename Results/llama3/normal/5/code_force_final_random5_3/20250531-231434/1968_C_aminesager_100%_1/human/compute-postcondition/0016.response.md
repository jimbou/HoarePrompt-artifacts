Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing 2 integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1, and stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the first element of `a` (1000) and the first element of `T` (T[0]). The values of `t`, `n`, `T`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input.
