The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin initially contains multiple inputs, starting with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). After accepting the first input, the stdin will contain the remaining inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).**
