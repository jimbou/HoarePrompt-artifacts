The code prints the string result containing the elements of the list a separated by spaces. The list a is defined as a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]. The values of T are integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and n is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The string result is created by concatenating the elements of a separated by spaces.

Output: **1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2] (where T[i] are integers between 1 and 500, and n is an integer between 2 and 500)**
