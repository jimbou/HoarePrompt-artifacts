To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `t`, `T`, `a`, and `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing two integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-2 integers x_3,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**
