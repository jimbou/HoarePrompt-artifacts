Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the `n-1` integers `x_2` to `x_n`.
3.  It initializes the list `a` with the first element as 1000, which satisfies the condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
4.  It then calculates the subsequent elements of `a` by adding the corresponding `x_i` to the previous element of `a`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_(i-1)` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.
5.  Finally, it prints the calculated list `a` as a string of space-separated integers.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, and the provided example output matches the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
