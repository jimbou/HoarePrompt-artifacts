Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], i is n-1, result is a string containing the elements of a separated by spaces, and the string result containing the elements of a separated by spaces is printed, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of result is updated to be a string containing the elements of a separated by spaces. The string result is also printed. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
