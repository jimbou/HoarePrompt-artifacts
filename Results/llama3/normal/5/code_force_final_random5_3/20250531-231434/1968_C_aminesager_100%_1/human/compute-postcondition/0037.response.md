Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a list containing n integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + sum(T), i is n-1, result is a string containing the elements of a separated by spaces, and the string result containing the elements of a separated by spaces is printed, stdin contains no input.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable t is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variables n, T, a, i, and result retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable n is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a list containing n integers where each element is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in T, i is n-1, and result is a string containing the elements of a separated by spaces. Additionally, the string result containing the elements of a separated by spaces is printed, and stdin contains no input.
