Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing four integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-4 integers x_5,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the third element of `a` (1000 + T[0] + T[1]) and the third element of `T` (T[2]). The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin now contains one less input, as one integer has been consumed to calculate the new element of `a`.
