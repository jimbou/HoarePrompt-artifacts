Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-2 integers x_3,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500), n is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), T is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), a is a list containing a single integer 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing two integers: 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-2 integers x_3,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing three integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-3 integers x_4,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing four integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (2 <= n <= 500), then n-4 integers x_5,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
