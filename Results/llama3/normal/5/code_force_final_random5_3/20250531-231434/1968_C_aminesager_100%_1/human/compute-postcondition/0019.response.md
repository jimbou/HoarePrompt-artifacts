The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing 3 integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and `i` is 3, and stdin contains no input**
