Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `T` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing 3 integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and `i` is 2, and stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the second last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i - 1]`) and the second element of `T` (i.e., `T[i - 1]`). The values of `t`, `n`, `T`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as there is no input operation performed in the given code.
