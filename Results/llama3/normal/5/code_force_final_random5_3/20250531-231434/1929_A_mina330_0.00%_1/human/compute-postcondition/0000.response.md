Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains ntest test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `ntest` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin still contains the test cases, but the number of test cases is now specified by the value of `ntest`. Each test case still consists of an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, with the same constraints as before.
