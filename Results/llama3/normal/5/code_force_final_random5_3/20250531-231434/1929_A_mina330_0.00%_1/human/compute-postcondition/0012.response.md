To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `ntest`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `itest` is less than `ntest`. At the end of the previous iteration, `itest` is 0 and `ntest` is at least 1. To execute the loop again, `itest` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`ntest` is at least 1, `itest` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the end and start of `a`, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`**
