Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between adjacent elements, and the program sorts the array in ascending order to maximize these differences.

The program correctly handles the case where the array has an even number of elements, where the middle elements are paired and their differences are added to the total beauty. The program also correctly handles the case where the array has an odd number of elements, where the middle element is not paired and its difference is not added to the total beauty.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array has only two elements, or when all elements in the array are the same.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
