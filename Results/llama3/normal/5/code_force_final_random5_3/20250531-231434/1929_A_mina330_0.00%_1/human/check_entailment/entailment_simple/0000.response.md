Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements, sorts the array, and then calculates the sum of the differences between corresponding elements from the end and the start of the array.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by placing the largest element at the end and the smallest element at the start, and then alternating between the next largest and next smallest elements. This is because the difference between consecutive elements is maximized when the largest element is subtracted from the smallest element.

The program correctly implements this strategy by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between corresponding elements from the end and the start of the array.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
