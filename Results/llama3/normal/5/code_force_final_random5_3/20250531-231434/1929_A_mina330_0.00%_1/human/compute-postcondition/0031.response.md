Output State: `ntest` is at least 3, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + 2 * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i])`, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`, stdin contains no input

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, since the loop will execute `len(a) // 2` times. The value of `i` will be `len(a) // 2 - 1` after the loop finishes, and the value of `kq` will be the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a`.
