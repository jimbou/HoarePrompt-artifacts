Output State: `ntest` is at least 3, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + (len(a) // 2 - 1) * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i])`, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`, stdin contains no input

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of `kq` and `i`. The value of `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a`, multiplied by the number of iterations of the loop. The value of `i` is the last index of the loop, which is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
