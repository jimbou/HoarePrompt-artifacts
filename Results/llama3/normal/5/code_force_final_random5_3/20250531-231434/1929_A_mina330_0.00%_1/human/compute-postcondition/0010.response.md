The code prints the value of `kq`, which is the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the end and start of the sorted list `a`.

Since `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, the differences between corresponding elements from the end and start of `a` will be calculated and summed up to get the value of `kq`.

Output: **the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the end and start of the sorted list a**
