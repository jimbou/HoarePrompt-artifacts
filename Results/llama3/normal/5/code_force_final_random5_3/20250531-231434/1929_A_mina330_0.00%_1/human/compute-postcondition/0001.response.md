The only variables in the loop head are variables  `itest` and `ntest`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ntest`. If `ntest` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, so it needs to be adjusted to `ntest` is at least 1 and `itest` is 0. 

State: **`ntest` is at least 1, `itest` is 0**
