To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The length of `a` remains the same, so `len(a) // 2` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`ntest` is at least 1, `itest` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains no input**
