Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order and calculates the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the end and start of the sorted list.

The key insight to the problem is that the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of differences between adjacent elements, and the maximum difference between two elements is achieved when the smaller element is placed before the larger element.

The program correctly implements this insight by sorting the integers in ascending order and calculating the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the end and start of the sorted list. The program also correctly handles the case where the length of the array is even, by only considering the differences between elements up to the middle of the array.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
