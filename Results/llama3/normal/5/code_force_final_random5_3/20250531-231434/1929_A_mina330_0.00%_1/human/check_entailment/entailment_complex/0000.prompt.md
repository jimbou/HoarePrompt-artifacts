Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: ntest is at least 1, itest is ntest - 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, kq is the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the end and start of a, i is len(a) // 2 - 1, stdin contains no input, and the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the end and the start of a which is kq is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, calculates the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the end and start of the sorted list, and prints this sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
