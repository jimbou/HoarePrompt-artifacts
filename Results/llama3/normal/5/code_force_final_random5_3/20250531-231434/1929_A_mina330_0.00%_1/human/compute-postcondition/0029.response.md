The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 (because the step is 1) and `a` must still have at least 2 elements.

State: **`ntest` is at least 3, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `i` is 2, stdin contains no input**
