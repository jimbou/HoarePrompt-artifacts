Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, calculates the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the end and start of the sorted list, and prints this sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.**
