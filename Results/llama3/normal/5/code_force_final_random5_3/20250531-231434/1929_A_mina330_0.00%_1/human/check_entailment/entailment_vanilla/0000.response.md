Reasoning:

1. The problem asks us to find the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.

3. The program then sorts the array in ascending order.

4. The program then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between the elements at the end of the array and the elements at the beginning of the array. This is done by iterating over the first half of the array and adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning.

5. The program then prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

6. The program's approach is correct because by sorting the array, it ensures that the largest elements are at the end and the smallest elements are at the beginning. This maximizes the differences between consecutive elements, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

7. The program's implementation is also correct because it correctly calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between the elements at the end and the beginning.

8. The program handles the case where the array has an odd length correctly by only iterating over the first half of the array.

9. The program also handles the case where all elements in the array are the same correctly by returning a beauty of 0.

10. The program's time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the array. This is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
