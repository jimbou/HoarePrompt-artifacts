Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first three elements being 0, `x[0]`, and `x[0] + x[1]`, and the rest being undefined, `i` is 2, `_` is undefined, stdin contains no inputs**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which is `x[0] + x[1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
