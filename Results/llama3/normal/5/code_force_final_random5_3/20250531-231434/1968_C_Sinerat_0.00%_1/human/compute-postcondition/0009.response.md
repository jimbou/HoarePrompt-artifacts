The code prints the elements of the list `a` which is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of 500 and the corresponding elements in list `x`. Since the exact elements of list `x` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of list `a`.


Output: **[500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]] (where x[i] is the ith element of the list x)**
