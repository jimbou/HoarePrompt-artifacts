According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains a series of test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains a series of test cases, _ is 0, input is at least 1**
