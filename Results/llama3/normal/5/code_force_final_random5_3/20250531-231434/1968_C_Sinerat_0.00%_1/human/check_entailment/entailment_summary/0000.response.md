Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers.
2.  It initializes the first element of the list `a` to 500, which satisfies the condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
3.  The program then calculates the remaining elements of the list `a` by adding the corresponding element from the input list `x` to the previous element in `a`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`, as required by the problem statement.
4.  Finally, the program prints the list `a`, which satisfies the conditions specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
