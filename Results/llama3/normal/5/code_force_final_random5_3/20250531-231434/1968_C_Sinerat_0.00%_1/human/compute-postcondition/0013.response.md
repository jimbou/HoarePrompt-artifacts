The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 0 and the rest being undefined, `i` is 1, `_` is undefined, stdin contains no inputs**
