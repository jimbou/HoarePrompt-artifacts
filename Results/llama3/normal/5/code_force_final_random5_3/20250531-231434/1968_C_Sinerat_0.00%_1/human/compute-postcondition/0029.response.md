Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, the third element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, the fourth element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`, and the fourth element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]` + `x[3]`, and the rest being undefined, `_` is any value, `stdin` is empty, and the list `a` is not being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, `i` is still 3, `x` is still a list of integers from the input, and `_` is still any value. The list `a` has been updated such that its fourth element is now 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]` + `x[3]`. The first three elements of `a` remain the same, and the rest of the elements are still undefined. The stdin is still empty, and the list `a` is still not being printed.
