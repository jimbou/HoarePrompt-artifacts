Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 500). The second line contains n-1 integers (1 <= x_i <= 500).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 500
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, i is n - 1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of length n with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of 500 and the corresponding elements in x, _ is 0, and the elements of list a are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, x is a list of integers, a is a list of length n with the first element being 0 and the rest being the cumulative sum of x, i is n-1, _ is undefined, stdin contains no inputs, and the list a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of integers from the input, a is a list of length n with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of x, i is n-1, _ is any value, stdin is empty, and the list a is being printed. The list a contains the first element 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
