Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, the third element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and the rest being 0, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, which is equivalent to `a[2] = a[1] + x[1]`. Since `a[1]` is `500 + x[0]` and `x[1]` is an integer, the third element of `a` is now `500 + x[0] + x[1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
