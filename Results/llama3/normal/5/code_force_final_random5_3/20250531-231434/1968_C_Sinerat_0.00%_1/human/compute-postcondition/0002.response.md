According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500 and the rest being 0, and `_` is 0. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted. `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500 and the rest being 0, `_` is 0**
