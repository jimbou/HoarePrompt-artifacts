The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding the value of `x[i - 1]` to the value of `a[i - 1]`. 

Since `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]` which is 500, and `x[i - 1]` is `x[0]`. Therefore, `a[1]` is updated to be 500 + `x[0]`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500 and the second element being 500 + `x[0]` and the rest being 0, `_` is 0**
