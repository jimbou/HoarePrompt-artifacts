To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is already greater than 2, it remains the same.

The other variables, `x`, `a`, and `_`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, the third element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and the rest being 0, `_` is 0**
