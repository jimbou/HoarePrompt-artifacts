To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is already at least 2, it remains the same.

The other variables, `x`, `a`, `_`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500 and the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, and the rest being undefined, `_` is any value, `stdin` is empty, and the list `a` is not being printed.**
