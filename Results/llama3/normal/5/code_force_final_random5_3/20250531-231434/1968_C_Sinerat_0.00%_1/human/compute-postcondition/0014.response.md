Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first two elements being 0 and `x[0]`, and the rest being undefined, `i` is 1, `_` is undefined, stdin contains no inputs**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which is equivalent to `x[0]` since `i` is 1 and `a[0]` is 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
