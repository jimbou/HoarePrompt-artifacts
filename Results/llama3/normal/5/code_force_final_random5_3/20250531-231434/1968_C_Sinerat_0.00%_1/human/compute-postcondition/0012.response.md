Output State: **n is an integer, x is a list of integers, a is a list of length n with the first element being 0 and the rest being undefined, i is undefined, _ is undefined, stdin contains no inputs**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, overwriting its initial value as a positive integer. Then, it assigns a list of integers from the input to `x`, overwriting its initial value as a list of integers. The third line creates a new list `a` of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, overwriting its initial value as a list of length `n` with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of 500 and the corresponding elements in `x`. The fourth line assigns 500 to the first element of `a`, but since the rest of the elements are still 0, the list `a` is now a list of length `n` with the first element being 500 and the rest being 0. The variables `i` and `_` are not modified by the code, so their values are undefined. Stdin is now empty since all inputs have been consumed.
