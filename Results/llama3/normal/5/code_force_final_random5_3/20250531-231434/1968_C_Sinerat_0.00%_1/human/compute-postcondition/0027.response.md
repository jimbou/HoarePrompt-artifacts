Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, and the third element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and the rest being undefined, `_` is any value, `stdin` is empty, and the list `a` is not being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the corresponding element `x[i - 1]` from the list `x`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
