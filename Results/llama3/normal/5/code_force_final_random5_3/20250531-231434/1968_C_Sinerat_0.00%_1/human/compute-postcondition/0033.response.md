Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of integers from the input, a is a list of length n with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of x, i is n-1, _ is any value, stdin is empty, and the list a is being printed. The list a contains the first element 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of x.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of n remains the same as the input value, x is still a list of integers from the input, and a is a list of length n where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the corresponding elements in x. The variable i is still n-1, _ can be any value, stdin is empty because all inputs have been processed, and the list a is being printed.
