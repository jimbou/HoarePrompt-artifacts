Output State: **n is an integer, x is a list of integers, a is a list of length n with the first element being 0 and the rest being the cumulative sum of x, i is n-1, _ is undefined, stdin contains no inputs**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'n' remains an integer, 'x' remains a list of integers, and 'a' becomes a list of length 'n' where the first element is 0 and the rest are the cumulative sum of the elements in 'x'. The variable 'i' becomes 'n-1' since it is the last index in the range, and '_' remains undefined. The stdin remains empty as no inputs are provided.
