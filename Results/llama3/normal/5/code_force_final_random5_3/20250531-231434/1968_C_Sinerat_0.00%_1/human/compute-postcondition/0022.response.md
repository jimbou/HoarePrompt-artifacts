The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If the input from `stdin` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains no inputs, so for the loop to execute again `stdin` must contain at least one input. `_` is undefined, so it can be any value.
State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 0 and the rest being the cumulative sum of `x`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is any value, `stdin` contains at least one input, and the list `a` is being printed**
