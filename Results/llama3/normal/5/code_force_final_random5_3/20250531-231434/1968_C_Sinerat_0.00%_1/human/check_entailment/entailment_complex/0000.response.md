Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values for each test case, including the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `x`.
2. It initializes the list `a` with the first element being 500, which satisfies the condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
3. The program then calculates the remaining elements of `a` by adding the corresponding element from `x` to the previous element of `a`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`, as required by the problem statement.
4. Finally, the program prints the list `a`, which contains the desired values that satisfy the problem conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
