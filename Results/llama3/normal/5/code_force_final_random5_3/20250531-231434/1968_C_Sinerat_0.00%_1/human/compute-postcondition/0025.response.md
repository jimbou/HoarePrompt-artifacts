Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500 and the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, and the rest being undefined, `_` is any value, `stdin` is empty, and the list `a` is not being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, where `i` is 1. Since `a[0]` is 500 and `x[0]` is an integer from the input, the second element of `a` is now 500 + `x[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
