Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of integers from the input, a is a list of length n with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of x, i is n-1, _ is any value, stdin is empty, and the list a is not being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'a' will contain the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of list 'x'. The variable 'i' will be one less than the input value 'n'. The other variables remain unchanged.
