Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n-1 integers. It then generates a new list a of length n, where the first element is 500 and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of the input list. Finally, it prints the list a. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the corresponding lists a for each case.**
