The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a`. The list `a` is described as having a length of `n`, with the first element being 0 and the rest being the cumulative sum of the list `x`.

Since `i` is equal to `n-1`, we know that the list `a` has `n` elements. The first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the cumulative sum of the list `x`.

Let's denote the elements of the list `x` as `x_1`, `x_2`, ..., `x_n`. Then, the elements of the list `a` can be described as:

* `a[0] = 0`
* `a[1] = x_1`
* `a[2] = x_1 + x_2`
* ...
* `a[n-1] = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n`

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0, x_1, x_1 + x_2, ..., x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n**

Note that the exact values of the elements in the list `x` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the cumulative sum of the list `x`, starting from 0.
