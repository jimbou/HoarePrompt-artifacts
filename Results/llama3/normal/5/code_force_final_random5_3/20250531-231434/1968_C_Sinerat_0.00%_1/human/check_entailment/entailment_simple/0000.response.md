Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.
* It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with the first element being 500, which satisfies the condition `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
* It then calculates the remaining elements of `a` using the formula `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`, because `a_i` is the smallest possible value that satisfies the condition.
* Finally, it prints the array `a`, which satisfies all the conditions of the problem.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
