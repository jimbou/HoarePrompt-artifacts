Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, the third element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, the fourth element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`, and the rest being 0, `_` is 0**

The value of `a[i]` is updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, `a[3]` is updated to be the sum of `a[2]` and `x[2]`. The value of `a[2]` is 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, so `a[3]` becomes 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
