Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is n - 1, x is a list of integers, a is a list of length n with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of 500 and the corresponding elements in x, _ is 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n - 1`, and the list `a` has been updated such that each element at index `i` (starting from 1) is the cumulative sum of 500 and the corresponding elements in the list `x` up to index `i - 1`. The other variables, `n`, `x`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
