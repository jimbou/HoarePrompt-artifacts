Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program uses the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` to check if it's possible to build the tower. This condition is based on the fact that the number of moves (n) must be greater than or equal to the number of cubes (m) in the tower, and the difference between n and m must be even. This is because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be an even number.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
