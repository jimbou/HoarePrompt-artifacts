Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program uses a simple and correct logic to solve the problem. It checks two conditions:

1.  If n is greater than or equal to m, which ensures that there are enough moves to add at least m cubes to the tower.
2.  If the difference between n and m is even, which ensures that the remaining moves (after adding m cubes) can be used to remove an even number of cubes, effectively not changing the height of the tower.

If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible input scenarios and provides the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
