Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin is empty, _ is t-1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all `t` iterations, and the loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `t-1`. The input buffer `stdin` is now empty, as all input lines have been processed. The values of `n` and `m` are still within the range of 1 to 100, but their specific values are no longer relevant, as the loop has finished executing. The output state also reflects that the loop has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration, depending on the condition being met.
