Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), _ is 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.***
