Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

2. The given program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve this problem. It iterates over each test case, reads the values of n and m, and checks two conditions:
   - If n is greater than or equal to m, it means that there are enough moves to add at least m cubes to the tower.
   - If the difference between n and m (n - m) is even, it means that the remaining moves (after adding m cubes) can be used to remove an even number of cubes, which is always possible.

3. If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the range of values for n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).

5. The program also correctly handles the example test cases provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
