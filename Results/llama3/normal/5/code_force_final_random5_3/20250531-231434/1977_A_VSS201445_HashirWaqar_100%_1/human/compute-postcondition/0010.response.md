Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), _ is 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the new values read from the input, which are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1.
