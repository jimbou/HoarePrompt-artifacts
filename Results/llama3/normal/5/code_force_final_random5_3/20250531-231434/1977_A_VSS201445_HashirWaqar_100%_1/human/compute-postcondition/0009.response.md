The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `int(input())` is unknown but greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), _ is 1**
