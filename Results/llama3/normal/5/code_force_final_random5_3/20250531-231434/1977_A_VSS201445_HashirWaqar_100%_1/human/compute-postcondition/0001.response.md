Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to be integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, as they are assigned the values from the input. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m, as one line has been consumed by the input() function. The value of `_` remains 0, as it is not affected by the code.
