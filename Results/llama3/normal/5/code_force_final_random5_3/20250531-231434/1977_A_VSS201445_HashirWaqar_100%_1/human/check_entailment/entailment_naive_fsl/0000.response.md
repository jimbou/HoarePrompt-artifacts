Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` checks whether the number of moves is sufficient to build the tower and whether the remaining moves can be used to remove cubes from the top of the tower to reach the desired height.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If n is less than m, it's impossible to build the tower, so the program prints "NO".
* If n is greater than or equal to m, but (n - m) is odd, it's impossible to remove the remaining cubes to reach the desired height, so the program prints "NO".
* If n is greater than or equal to m and (n - m) is even, it's possible to build the tower, so the program prints "YES".

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n and m are both 1, or when n is much larger than m.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
