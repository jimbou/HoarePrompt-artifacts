Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program uses a simple logic: if n is greater than or equal to m and the difference between n and m is even, it prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with m cubes. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This logic is correct because:

* If n is less than m, it's impossible to build a tower with m cubes, since Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time.
* If n is greater than or equal to m, but the difference between n and m is odd, it's also impossible to build a tower with m cubes. This is because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the number of cubes in the tower can only change by 1. If the difference between n and m is odd, it means that Nikita would need to add or remove a fraction of a cube, which is not possible.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **True**
