The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since the stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers, the first line is read and its values are assigned to `n` and `m`. The remaining t-3 lines are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers, _ is 2**
