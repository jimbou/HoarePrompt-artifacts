The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input(). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input(). If the input() is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), input() must be at least 1, _ is 0**
