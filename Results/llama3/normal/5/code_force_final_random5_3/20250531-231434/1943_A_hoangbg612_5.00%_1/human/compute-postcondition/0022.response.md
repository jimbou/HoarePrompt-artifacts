Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 3 if cur is -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 3 if cur is equal to the second integer in the list N and greater than -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 2.**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1. If cur is -1, the value of M[-1] is now 3. If cur is not -1, the value of M[cur] is now 3 if cur is equal to the second integer in the list N and greater than -1, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
