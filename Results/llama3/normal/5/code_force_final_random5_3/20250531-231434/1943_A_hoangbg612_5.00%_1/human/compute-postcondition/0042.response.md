The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed, cur is the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i, or cur is equal to the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. and cur is printed**
