Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, and cur is the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i, or -1 if no such integer exists.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `cur` has been updated to the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i]` is greater than `i`. If no such integer exists, `cur` is set to -1. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
