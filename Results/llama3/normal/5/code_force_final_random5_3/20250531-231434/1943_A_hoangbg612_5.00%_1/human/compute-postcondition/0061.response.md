Postcondition: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is updated to the third element in the list N plus 1 if it is greater than 0, or 0 if the third element in the list N is less than or equal to -1. Otherwise, if num is greater than cur, then cur is updated to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of M[cur] is incremented by 1 if cur is -1, or the value of M[i] is incremented by 1 if cur is equal to i.**
