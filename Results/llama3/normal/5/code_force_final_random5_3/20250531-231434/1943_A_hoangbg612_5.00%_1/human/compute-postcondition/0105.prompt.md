Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, and cur is -1, and the value of cur is being printed, and stdin contains 1 less input: an integer
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list `N`, and key equal to each integer `i` in the list `N` that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times `i` appears in the list `N`, `cur` is either -1 or the first element in the list `N`, and the value of `cur` is being printed, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer, `num` is the first element in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, the count of -1 in dictionary `M` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is either -1 or the first element in the list N, and the value of cur is being printed, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer, num is the second element in the list N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is updated to num and the count of the second element in the dictionary M is 1. Otherwise, the count of -1 in dictionary M is incremented by 1, and the count of cur in dictionary M is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer, num is the third element in the list N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is the third element in the list N and M[cur] is 1. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N plus one if cur is -1, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N plus one if cur is i, and the value of cur is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
