Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. The sum of the values in dictionary M equals S.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T remains greater than 0, the value of _ remains 0, the value of S remains an integer, the list N remains empty, the number of test cases in stdin remains multiple minus two, the value of cur is incremented by 1 if it was greater than -1, otherwise it becomes 0, and the dictionary M remains unchanged with the same keys and values. The sum of the values in dictionary M still equals S.
