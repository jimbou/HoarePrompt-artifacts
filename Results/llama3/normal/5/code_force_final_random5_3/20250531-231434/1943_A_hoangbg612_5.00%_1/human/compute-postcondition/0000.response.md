The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `T`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).

Since `T` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `T` is now equal to the number of test cases.

The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).

Output State: **`T` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).**
