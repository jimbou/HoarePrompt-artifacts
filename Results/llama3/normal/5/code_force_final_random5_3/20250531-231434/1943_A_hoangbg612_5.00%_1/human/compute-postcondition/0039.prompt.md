Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed, cur must be greater than 0. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is set to i.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed, cur must be greater than 0. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is set to i. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed, cur must be greater than 1. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is set to i. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed, i is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
