Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is 1 and i is 1. Otherwise, cur is greater than 0 and i is 1.***
