Output State: **T is equal to 0, _ is equal to T, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains no test cases, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the value of M[i] is less than or equal to the value of i, then cur is equal to the smallest integer i such that M[i] is less than or equal to i, otherwise cur is equal to the last element in the original list N plus 1, and cur is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing all the test cases. The variable T, which represents the number of test cases, is now equal to 0. The variable _, which is used to iterate over the range of T, is also equal to T. The variable S, which represents the number of integers in each test case, is still an integer. The list N, which stores the integers in each test case, is now empty. The stdin, which contains the test cases, now contains no test cases. The dictionary M, which stores the count of each integer in the original list N, remains unchanged. The variable cur, which stores the smallest integer i such that M[i] is less than or equal to i, or the last element in the original list N plus 1, is printed.
