Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is either the third element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the third element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If num is greater than cur, then cur is updated to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of M[cur] is incremented by 1 if cur is -1, or the value of M[i] is incremented by 1 if cur is equal to i.***
