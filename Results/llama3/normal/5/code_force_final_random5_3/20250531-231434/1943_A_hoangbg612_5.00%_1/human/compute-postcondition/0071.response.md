The code snippet consists of two lines: `cur = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, and the second line is a break statement that terminates the loop.

Since `i` is 0, `cur` becomes 0. No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is 0, i is 0**
