Output: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the value of M[i] is less than or equal to the value of i, then cur is equal to the smallest integer i such that M[i] is less than or equal to i, otherwise cur is equal to the last element in the original list N plus 1, and cur is printed**
