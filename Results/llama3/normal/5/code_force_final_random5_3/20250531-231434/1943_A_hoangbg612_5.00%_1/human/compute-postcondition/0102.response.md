Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is the third element in the list N, and M[cur] is 1.**

In this output state, the value of T remains greater than 2, and the value of _ remains 2. The value of S remains an integer. The list N remains a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements. The dictionary M remains unchanged except for the key cur, which is now the third element in the list N, and its value is set to 1. The variable cur is now the third element in the list N.
