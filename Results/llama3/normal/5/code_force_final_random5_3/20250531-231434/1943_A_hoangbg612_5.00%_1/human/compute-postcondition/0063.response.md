Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N plus 1 if cur is -1, or key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N plus 1 if cur is equal to i, cur is either the third element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the third element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T remains greater than 1, the value of _ remains 1, the value of S remains an integer, the list N remains sorted with at least 3 elements, the dictionary M has its value for the key -1 or the key equal to the current value of cur incremented by 1, the value of cur remains either the third element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the third element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, and the number of test cases in stdin remains multiple minus three.
