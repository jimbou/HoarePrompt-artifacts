Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, cur is equal to num, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 2 if cur is -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 1 if cur is not -1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of T remains greater than 0, and the value of _ remains 0. The value of S remains an integer. The list N remains a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by two. The value of cur is updated to be equal to num. The dictionary M is updated such that if cur is -1, the value of key -1 is 2, otherwise, the value of key -1 is 1 and the value of key cur is 1 if cur is not -1.
