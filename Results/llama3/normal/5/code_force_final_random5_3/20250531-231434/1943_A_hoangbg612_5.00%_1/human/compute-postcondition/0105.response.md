Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N, cur is the last element in the original list N, and the value of cur is being printed, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list N is empty, the dictionary M contains the correct counts of each integer in the original list N, the variable cur holds the last element of the original list N, and the value of cur is being printed. The other variables T, _, S, and stdin remain unchanged.
