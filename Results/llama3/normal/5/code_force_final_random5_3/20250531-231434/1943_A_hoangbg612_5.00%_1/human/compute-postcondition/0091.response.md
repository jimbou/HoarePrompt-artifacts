Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list `N` plus one, and key equal to each integer `i` in the list `N` that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times `i` appears in the list `N`, `cur` is -1, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer, `num` is the first element in the list `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1, since `cur` is -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `M[cur]` is now equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list `N` plus one. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
