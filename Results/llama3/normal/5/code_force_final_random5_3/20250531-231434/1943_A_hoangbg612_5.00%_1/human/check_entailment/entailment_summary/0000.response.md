Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of a single integer `n` followed by `n` integers.
2.  It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array.
3.  It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the sorted array using a dictionary `M`.
4.  The program finds the smallest integer `i` such that the count of `i` is less than or equal to `i`. This is because Alice wants to maximize the score, and she can do so by choosing the smallest integer that is not already in her array `c`.
5.  If no such integer `i` is found, the program returns the last integer in the sorted list plus 1. This is because if all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the array, then the MEX is `n`.
6.  The program prints the result for each test case, which is the final score of the game if both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
