To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `cur`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cur`. If `cur` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list `N`, and key equal to each integer `i` in the original list `N` that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `N`, `cur` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
