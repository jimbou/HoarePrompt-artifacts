Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is equal to num, and M[cur] is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, and then sets the value of `M[cur]` to 1. This means that the value of `cur` is updated to be equal to `num`, and the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M` is reset to 1. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.
