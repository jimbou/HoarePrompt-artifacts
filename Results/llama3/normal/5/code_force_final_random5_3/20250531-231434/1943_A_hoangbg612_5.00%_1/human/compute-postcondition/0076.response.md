To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(cur):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `cur`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cur`. If `cur` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is either 0 or greater than 0. If `cur` is 0, the loop will not execute again. If `cur` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again.

Since `i` is the loop variable, its value will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list `N`, and key equal to each integer `i` in the list `N` that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times `i` appears in the list `N`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is 0 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1.**
