Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N plus one if cur is -1, or key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N plus one if cur is equal to i, cur is either the second element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the second element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1. This means that if cur is -1, the count of -1 in the dictionary M has been increased by 1. If cur is equal to some integer i in the list N, the count of i in the dictionary M has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
