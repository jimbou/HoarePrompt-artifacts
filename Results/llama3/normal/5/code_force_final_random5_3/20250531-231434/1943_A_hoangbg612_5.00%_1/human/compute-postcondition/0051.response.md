Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N plus 1, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is -1, num is the first element in the list N, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. Additionally, the first element in the list N (num) is less than or equal to cur (-1).**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1, where cur is -1. This means that the count of -1 in the dictionary M has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the variables also remain the same.
