Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If num is greater than cur, cur is updated to num, and M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 1. If num is not greater than cur, cur remains equal to the second integer in the list N if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1. M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 2 if cur is -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 2 if cur is not -1. If cur is equal to the second integer in the list N and greater than -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 3. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 2.***
