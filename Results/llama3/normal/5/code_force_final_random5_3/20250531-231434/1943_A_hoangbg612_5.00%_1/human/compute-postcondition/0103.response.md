Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list `N` plus one if `cur` is -1, and key equal to each integer `i` in the list `N` that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times `i` appears in the list `N` plus one if `cur` is `i`, `cur` is either -1 or the first element in the list `N`, and the value of `cur` is being printed, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer, `num` is the third element in the list `N`.**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1, which means that the count of the current value `cur` in the dictionary `M` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cur` is still being printed, and the stdin still contains 1 less input: an integer. The list `N` and the dictionary `M` still have the same properties as before, but the count of `cur` in `M` has been updated.
