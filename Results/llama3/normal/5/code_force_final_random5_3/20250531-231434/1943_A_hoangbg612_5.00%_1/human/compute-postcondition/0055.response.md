Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, if num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is either the second element in the list N plus one if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the second element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, otherwise, cur remains the same as the second element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the second element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.***
