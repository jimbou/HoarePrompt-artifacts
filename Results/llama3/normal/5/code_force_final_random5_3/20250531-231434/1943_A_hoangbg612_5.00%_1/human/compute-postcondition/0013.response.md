Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, cur is equal to the second integer in the list N plus 1 if the second integer in the list N is greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0 and M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1**

Explanation: The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since `cur` is initially equal to the second integer in the list `N` if it's greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is -1, after the increment, `cur` will be equal to the second integer in the list `N` plus 1 if the second integer in the list `N` is greater than -1, otherwise `cur` will be 0. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
