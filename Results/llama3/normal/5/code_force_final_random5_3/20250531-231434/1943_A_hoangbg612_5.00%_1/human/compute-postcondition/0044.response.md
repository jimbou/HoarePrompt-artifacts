According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N` is a sorted list of integers, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` has at least 1 element and `num` is the first element in the list `N`. 

State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is -1, num is the first element in the list N, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
