Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is either -1 or 0, and the value of cur is being printed, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer, num is the first element in the list N, and the current value of num is greater than the current value of cur. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is updated to 0.***
