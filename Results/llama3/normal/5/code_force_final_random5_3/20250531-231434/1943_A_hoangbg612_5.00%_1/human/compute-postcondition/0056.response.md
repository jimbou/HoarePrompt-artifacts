Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is equal to num, M[cur] is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this final state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`, and the dictionary `M` has been updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `cur` (which is now equal to `num`) and the value is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
