Output State: *T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed, cur is the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the state of all variables remains the same as in the initial state, except for the variable cur. The variable cur is set to the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i. This means that the loop will continue to execute until it finds the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i, and then it will set cur to that value. If no such integer is found, the state of cur remains unchanged.
