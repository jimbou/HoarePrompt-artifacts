The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed  `T` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
