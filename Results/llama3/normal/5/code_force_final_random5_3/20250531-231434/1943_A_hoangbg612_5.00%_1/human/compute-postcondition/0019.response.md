Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, cur is equal to the second integer in the list N plus one if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 1 if cur is not -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 2.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, and the dictionary `M` has been updated accordingly. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
