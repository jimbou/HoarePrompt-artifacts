The code prints the value of `cur`, which is determined based on the values in the dictionary `M`.

Since `N` is an empty list, `M` will only have one key-value pair: `-1` with a value of 0 (because -1 does not appear in the original list `N`).

The condition `M[i] <= i` will not be met for any integer `i` in `N`, because `N` is empty. Therefore, `cur` will be equal to the last element in the original list `N` plus 1. However, since `N` is empty, there is no last element, and `cur` will be equal to 1 (because the last element plus 1 is undefined, and the default value is 1).

Output: **1**
