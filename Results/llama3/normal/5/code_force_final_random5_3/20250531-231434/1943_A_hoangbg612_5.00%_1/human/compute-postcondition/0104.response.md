Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer, num is the third element in the list N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is the third element in the list N and M[cur] is 1. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N plus one if cur is -1, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N plus one if cur is i, and the value of cur is being printed.***
