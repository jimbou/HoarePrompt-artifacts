To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `cur`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 (since it's the first iteration), and `cur` is greater than 0.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The state of `cur` remains the same, as it's not dependent on the loop iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list `N`, and key equal to each integer `i` in the original list `N` that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times `i` appears in the original list `N`. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `cur` is not changed, `cur` must be greater than 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i`. `i` is 1**
