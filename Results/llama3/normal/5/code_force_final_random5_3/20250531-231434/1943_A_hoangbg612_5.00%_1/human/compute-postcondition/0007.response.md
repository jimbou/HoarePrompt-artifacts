Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, num is the first integer in the list N, and the current value of num is greater than the current value of cur. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
