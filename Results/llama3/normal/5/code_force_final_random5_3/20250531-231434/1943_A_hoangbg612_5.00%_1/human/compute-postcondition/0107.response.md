Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N, cur is the last element in the original list N plus 1, and the value of cur is being printed, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer. The sum of the values in dictionary M equals S.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still greater than 2, the value of _ is still 2, S is still an integer, N is still an empty list, M is still a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N, cur is now the last element in the original list N plus 1, and the value of cur is being printed, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer. The sum of the values in dictionary M equals S.
