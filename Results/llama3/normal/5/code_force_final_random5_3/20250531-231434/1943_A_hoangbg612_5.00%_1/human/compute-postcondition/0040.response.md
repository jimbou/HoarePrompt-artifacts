The code prints the value of `cur`, which is determined by the loop that iterates over the range of `cur`. The loop checks if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If it is, then `cur` is set to `i`. If not, then the state of `cur` remains unchanged. The loop continues until it finds the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i]` is greater than `i`, or until it reaches the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise it reaches 0.

Since the exact values of `M` and `N` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cur`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `cur` which is either the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i]` is greater than `i`, or the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise it is 0.

Output: **cur (where cur is either the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i, or the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise it is 0)**
