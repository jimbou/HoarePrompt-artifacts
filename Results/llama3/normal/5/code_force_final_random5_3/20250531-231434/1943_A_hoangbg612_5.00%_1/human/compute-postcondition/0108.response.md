Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, cur is the last element in the original list N plus 1 and the value of cur is being printed. In any case, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer.***
