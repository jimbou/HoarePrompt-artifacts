Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N, cur is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, which is 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The state of `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, `stdin`, and `M` remains unchanged. The value of `cur` is updated to 1.
