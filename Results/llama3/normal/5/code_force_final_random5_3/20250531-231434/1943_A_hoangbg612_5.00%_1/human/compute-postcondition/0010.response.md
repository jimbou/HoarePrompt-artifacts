Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `num` is the first integer in the list `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to -1.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include a key-value pair where the key is -1 and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
