Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, if the difference between the current value of num and cur is greater than 1, then cur is updated to 0. In any case, the current value of num is the first element in the list N and is greater than cur, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.***
