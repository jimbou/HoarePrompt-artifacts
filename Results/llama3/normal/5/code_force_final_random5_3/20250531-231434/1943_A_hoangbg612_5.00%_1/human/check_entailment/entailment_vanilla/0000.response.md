Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T` and then iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
4. The program then initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will keep track of the current MEX value.
5. A dictionary `M` is created to store the frequency of each number in the array `a`.
6. The program then iterates over the sorted array `a`. For each number `num`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur`. If it is, and `num` is not equal to `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX value cannot be greater than the current value `cur`.
7. If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the frequency of `num` in the dictionary `M`.
8. After iterating over the entire array `a`, the program checks if the sum of the frequencies of all numbers in `M` is equal to the size of the array `n`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.
9. The program then iterates over the range of `cur` and checks if the frequency of each number `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If it is, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.
10. Finally, the program prints the value of `cur`, which is the final score of the game.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem. Therefore,

Correctness: **True**
