Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is 1, and i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to 1, and the value of `i` has also been updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `M` still contains the same keys and values as before, and the list `N` remains sorted. The value of `S` is still an integer, and the value of `T` is still greater than 1. The value of `_` is still 1.
