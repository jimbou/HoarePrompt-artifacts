Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the first integer in the list N is greater than -1, then cur is equal to the first integer in the list N and M[cur] is 1. Otherwise, cur is -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and the first integer in the list N is less than or equal to -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If num is greater than cur, cur is updated to num and M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and key cur and value 1. If num is not greater than cur, cur remains equal to the second integer in the list N if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1. M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 2 if cur is -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If num is greater than cur, cur is updated to num, and M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 1. If num is not greater than cur, cur remains equal to the second integer in the list N if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1. M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 2 if cur is -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 2 if cur is not -1. If cur is equal to the second integer in the list N and greater than -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 3. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
