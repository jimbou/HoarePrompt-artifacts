Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It processes each test case by sorting the integers, counting the occurrences of each integer, and then finding the smallest integer i such that the count of i is less than or equal to i. If no such integer is found, it returns the last integer in the sorted list plus 1. The function prints the result for each test case and consumes all input from standard input.**
