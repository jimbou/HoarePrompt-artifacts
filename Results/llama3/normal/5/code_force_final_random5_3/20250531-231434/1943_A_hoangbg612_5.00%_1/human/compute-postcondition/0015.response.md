Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, cur is equal to num, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and key cur and value 1.**

The code assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, and then adds an entry to the dictionary `M` with the key `cur` and value 1. The initial state of `M` had a key -1 and value 1, which remains unchanged. The values of `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and stdin are not affected by the code.
