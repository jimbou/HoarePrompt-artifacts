To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the second element in the list `N`, and `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` must be the third element in the list `N`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list `N`, and key equal to each integer `i` in the list `N` that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times `i` appears in the list `N`, `cur` is either -1 or the first element in the list `N`, and the value of `cur` is being printed, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer, `num` is the third element in the list `N`.**
