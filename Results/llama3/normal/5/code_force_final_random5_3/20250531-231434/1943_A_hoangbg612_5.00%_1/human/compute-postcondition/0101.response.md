Postcondition: ***T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is either 0 or the second element in the list N, and the value of cur is being printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. stdin contains 1 less input: an integer, and num is the third element in the list N.***
