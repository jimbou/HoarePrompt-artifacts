The only object in the loop head is variable num and list N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, N has at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the num is the third integer in the list.
State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If num is greater than cur, cur is updated to num and M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and key cur and value 1. If num is not greater than cur, cur remains equal to the second integer in the list N if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1. M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 2 if cur is -1, otherwise M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key cur and value 2.**
