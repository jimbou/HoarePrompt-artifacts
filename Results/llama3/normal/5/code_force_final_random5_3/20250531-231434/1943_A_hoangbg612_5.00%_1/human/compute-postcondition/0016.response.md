Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `cur` is equal to the second integer in the list `N` if it's greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is -1 and `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value 2 if `cur` is -1, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1 and key `cur` and value 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1. If `cur` is -1, then the value of `M[-1]` is now 2. Otherwise, if `cur` is equal to the second integer in the list `N`, then the value of `M[cur]` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
