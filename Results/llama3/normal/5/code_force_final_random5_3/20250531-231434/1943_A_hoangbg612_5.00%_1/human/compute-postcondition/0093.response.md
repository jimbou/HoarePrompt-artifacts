The only object in the loop head is variable  num and list N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, N has at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list N. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the num is the second element in the list.
State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list `N`, and key equal to each integer `i` in the list `N` that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times `i` appears in the list `N`, `cur` is either -1 or the first element in the list `N`, and the value of `cur` is being printed, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer, `num` is the second element in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, the count of -1 in dictionary `M` is incremented by 1.**
