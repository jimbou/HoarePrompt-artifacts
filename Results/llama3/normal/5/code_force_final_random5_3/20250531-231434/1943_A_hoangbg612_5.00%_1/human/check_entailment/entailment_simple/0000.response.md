Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
3. It sorts the array `N` in ascending order.
4. It initializes a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in the array.
5. It iterates over the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M` accordingly. If a number is greater than the current maximum `cur`, it increments `cur` and breaks the loop. If a number is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the count of that number in `M`.
6. After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to the size of the array `S`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.
7. It then iterates over the range of `cur` and checks if the count of each number in `M` is less than or equal to the number itself. If it finds such a number, it sets `cur` to that number and breaks the loop.
8. Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the array.

The program correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score. The use of the dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number is efficient, and the loop breaks when the maximum `cur` is found, which reduces the number of iterations.

Correctness: **True**
