To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `cur`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `cur` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `cur` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N, if the value of M[i] is less than or equal to the value of i, then cur is 0, otherwise cur is at least 1, and i is 1**
