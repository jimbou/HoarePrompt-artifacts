To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `num` and the list `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `num` is the first integer in the list `N`**
