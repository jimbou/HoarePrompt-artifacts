Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX of the array c.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first sorts the input array N in ascending order.
2. It then iterates through the sorted array, keeping track of the current maximum value (cur) and a dictionary (M) to store the count of each number.
3. If a number is greater than the current maximum value (cur), it checks if the difference between the number and cur is more than 1. If it is, it breaks the loop and increments cur by 1. This is because Alice can choose the number that is more than 1 greater than cur, which will increase the MEX.
4. If the number is not greater than cur, it increments the count of the current number in the dictionary M.
5. After iterating through the entire array, it checks if the sum of the counts in the dictionary M is equal to the length of the input array S. If it is, it increments cur by 1. This is because if all numbers are used, the MEX will be one more than the maximum value.
6. Finally, it iterates through the range of cur and checks if the count of each number in the dictionary M is less than or equal to the number itself. If it finds such a number, it sets cur to that number and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX will be the smallest number that is not used or is used less than its value.

The program correctly implements the game strategy and should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
