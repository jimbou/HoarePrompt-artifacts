Postcondition: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is the last element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the last element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of elements in the list N. The sum of the values in the dictionary M equals S.**
