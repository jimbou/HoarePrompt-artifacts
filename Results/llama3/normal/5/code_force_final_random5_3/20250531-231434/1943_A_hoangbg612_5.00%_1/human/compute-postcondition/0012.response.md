To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for num in N:`, which means we're iterating over the list `N`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:

* `T` is greater than 0
* `_` is 0
* `S` is an integer
* `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two
* If the first integer in the list `N` is greater than -1, then `cur` is equal to the first integer in the list `N` and `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and the first integer in the list `N` is less than or equal to -1.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when we move to the next element in the list `N`. The only variable that changes is `num`, which will take on the value of the next element in the list.

Since `N` is a sorted list, the next element will be the second element in the list (assuming the list has at least two elements). Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

* `T` remains greater than 0 (no change)
* `_` remains 0 (no change)
* `S` remains an integer (no change)
* `N` remains a sorted list of integers, but we know it has at least two elements now
* `stdin` remains unchanged (no change)
* If the second integer in the list `N` is greater than -1, then `cur` is equal to the second integer in the list `N` and `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and the second integer in the list `N` is less than or equal to -1.

Note that we don't know the exact value of the second integer in the list `N`, so we can't determine the exact value of `cur` or `M[cur]`. However, we can express the state in terms of the second integer in the list `N`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `cur` is equal to the second integer in the list `N` if it's greater than -1, otherwise `cur` is -1 and `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1**
