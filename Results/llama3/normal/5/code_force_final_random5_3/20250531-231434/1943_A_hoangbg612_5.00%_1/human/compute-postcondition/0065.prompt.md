Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is either the first element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the first element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is either the second element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the second element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If num is greater than cur, then cur is updated to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of M[cur] is incremented by 1 if cur is -1, or the value of M[i] is incremented by 1 if cur is equal to i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is either the third element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the third element in the list N is less than or equal to -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If num is greater than cur, then cur is updated to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of M[cur] is incremented by 1 if cur is -1, or the value of M[i] is incremented by 1 if cur is equal to i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
