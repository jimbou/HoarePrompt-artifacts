Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N, cur is at least 2 and i is 2.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `cur = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, and the second line breaks out of the loop or control structure it is part of. 

Since `i` is at least 2, `cur` becomes at least 2. The value of `i` is 2. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
