Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, if num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is equal to the second integer in the list N plus 1 if the second integer in the list N is greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. In all cases, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1***
