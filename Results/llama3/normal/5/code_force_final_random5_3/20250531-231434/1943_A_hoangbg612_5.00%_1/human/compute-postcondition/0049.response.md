Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is the first element in the list N and is greater than 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

Explanation: The first line assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Since `num` is the first element in the list `N` and is greater than `cur`, `cur` becomes the first element in the list `N`. The second line increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Since `cur` is now the first element in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected.
