Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list `N`, and key equal to each integer `i` in the list `N` that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times `i` appears in the list `N` plus 1 for the key `cur`, `cur` is either -1 or the first element in the list `N`, and the value of `cur` is being printed, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer, `num` is the second element in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, the count of -1 in dictionary `M` is incremented by 1, and the count of `cur` in dictionary `M` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the count of `cur` in dictionary `M` is incremented by 1. This means that the number of times `cur` appears in the list `N` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
