Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the first integer in the list N is greater than -1, then cur is equal to the first integer in the list N and M[cur] is 1. Otherwise, cur is -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value 1, and the first integer in the list N is less than or equal to -1.***
