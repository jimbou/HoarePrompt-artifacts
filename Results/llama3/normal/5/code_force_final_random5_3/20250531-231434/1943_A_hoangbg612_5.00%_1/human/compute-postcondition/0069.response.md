The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and cur, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur`. If cur is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is the last element in the list N if it is greater than 0, or -1 if the last element in the list N is less than or equal to -1. If the sum of the values in the dictionary M equals S, then cur is increased by 1. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of elements in the list N does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `cur` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is greater than 0, i is 0**
