Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, cur is -1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of _ also remains the same. The value of S is updated to an integer value read from the input. The list N is updated to a sorted list of integers read from the input. The dictionary M is updated to store the frequency of each integer in the list N, including -1. The variable cur is initialized to -1. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, as two inputs have been read.
