The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and cur, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cur`. If `i` is less than `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `cur` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `cur` must be greater than 1.
State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed, cur must be greater than 1. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is set to i. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed, i is 1**
