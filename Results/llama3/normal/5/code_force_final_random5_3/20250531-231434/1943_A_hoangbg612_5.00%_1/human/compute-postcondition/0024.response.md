Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, cur is the last integer in the original list N if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is -1, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The variables T, _, and S remain unchanged, with T being greater than 0, _ being 0, and S being an integer.
* The list N is empty, indicating that all elements have been processed.
* The variable cur is updated to the last integer in the original list N if it's greater than -1, otherwise it remains -1.
* The dictionary M contains keys for each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1, with the value being the number of times i appears in the original list N. Additionally, if -1 appears in the original list N, M contains a key -1 with a value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N.
