Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    for i in range(cur):
        if M[i] <= i:
            cur = i
            break
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 0, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. Otherwise, the state of cur is not changed, cur is the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i, or cur is equal to the last integer in the original list N plus 1 if it's greater than -1, otherwise cur is 0. and cur is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is greater than 1, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the list N, and key equal to each integer i in the list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the list N, and cur is the smallest integer i such that M[i] is greater than i, or -1 if no such integer exists, and the value of cur is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is greater than 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value equal to the number of times -1 appears in the original list N, and key equal to each integer i in the original list N that is greater than -1 and value equal to the number of times i appears in the original list N. If the value of M[i] is less than or equal to the value of i, then cur is equal to the smallest integer i such that M[i] is less than or equal to i, otherwise cur is equal to the last element in the original list N plus 1, and cur is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
