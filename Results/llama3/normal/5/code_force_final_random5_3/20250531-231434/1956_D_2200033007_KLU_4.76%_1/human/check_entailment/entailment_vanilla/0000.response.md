Reasoning:

The given program is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array is 2 and when the length of the array is 3 (with a specific set of values). It does not provide a general solution for arrays of any length.
2. The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array as an argument, but it does not use this information to calculate the maximum sum or generate the sequence of operations.
3. The program does not read the input array correctly. It reads the entire line of input as a string, splits it into substrings using the `split` method, and then appends these substrings to the array `a`. However, it does not convert these substrings to integers, so the array `a` contains strings, not integers.
4. The program does not calculate the maximum sum of the array elements or generate the sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to:

* Read the input array correctly, converting the input strings to integers.
* Calculate the maximum sum of the array elements using a dynamic programming approach or other algorithm.
* Generate the sequence of operations to achieve this sum, using the MEX operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
