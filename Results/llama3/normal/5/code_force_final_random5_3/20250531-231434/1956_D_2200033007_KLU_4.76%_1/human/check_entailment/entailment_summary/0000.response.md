Reasoning: 

The given program is not correct. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the input list is 2, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2", and when the length of the input list is not 2, it prints "13 0". However, the problem requires the program to find the maximum sum of the elements of the array and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum for any input array of length up to 18.

The program does not perform any calculations or operations on the input array, and it does not generate a sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. It simply prints a hardcoded message based on the length of the input list.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem, and its correctness is False.

Correctness: **False**
