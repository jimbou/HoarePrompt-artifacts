Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the input list `c` is 2, and it prints a fixed output for this case. However, the problem statement requires the program to handle lists of length up to 18 and to find the maximum sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing a sequence of operations.

The program does not attempt to solve the problem for lists of length greater than 2, and it does not perform any operations on the input list `a`. The variable `m` is initialized to 0 but is not used anywhere in the program.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
