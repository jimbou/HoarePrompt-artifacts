Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program only handles two specific cases: when the input list has exactly 2 integers and when it doesn't. In the case where the list has exactly 2 integers, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2", which is correct for the specific example given in the problem description, but it does not provide a general solution for all possible inputs. In the case where the list does not have exactly 2 integers, it prints "13 0", which is also not a general solution and does not provide the correct maximum sum for all possible inputs.

The program does not attempt to find the maximum sum of the elements of the array or construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum, as required by the problem description. It simply prints a hardcoded message based on the length of the input list.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
