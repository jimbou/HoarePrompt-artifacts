Output State: **`c` is a list of n integers, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, and each integer in the list is non-negative and less than or equal to 10^7, `m` is 0.**

In this output state, the list `c` remains unchanged, with the same number of elements `n` and the same range of values for each integer. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `m`, which is assigned the value 0.
