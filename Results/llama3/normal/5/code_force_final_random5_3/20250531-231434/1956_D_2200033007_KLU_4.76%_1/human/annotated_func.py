#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of n integers, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, and each integer in the list is non-negative and less than or equal to 10^7.
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: *`c` is a list of n integers, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, and each integer in the list is non-negative and less than or equal to 10^7, `m` is 0. If `c` is a list of 2 integers, then "1 2" is printed. Otherwise, "13 0" is printed.
    return
    #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of m remains 0, and the list c remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and prints a specific message based on the length of the list. If the list has exactly 2 integers, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2". Otherwise, it prints "13 0". The function does not modify the input list or return any value. It only prints a message to the console and maintains the original state of the input list and variables.
