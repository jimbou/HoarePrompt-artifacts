Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners. The key insight is that the side length of the square is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) of the corners. The program correctly calculates this difference and squares it to get the area.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* Squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes
* Squares with positive area (strictly greater than 0)
* Squares with corners in random order
* Squares with coordinates in the range -1000 to 1000

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the mathematical concept of calculating the area of a square given its corner coordinates. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
