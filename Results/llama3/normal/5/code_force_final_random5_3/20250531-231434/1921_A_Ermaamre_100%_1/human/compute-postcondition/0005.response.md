To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to be greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer greater than 1.

The other variables, `a`, `x`, and `dx`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers, `x` is a list of 4 integers, `dx` is an integer**
