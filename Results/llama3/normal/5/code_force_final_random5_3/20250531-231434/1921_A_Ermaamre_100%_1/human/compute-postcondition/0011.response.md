The code prints the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. The value of `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. The square of `dx` is calculated by multiplying `dx` by itself.

Output: **dx^2 (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
