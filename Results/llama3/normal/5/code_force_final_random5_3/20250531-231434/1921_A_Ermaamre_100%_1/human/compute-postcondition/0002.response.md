Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, _ is 0, a is a 4x4 matrix of integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer**

The code first reads 4 lines of input from stdin, each containing a list of integers, and stores them in the 2D list `a`. This means that `t` testcases have been consumed from stdin, leaving `t-4` testcases remaining. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.

The code then creates a new list `x` by extracting the first element of each sublist in `a`. This means that `x` now contains 4 integers.

Finally, the code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` and stores it in `dx`. This means that `dx` is an integer representing the range of values in `x`.

Note that the value of `t` is not modified by the code, so it remains an integer between 1 and 100. The value of `_` is also not modified, so it remains 0.
