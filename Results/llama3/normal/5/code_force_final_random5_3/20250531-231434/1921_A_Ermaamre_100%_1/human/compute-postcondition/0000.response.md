The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t testcases. Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of the square. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t testcases. Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of the square.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t testcases. Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of the square.**
