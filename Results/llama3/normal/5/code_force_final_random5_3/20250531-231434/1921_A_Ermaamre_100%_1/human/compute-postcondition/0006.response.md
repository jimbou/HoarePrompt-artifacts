Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, a is a 4x4 matrix of integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x.**

The code first reassigns the value of `a` to a new 4x4 matrix of integers, which is read from the input. The previous value of `a` is lost. Then, it reassigns the value of `x` to a list of the first elements of each row in the new matrix `a`. The previous value of `x` is lost. Finally, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the new list `x` and assigns this difference to `dx`. The previous value of `dx` is lost. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
