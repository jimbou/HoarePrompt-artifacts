This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (dx) and prints the square of dx. The function repeats this process t times, effectively calculating and printing the area of each square defined by the input coordinates.
