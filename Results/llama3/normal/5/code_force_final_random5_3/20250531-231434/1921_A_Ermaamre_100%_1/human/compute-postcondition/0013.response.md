Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, _ is t-1, a is a 4x4 matrix of integers, x is a list of 4 integers, dx is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in x, and the square of dx is printed.**

This output state means that the loop has executed for all the test cases (t) and has printed the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the corners of the square for each test case. The loop variable _ has reached its final value, which is t-1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables a, x, and dx still hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
