Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square, which are guaranteed to be in random order.
3. The program correctly calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`), which represents the length of one side of the square.
4. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the length of one side is sufficient to calculate the area of the square.
5. The program correctly prints the square of `dx`, which is the area of the square.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading the input, calculating the area, and printing the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
