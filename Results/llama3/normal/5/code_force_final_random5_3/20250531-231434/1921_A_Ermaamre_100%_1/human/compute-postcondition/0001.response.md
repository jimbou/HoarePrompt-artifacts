The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and stdin contains `t` testcases. So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t` testcases, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
