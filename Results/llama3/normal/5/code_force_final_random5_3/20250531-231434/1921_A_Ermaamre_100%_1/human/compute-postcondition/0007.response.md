Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `dx` is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.
* Since `x` is a list of 4 integers, the maximum and minimum values in `x` can be any integer values.
* The difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` is calculated as `dx = max(x) - min(x)`.
* The print statement `print(dx * dx)` calculates the square of `dx`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Output: **(max(x) - min(x))^2 (where max(x) and min(x) are the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
