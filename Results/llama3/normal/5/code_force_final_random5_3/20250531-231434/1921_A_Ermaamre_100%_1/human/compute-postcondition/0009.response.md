To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to remain greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` is 2, and `t` is an integer greater than 2.

The other variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers, `x` is a list of 4 integers, `dx` is an integer equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`**
