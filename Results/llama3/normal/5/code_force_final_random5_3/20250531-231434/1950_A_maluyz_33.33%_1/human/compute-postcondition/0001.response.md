The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
