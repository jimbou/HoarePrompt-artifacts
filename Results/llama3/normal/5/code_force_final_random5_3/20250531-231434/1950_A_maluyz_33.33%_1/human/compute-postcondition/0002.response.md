Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of the three digits from the first line of the input, which are integers between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits, since one line has been read and processed.
