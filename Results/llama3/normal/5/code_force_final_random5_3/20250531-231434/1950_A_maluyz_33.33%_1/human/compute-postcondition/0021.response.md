Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, and are the values of the three digits in the next line of stdin, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, 'NONE' is printed. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, then if the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `i` is still 1, and `a`, `b`, `c` are now assigned the values of the three digits in the next line of stdin. The remaining `t-2` lines in stdin still contain three digits each. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'NONE', or 'PEAK' remain the same based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
