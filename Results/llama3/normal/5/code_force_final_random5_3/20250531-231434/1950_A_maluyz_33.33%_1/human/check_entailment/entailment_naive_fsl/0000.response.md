Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly identify the "PEAK" condition. According to the problem description, a peak satisfies the condition a<b>c. However, the program checks if the maximum of a, b, and c is equal to b, which is not the correct condition for a peak. 

For example, if the input is 1 3 2, the program will print "NONE" instead of "PEAK". This is because the program checks if the maximum of 1, 3, and 2 is equal to 3, which is not true. However, the condition a<b>c is satisfied, so the correct output should be "PEAK".
