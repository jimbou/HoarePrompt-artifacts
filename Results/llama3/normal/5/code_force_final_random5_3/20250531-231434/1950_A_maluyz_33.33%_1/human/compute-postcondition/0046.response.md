Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains no lines. `i` is equal to `t`. `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, and are the values of the three digits in the last line of stdin. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, 'NONE' is printed. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, then if the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1000, but the input stream (stdin) will be empty since all lines have been processed. The loop counter `i` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values of the three digits from the last line of the input stream. The output will be determined based on the conditions specified in the loop body, resulting in either 'STAIR', 'NONE', or 'PEAK' being printed, depending on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c`.
