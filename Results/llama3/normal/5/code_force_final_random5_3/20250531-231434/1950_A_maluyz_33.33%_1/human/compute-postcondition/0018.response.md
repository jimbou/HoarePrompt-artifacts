Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9. Either `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`. stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, 'NONE' is printed. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, then if the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
