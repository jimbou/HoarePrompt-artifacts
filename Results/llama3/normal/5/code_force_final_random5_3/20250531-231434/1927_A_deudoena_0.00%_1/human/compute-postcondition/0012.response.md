According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `inpstr`. If `inpstr` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `inpstr` is a string that must have at least n characters, so it needs to be adjusted to `inpstr` has at least 1 character and `i` is now 0.

State: **`inpstr` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is 0, `j` is the last character in the string, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `j` is 'B', then `ind1` is n-1 and `ind2` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `ind1` and `ind2` are not changed.**
