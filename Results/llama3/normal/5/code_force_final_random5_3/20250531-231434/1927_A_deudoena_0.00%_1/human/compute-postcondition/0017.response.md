Output State: **inpstr is a string that must have at least 2 characters, i is 1, j is the second last character in the string, ind2 is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last character of inpstr is 'B', then ind1 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 are not changed.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `ind2`, making `ind2` equal to 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The values of `inpstr`, `i`, `j`, and `ind1` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing `t-1` test cases.
