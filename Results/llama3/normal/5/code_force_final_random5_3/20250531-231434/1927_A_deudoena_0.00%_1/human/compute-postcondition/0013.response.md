Postcondition: ***`inpstr` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is 0, `j` is the last character in the string, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. The current value of `inpstr[-i - 1]` is 'B'. If `j` is 'B', then `ind1` is n-1 and `ind2` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `ind1` and `ind2` are not changed.***
