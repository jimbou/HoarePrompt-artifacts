The code prints the length of the string `inpstr` minus the sum of `ind2` and `ind1`. 

The length of `inpstr` is at least `n` characters. 

The value of `ind2` depends on the last character of `inpstr`. If the last character is 'B', then `ind2` is `n-1`. Otherwise, the value of `ind2` is not changed. 

The value of `ind1` also depends on the last character of `inpstr`. If the last character is 'B', then `ind1` is `0`. Otherwise, the value of `ind1` is not changed.

Output: **the length of inpstr minus the sum of ind2 and ind1 (where the length of inpstr is at least n characters, ind2 is n-1 if the last character of inpstr is 'B' otherwise its value is not changed, and ind1 is 0 if the last character of inpstr is 'B' otherwise its value is not changed)**
