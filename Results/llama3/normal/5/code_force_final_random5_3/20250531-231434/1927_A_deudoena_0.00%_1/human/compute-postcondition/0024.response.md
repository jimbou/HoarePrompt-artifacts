Output: **inpstr is a string that must have at least n characters, i is n-1, j is the last character in the string, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last character of inpstr is 'B', then ind2 is n-1 and ind1 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 and ind2 are not changed, and the length of inpstr minus ind2 minus ind1 is printed.**
