Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: inpstr is a string that must have at least n characters, j is the last character in the string, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If j is 'B', then ind1 is n-1 and ind2 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 and ind2 are not changed.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: inpstr is a string that must have at least n characters, i is n-1, j is the last character in the string, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last character of inpstr is 'B', then ind2 is n-1 and ind1 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 and ind2 are not changed.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: the length of inpstr minus the sum of ind2 and ind1 (where the length of inpstr is at least n characters, ind2 is n-1 if the last character of inpstr is 'B' otherwise its value is not changed, and ind1 is 0 if the last character of inpstr is 'B' otherwise its value is not changed)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters. It then finds the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string and prints the length of the string minus the sum of the indices of these two 'B's. If 'B' is not found at the start or end of the string, it uses the index of the first or last 'B' found, respectively. The function does not modify the input string or any external state, and its output is solely based on the input provided.
