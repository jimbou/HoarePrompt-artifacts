Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. inpstr is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i, j in enumerate(inpstr):
    if j == 'B':
        ind1 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, inpstr is a string that must have at least 1 character, j is the first character in the string, i is 0, ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0. If j is 'B', then the state of the variables remains the same. Otherwise, the state of the variables is not specified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *inpstr is a string that must have at least 2 characters, j is the second character in the string, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If j is 'B', then ind1 is 1 and ind2 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 and ind2 are not changed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *inpstr is a string that must have at least 3 characters, j is the third character in the string, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If j is 'B', then ind1 is 2 and ind2 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 and ind2 are not changed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
