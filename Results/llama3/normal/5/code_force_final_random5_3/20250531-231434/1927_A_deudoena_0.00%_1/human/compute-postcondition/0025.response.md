Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters. It then finds the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string and prints the length of the string minus the sum of the indices of these two 'B's. If 'B' is not found at the start or end of the string, it uses the index of the first or last 'B' found, respectively. The function does not modify the input string or any external state, and its output is solely based on the input provided.**
