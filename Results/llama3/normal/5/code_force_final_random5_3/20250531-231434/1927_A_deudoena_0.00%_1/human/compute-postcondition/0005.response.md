The only objects in the loop head are variables  i, j and string  inpstr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the inpstr.  If the string has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, inpstr has at least 1 character, j is the first character in the string, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 2 characters and the index is 1 and j is the second character in the string.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, inpstr is a string that must have at least 2 characters, j is the second character in the string, i is 1, ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0**
