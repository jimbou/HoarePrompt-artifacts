You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: inpstr is a string that must have at least n characters, j is the last character in the string, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If j is 'B', then ind1 is n-1 and ind2 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 and ind2 are not changed.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: inpstr is a string that must have at least n characters, i is n-1, j is the last character in the string, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last character of inpstr is 'B', then ind2 is n-1 and ind1 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 and ind2 are not changed.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: the length of inpstr minus the sum of ind2 and ind1 (where the length of inpstr is at least n characters, ind2 is n-1 if the last character of inpstr is 'B' otherwise its value is not changed, and ind1 is 0 if the last character of inpstr is 'B' otherwise its value is not changed)

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
