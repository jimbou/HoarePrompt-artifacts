The only objects in the loop head are variables  i, j and string inpstr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the inpstr.  If the string has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains t-1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the string must have at least 1 character and the i is 0 and j is the first character in the string.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, inpstr is a string that must have at least 1 character, j is the first character in the string, i is 0, ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0**
