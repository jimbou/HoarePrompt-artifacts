The only objects in the loop head are variables  i, j and string  inpstr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the inpstr.  If the string has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, inpstr has at least 2 characters, j is the second character in the string, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 3 characters and the i is 2 and j is the third character in the string.
State: **inpstr is a string that must have at least 3 characters, j is the third character in the string, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If j is 'B', then ind1 is 1 and ind2 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 and ind2 are not changed.**
