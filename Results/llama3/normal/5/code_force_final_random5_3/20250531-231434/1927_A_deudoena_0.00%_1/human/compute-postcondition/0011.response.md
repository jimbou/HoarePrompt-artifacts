Output State: **inpstr is a string that must have at least n characters, j is the last character in the string, i is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If j is 'B', then ind1 is n-1 and ind2 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 and ind2 are not changed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the input string `inpstr` has been fully processed, and the last character `j` has been checked. The loop counter `i` has reached the last index of the string (`n-1`). The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-1` test cases. If the last character `j` is 'B', then `ind1` is updated to the last index (`n-1`) and `ind2` remains 0. If `j` is not 'B', the values of `ind1` and `ind2` are not changed.
