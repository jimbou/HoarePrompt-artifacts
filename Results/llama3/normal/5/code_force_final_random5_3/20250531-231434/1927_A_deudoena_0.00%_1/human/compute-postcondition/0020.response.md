Output State: **inpstr is a string that must have at least 3 characters, i is 2, j is the second last character in the string, ind2 is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last character of inpstr is 'B', then ind1 is 0. Otherwise, the values of ind1 are not changed.**

Explanation: The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ind2`, making `ind2` equal to 2. The second line is a break statement, which does not affect any variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
