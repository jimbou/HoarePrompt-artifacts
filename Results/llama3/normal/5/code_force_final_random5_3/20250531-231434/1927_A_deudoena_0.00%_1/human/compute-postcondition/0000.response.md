Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. inpstr is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0.**

Explanation:
The first line reads an integer t from stdin and assigns it to inpstr. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The second, third, and fourth lines initialize variables ind1, ind2, and outind to 0, respectively. These variables are new and do not affect the existing state of stdin or any other variables.
