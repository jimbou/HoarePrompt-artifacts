Output State: **inpstr is a string that must have at least 2 characters, j is the second character in the string, i is 1, ind1 is 1, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `ind1`, making `ind1` equal to 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
