The code `P += 1` increments the value of `P` by 1. Since the initial state has `P` as 0, the new value of `P` will be 1.

The other variables `i`, `s`, `e`, `M`, and the stdin are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character and the first character in the string `e` is '+', `P` is 1, `M` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
