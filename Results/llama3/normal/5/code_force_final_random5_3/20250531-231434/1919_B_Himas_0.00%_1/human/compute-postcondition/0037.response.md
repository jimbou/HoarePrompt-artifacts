The code prints the difference between the number of '+' characters (P) and the number of '-' characters (M) in the original string `e`.
Since `e` is an empty string, it does not contain any '+' or '-' characters.
Therefore, the value of `P` is 0 (no '+' characters) and the value of `M` is also 0 (no '-' characters).
Output: **0**
