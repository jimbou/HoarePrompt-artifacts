To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the value returned by `int(input())`, which we'll call `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the number of test cases minus one (since one test case has already been processed).

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is determined by the input and does not change during the loop.

The other variables in the state (`stdin`, `s`, `e`, `P`, and `M`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e` which is 0, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e` which is 0**
