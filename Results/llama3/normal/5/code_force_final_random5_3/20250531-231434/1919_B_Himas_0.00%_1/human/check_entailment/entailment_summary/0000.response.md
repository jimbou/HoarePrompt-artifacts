Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of "+" and "-" characters in the string and printing their difference. This is because the penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the array multiplied by its length, and the sum of the array is equal to the difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the length of the string and the string itself, and then counts the number of "+" and "-" characters. It then prints the difference between these counts, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading multiple test cases, calculating the difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters, and printing the result.

Correctness: **True**
