The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `input()`. If `i` is less than `input()`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `input()` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `input()` must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer, `e` is an empty string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e`, and the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the original string `e` is being printed**
