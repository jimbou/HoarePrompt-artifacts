Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string with at least three characters, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3.**

The code increments the value of `M` by 1. Since `M` was either 0 or 2 depending on the value of `q`, it is now either 1 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
