The value of `P` is incremented by 1. The value of `P` was 0, so the new value of `P` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `q` is still '+', and it is still the first character in the string `e`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `q` is '+' and is the first character in the string `e`.**
