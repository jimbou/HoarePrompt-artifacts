Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string. If the second character of `e` is '+', then `P` is either 1 or 2 and `M` is 1. If the second character of `e` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `P` and `M` based on the second character of `e` have been updated to reflect the new value of `M`.
