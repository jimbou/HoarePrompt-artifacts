To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `input()`. The loop will execute as long as `input()` provides a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0. Since `stdin` contains multiple test cases, we can assume that the first input is available and is an integer.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, `i` is 0, `input()` is an integer greater than 0**
