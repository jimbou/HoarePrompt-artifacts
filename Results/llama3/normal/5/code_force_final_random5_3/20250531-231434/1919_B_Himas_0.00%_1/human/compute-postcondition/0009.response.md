Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `P` is either 1 or 2 and `M` is 0 if the second character of `e` is '+', otherwise `P` is 1 and `M` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If the second character of `e` is '+', then `P` was initially 1 and is now 2, and `M` is still 0. Otherwise, `P` was initially 0 and is now 1, and `M` is still 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
