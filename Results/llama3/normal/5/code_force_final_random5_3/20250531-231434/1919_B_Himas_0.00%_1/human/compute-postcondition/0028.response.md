To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for q in e:`, where `q` is the loop variable and `e` is the iterable.

From the current state, we know that `q` is the first character in the string `e`. To execute the loop again, `q` should be the next character in the string `e`.

Since `e` is a non-empty string, it must have at least two characters. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

* `q` is the second character in the string `e`.
* `e` is still a non-empty string, but now it has at least two characters.
* The other variables (`i`, `s`, `P`, and `M`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
