Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty of each subarray. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the input string. This difference represents the sum of the array. Since the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is not split into subarrays.

In this case, the penalty is simply the absolute value of the sum of the array, which is the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters. Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
