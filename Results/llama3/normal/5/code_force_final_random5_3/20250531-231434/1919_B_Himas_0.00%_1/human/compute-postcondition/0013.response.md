Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string. If the second character of `e` is '+', then `P` is either 2 or 3 and `M` is 0. If the second character of `e` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2. Otherwise, `P` is 2 and `M` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If the second character of `e` is '+', then `P` was either 1 or 2, so now it is either 2 or 3. If the second character of `e` is not '+', then `P` was 0, so now it is 1. Otherwise, `P` was 1, so now it is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
