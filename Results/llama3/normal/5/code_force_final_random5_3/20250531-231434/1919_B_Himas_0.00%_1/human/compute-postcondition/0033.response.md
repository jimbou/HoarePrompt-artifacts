Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string with at least three characters, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 3, and if `q` is not '+', then `P` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
