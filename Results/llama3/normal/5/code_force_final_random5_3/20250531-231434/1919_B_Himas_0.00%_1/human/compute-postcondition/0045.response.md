Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the first character in the string `e`, and `q` is not equal to '+'**

The value of `M` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.
