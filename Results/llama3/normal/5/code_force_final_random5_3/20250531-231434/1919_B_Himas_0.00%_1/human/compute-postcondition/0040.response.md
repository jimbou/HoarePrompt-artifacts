The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `s`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, after this line, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `e`. The third and fourth lines assign 0 to `P` and `M`, respectively.

Output State: **i is 2, s is an integer, e is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, P is 0, M is 0**
