Output State: **i is the number of test cases in stdin minus one, s is an integer, stdin contains no test cases, e is an empty string, P is the number of '+' characters in the original string e, M is the number of '-' characters in the original string e, and the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the original string e is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be one less than the number of test cases in the input, `s` will be an integer (the length of the last string), `stdin` will be empty (no more test cases), `e` will be an empty string (no more characters to process), `P` and `M` will hold the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the last string, and the difference between these counts will be printed.
