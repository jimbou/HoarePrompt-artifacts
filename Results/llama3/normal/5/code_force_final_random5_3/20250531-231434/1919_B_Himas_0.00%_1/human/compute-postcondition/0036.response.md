Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is an empty string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `i`, `s`, and stdin as in the initial state. The string `e` will be empty since the loop iterates over each character in `e`. The values of `P` and `M` will be the total count of '+' and '-' characters in the original string `e`, respectively.
