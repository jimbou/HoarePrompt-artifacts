Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e`.
* `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e`.
* Since `e` is an empty string, it does not contain any '+' or '-' characters. Therefore, `P` and `M` are both 0.

Now, let's evaluate the expression `P - M`:

* `P - M` = 0 - 0 = 0

So, the print statement will output the result of the expression `P - M`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
