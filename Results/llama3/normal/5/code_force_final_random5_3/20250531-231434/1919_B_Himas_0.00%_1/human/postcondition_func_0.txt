The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the length of the string) and a string containing "+" and "-" characters. It then calculates and prints the difference between the number of "+" characters and the number of "-" characters in each string. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.
