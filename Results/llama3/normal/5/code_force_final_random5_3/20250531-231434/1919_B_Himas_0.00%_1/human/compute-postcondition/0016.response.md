Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The string `e` is now empty since the loop has iterated over all its characters. The variables `P` and `M` now hold the total count of '+' and '-' characters, respectively, that were present in the original string `e`.
