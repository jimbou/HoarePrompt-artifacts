Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 0, s is an integer greater than 0, e is a string, P is 0, M is 0**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to s, reducing the number of test cases in stdin by one. The value of s is an integer greater than 0. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to e. The third and fourth lines initialize P and M to 0, respectively. The value of i remains unchanged at 0.
