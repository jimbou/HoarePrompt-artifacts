Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the second character in the string `e`, if `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1, otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `M` is now 1, otherwise, it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
