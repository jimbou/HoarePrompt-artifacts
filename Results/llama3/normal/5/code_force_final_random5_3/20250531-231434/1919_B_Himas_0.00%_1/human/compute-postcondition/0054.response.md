Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `s` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `e` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3.***
