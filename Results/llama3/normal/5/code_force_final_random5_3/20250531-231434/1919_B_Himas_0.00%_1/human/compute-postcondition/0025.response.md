Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `q` is the first character in the string `e`, and `q` is not '+'**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The first character of the string `e` is still `q`, and `q` is still not '+'.
