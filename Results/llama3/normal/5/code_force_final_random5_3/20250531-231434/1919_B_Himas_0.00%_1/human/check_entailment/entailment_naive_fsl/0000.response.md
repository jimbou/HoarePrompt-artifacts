Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string. The penalty is calculated as the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is equivalent to the sum of the penalties of the subarrays.

The program works correctly for all potential cases because it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and calculates the absolute difference, which is a straightforward and correct implementation of the problem description.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to produce an incorrect result. The program handles all possible inputs, including empty strings, strings with only '+' or '-' characters, and strings with a mix of '+' and '-' characters.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
