The only object in the loop head is variable  q and string e, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string e.  If the string has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, e has at least 2 characters, q is the first character in the string. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 2 characters and the q is the second character in the string.
State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string. If the second character of `e` is '+', then `P` is either 1 or 2 and `M` is 0. If the second character of `e` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.**
