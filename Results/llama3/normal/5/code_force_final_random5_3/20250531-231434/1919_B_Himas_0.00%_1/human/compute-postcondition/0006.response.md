Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `q` is the first character in the string `e`, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, the first character of the string `e` is not '+', and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `M` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the input stream and the string `e` are still valid.
