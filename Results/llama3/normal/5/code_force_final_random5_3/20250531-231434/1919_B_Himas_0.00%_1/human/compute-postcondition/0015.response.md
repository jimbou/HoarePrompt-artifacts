Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string. If the second character of `e` is '+', then `P` is either 2 or 3 and `M` is 0. If the second character of `e` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2. Otherwise, `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If the second character of `e` is '+', then `P` is either 1 or 2 and `M` is 1. If the second character of `e` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.***
