Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1 if the second character of `e` is '+', otherwise `P` is 0 and `M` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If the second character of `e` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is now 1. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is now 2. The values of `stdin`, `i`, `s`, and `e` remain unchanged.
