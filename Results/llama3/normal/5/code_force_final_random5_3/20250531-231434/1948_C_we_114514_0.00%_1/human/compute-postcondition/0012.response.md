Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` of `row1` is not '>', the character at index `j` of `row2` is '>', and the current value of `j` is less than `n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer, and we have a list of test cases with at least one test case. The first test case is still stored in the variable `test_case`, and the list of results is still empty. The number of elements `n` is still at least 1. The second and third elements of the first test case are still stored in `row1` and `row2`, respectively. The variable `reachable_first_row` is still False, but `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True. The index `j` is still 0, and the character at this index in `row1` is not '>', while the character at this index in `row2` is '>'. Additionally, the current value of `j` is still less than `n - 1`.
