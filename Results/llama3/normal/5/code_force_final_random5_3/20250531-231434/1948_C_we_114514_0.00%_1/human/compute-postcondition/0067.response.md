Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 0, `reachable_first_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'NO', and `reachable_second_row` is False. If the first element of `row1` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` equals `n - 1`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False. If the first element of `row1` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is True if the first element of `row2` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False.***
