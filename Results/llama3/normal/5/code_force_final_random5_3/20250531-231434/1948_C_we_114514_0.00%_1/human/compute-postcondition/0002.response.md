Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of the first test case, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False**

The code assigns the first element of the first test case to `n`, the second element to `row1`, and the third element to `row2`. It also sets `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test_case`, and `results` remain unchanged.
