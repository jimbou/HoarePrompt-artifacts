Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `j` is `n`, `reachable_first_row` is False**

In this output state, a new variable `reachable_first_row` is introduced and assigned the value False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, `n` is at least 2, and `results` contains 'NO' is still valid. The value of `j` is still equal to `n`.
