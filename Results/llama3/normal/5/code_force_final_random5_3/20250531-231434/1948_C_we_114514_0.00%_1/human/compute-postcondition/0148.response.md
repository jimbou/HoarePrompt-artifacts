Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than `j`, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', `j` is `n + 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `reachable_first_row` is False if `row1[j]` is '>', otherwise it depends on the initial values of `j`, `n`, `row1`, `row2` and the first element of the first row of the third test case.**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `reachable_first_row` is still dependent on the initial values of `j`, `n`, `row1`, `row2` and the first element of the first row of the third test case, but it is False if `row1[j]` is '>'.
