Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is at least 1, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, j is equal to n - 1, reachable_second_row is True, and the character at index j of row2 is '>'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the given code snippet does not change any of the variables. The value of reachable_second_row is already True, so assigning True to it does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
