Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, test_case is the second test case in the list, n is at least 2, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, results is a list containing 'NO', reachable_second_row is True. If row1[j] is '>', then if j is equal to n-1, the state of the variables remains the same. Otherwise, j is equal to n+1. If row1[j] is not '>', then reachable_first_row is False. If j is less than n - 1 and row2[j] is '>', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
