Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is greater than 0, row1 is the first element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the third test case, j is equal to n minus 1, the current value of reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is True, results is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'. The current value of the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to `True`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the current test case, the number of rows, the first and second rows, the value of `j`, the value of `reachable_first_row`, and the results list all retain their original values.
