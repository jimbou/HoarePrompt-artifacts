Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is at least 2, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, j is either equal to n or less than n. If j is equal to n - 1, then reachable_second_row is True. Otherwise, reachable_second_row remains False.***
