Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 0, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing 'NO', and the first element of the second row of the second test case is not '>'**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_first_row` has been updated to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the current test case, the number of rows, the rows themselves, the index `j`, the reachability of the second row, the results list, and the first element of the second row of the second test case all retain their original values.
