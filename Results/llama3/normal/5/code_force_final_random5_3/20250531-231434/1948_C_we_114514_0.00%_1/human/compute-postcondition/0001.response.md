According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases. If the test_cases list has at least 1 test case the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of three elements: the first element is a positive even integer n, the second and third elements are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, results is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the test_cases list must have at least 1 test case and the test_case is the first test case in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
