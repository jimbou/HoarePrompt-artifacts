Output State: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of the first test case, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, j is equal to n, and reachable_second_row is True if the character at index n - 1 of row1 is '>' or if the character at index n - 1 of row2 is '>'. Otherwise, reachable_second_row remains False.

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables t, test_cases, test_case, results, n, row1, and row2 remain unchanged. The variable j is equal to n, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable reachable_second_row is True if the character at index n - 1 of row1 is '>' or if the character at index n - 1 of row2 is '>', indicating that the second row is reachable. Otherwise, reachable_second_row remains False.
