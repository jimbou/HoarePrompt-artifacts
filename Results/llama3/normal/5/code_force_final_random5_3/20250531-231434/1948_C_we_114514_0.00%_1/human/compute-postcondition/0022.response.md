Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is at least 1, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, j is either equal to n - 1 or less than n - 1, and reachable_second_row is True if the character at index j of row1 is '>' and j is equal to n - 1, or if the character at index j of row1 is not '>' and j is less than n - 1 and the character at index j of row2 is '>'. Otherwise, reachable_second_row remains False.***
