To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for test_case in test_cases:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `test_case` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, and `test_case` is the first test case in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases, and `test_case` must be the second test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is a positive integer, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is equal to `n`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing 'NO'.**
