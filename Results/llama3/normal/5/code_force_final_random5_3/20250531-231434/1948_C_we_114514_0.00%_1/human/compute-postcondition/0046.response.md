Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is less than `n`, `j` is at least 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `j` is equal to `n - 1` or the character at index `j` of `row2` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.***
