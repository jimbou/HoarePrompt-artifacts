Functionality: **This function evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive even integer n and two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It determines whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string from the start of the first string by moving right, and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings indicating the result for each test case. If it is possible to reach the end of the second string, the function returns 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
