Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is either equal to `n` or less than `n`. If `j` is equal to `n - 1` and the character at index `j` of `row1` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and the character at index `j` of `row1` is not '>' and the character at index `j` of `row2` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True and `reachable_first_row` is False. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain unchanged.***
