Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `j` is equal to `n`, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'**

The code appends 'NO' to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains four 'NO' values.
