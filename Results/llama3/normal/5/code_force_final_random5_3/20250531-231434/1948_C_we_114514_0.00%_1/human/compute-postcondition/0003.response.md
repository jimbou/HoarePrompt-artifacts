According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the first element of the first test case, which means it is already set to a value. However, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1. Additionally, the variable `j` is introduced in the loop head, which is not present in the initial state. We need to add `j` to the state and set it to 0, as it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is at least 1, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, j is 0**
