Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, j is equal to n, and reachable_second_row is True if the character at index n - 1 of row1 is '>' or if the character at index n - 1 of row2 is '>'. Otherwise, reachable_second_row remains False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all variables remain unchanged except for `j` which is now equal to `n`, and `reachable_second_row` which is True if the last character of either `row1` or `row2` is '>', and False otherwise.
