According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 3 test cases the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 test cases, test_case is the second test case in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 test cases and the test_case is the third test case in the list.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is equal to the first element of the third test case, row1 is the first element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the third test case, j is equal to n, reachable_first_row is False. If reachable_second_row is True, results is a list containing 'NO', 'YES', 'YES'. If reachable_second_row is False, results is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'.**
