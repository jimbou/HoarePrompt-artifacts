Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is equal to the first element of the third test case, row1 is the first element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the third test case, j is equal to n, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, results is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is greater than 0, row1 is the first element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the third test case. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>', then reachable_first_row is True and reachable_second_row is True if j is n minus 1, otherwise it is False. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', then if j is less than n - 1 and the current value of row2[j] is '>', then reachable_second_row is True. Otherwise, reachable_first_row is False and reachable_second_row is False. In all cases, results is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'. Additionally, if reachable_second_row is True, then the current value of reachable_second_row is True. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>', then the current value of reachable_first_row is True. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', then if j is less than n - 1 and the current value of row2[j] is '>', then the current value of reachable_second_row is True. In all cases, results is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than `n`, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', `j` is `n`. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>', then `reachable_first_row` is True and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is `n`, otherwise it is False. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', then if `j` is less than `n` and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is False. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True and `reachable_first_row` is False. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False. If `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False if `j` is not equal to `n - 1`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than `j`, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', `j` is `n + 1`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True and `reachable_first_row` is False if `j` is equal to `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is '>', otherwise it depends on the initial values of `j`, `n`, `row1`, `row2` and the first element of the first row of the third test case. If `j` is not equal to `n - 1`, then the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `row2[j]` is not '>', then if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to `reachable_second_row`. If `reachable_first_row` is False, then the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
