Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `j` is equal to `n`, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test_case`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `j`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. The only change is that the `results` list now contains an additional element, 'YES', which was appended to the list by the executed code.
