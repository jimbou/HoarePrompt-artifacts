Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `n` is a positive integer, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is equal to `n`, and `reachable_second_row` is True.**

In this output state, the code has appended 'YES' to the `results` list, indicating that the second row is reachable. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
