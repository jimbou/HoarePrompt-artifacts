Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `j` is `n+1`, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `reachable_first_row`, which is now set to False. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, with `t` being a positive integer, `test_cases` having at least 2 test cases, `test_case` being the second test case, `n` being at least 2, `row1` and `row2` being the second and third elements of the second test case respectively, `results` containing 'NO', `j` being `n+1`, and `reachable_second_row` being True.
