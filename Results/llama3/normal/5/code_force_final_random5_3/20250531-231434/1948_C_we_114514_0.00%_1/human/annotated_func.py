#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of three elements: the first element is a positive even integer n, the second and third elements are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases, test_case is the last test case in the list, n is equal to the first element of the last test case, row1 is the second element of the last test case, row2 is the third element of the last test case, j is equal to n, reachable_first_row is False. If reachable_second_row is True, results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in test_cases. If reachable_second_row is False, results is a list containing 'NO' for each test case in test_cases.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', representing the results of each test case in the test_cases list. The list contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case if reachable_second_row is True, otherwise, it contains 'NO' for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive even integer n and two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It determines whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string from the start of the first string by moving right, and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings indicating the result for each test case. If it is possible to reach the end of the second string, the function returns 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
