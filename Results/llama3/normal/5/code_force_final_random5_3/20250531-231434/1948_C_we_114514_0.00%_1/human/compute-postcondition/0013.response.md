Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` of `row1` is not '>'. If the current value of `j` is less than `n - 1` and the character at index `j` of `row2` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False.***
