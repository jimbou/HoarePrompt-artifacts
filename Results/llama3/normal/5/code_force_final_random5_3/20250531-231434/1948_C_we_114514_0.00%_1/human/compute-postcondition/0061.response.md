Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'NO', and the current value of the first element of `row1` is '>'. If `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False.***
