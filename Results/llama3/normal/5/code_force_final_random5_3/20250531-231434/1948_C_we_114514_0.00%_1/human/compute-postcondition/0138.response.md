Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than `n`, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', `j` is `n`. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>', then `reachable_first_row` is True and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is `n`, otherwise it is False. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', then if `j` is less than `n` and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is False. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True and `reachable_first_row` is False. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False. If `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False if `j` is not equal to `n - 1`.***
