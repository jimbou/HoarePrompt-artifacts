Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is less than `n`, `j` is at least 1, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the first test case, the results, the number of elements, the second and third elements of the first test case, and the indices `j` are all preserved. The only change is that `reachable_second_row` is now explicitly set to True.
