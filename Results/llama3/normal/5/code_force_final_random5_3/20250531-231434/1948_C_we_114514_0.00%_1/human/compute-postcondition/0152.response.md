Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is greater than 0, row1 is the first element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the third test case, j is equal to n, reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is True if the last element of row1 is '>' or the last element of row2 is '>', otherwise it is False, results is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test_case`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `reachable_first_row` is always False, because once it becomes False, it remains False for the rest of the loop iterations. The value of `reachable_second_row` depends on the last elements of `row1` and `row2`. If the last element of `row1` is '>' or the last element of `row2` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True; otherwise, it is False. The value of `results` remains unchanged, containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'.
