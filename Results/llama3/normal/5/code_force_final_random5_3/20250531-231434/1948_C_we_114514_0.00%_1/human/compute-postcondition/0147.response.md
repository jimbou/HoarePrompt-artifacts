Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than `n + 1`, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', `j` is `n + 1`. If `reachable_first_row` is True, then if `row1[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True and `reachable_first_row` is False if `j` is equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` depend on the initial values of `j`, `n`, `row1`, `row2` and the first element of the first row of the third test case. If `row1[j]` is not '>', then if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to `reachable_second_row`. If `reachable_first_row` is False, then the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.***
