Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `j` is `n`, `reachable_second_row` is True**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` is set to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases is still at least 2, and the values of `t`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `j` are still the same as before. The list `results` still contains 'NO'.
