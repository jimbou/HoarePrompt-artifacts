Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, test_case is the second test case in the list, n is at least 2, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, results is a list containing 'NO', j is n. If reachable_second_row is True, then if j is equal to n - 1, reachable_first_row is True and reachable_second_row is True. If j is less than n-1 and row2[j] is '>', then reachable_second_row is True. If j is less than n-1 and row2[j] is not '>', then the values of reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row are determined based on the values of row1 and row2 at index j. If reachable_second_row is False, then the values of reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row remain unchanged.***
