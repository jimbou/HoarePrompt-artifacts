Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, and the current value of `j` is equal to `n - 1`. Additionally, the current value of the first element of `row1` at index `j` is '>'**

In this output state, the only change is that `reachable_second_row` is now True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test_case`, `results`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, and `j` are still the same as in the initial state.
