Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than `n`, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', `j` is `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_first_row` has been updated to False, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `results` still contains 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', and `j` is still equal to `n`.
