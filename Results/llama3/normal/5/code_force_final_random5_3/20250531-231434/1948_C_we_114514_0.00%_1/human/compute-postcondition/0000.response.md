Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of three elements: the first element is a positive even integer `n`, the second and third elements are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `results` and assigned it an empty list.
