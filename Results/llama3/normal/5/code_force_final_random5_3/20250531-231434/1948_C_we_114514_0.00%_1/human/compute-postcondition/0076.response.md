The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`. So `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `j` is `n`**
