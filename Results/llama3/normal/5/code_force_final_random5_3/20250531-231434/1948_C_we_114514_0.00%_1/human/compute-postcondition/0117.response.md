Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `j` is 0, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', and the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', and the current value of `j` is less than `n - 1` and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the third test case, the number of rows, the first and second rows of the third test case, the index `j`, the reachability of the first row, the results list, and the conditions on the first element of the first row of the third test case and the current value of `j` and `row2[j]` are all still valid.
