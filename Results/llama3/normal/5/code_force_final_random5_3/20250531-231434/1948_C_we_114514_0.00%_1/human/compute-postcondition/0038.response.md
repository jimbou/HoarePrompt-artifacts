Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is less than `n`, `j` is at least 1, `reachable_second_row` is either True or unchanged, and `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `reachable_first_row`, which is now set to False. The list of test cases, the current test case, the results, the number of elements, the rows, and the index `j` remain unchanged. The value of `reachable_second_row` is either True or remains the same as before, depending on the previous conditions.
