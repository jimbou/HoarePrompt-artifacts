Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` of `row1` is not '>'**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_first_row` has been updated to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the first test case, the results list, the value of `n`, the second and third elements of the first test case, the value of `reachable_second_row`, and the index `j` remain the same. The character at index `j` of `row1` is still not '>'.
