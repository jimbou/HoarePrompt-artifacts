The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either equal to `n` or less than `n`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n` and increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `j + 1`. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is at least 3, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is less than `n`, `j` is at least 1. If `j` is equal to `n - 1` or the character at index `j` of `row2` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**
