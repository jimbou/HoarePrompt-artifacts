The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1` (since it was `n - 1` in the previous iteration), and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is `n`, but since `j` cannot be equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again if `j` is `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `n`, which is not possible. However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we can only adjust `j`. So, we will increase `j` by 1, but we will also make `n` greater than the new value of `j` so that the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than `n`, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>', then `reachable_first_row` is True and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is `n`, otherwise it is False. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', then if `j` is less than `n` and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is False. In all cases, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'. Additionally, if `reachable_second_row` is True, then the current value of `reachable_second_row` is True. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>', then the current value of `reachable_first_row` is True. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', then if `j` is less than `n` and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', then the current value of `reachable_second_row` is True. In all cases, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'. `j` is `n`.**
