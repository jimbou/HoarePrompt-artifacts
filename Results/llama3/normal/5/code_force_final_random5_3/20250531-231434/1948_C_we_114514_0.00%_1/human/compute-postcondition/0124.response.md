Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is greater than 0, row1 is the first element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the third test case. The current value of j is n minus 1. The current value of reachable_second_row is True. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>', then the current value of reachable_first_row is True. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', then the current value of row2[j] is '>', and the current value of reachable_second_row is True. In all cases, results is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'**

The code simply assigns the value True to the variable reachable_second_row. This does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that reachable_second_row is explicitly set to True.
