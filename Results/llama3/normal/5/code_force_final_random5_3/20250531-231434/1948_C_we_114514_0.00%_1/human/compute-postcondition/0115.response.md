Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `j` is 0, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', and the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>'**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_first_row` has been updated to False, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, the current test case, the number of rows, the rows themselves, the index `j`, the reachability of the second row, the results list, and the condition on the first element of the first row of the third test case are all still valid and unchanged.
