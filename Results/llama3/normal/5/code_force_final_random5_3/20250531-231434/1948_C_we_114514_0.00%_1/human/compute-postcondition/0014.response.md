Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, test_case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is at least 1, row1 is the second element of the first test case, row2 is the third element of the first test case, j is 0. If the character at index j of row1 is '>', then if j is equal to n - 1, reachable_second_row is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the character at index j of row1 is not '>', then if j is less than n - 1 and the character at index j of row2 is '>', reachable_second_row is True. Otherwise, reachable_second_row remains False.**
