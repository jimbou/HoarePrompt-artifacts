Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is greater than 0, row1 is the first element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the third test case, j is either 0 or n minus 1. The current value of reachable_second_row is True. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>', then the current value of reachable_first_row is True. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', then if j is less than n - 1 and the current value of row2[j] is '>', then the current value of reachable_second_row is True. In all cases, results is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'. Additionally, the current value of row2[j] is '>'**
