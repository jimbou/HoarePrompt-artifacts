Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, test_case is the second test case in the list, n is equal to the second element of the second test case, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, j is equal to the second element of the second test case, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, results is a list containing 'NO'
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO'. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_second_row` remains True. If the second element of the third row of the second test case is '>', then `j` is equal to `n - 1`. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then the state of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, test_case is the second test case in the list, n is at least 2, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, results is a list containing 'NO', j is n. If reachable_second_row is True, then if j is equal to n - 1, reachable_first_row is True and reachable_second_row is True. If j is less than n-1 and row2[j] is '>', then reachable_second_row is True. If j is less than n-1 and row2[j] is not '>', then the values of reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row are determined based on the values of row1 and row2 at index j. If reachable_second_row is False, then the values of reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, test_case is the second test case in the list, n is at least 2, row1 is the second element of the second test case, row2 is the third element of the second test case, results is a list containing 'NO', reachable_second_row is True. If j is equal to n-1, the state of the variables remains the same. Otherwise, if row1[j] is '>', then j is equal to n+1. If row1[j] is not '>', then reachable_first_row is False. If j is less than n - 1 and row2[j] is '>', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
