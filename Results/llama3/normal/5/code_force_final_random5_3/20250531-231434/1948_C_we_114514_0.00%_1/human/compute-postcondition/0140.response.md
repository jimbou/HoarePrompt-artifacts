The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than `n`. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is `n + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n + 1`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is greater than `n + 1`, `row1` is the first element of the third test case, `row2` is the second element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', `j` is `n + 1`. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is '>', then `reachable_first_row` is True and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is `n + 1`, otherwise it is False. If the first element of the first row of the third test case is not '>', then if `j` is less than `n + 1` and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is False. If `j` is equal to `n`, then `reachable_first_row` is False and `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` is less than `n` and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True and `reachable_first_row` is False. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False. If `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False if `j` is not equal to `n`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain False. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.**
