Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is equal to the second element of the second test case, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is equal to `n`, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'NO' and 'YES'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer. The list of test cases `test_cases` remains unchanged with at least 2 test cases. The current test case `test_case` is still the second test case in the list. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are still the same as before. The value of `j` is still equal to `n`. The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` maintain their previous values. The list `results` now contains two elements: 'NO' and 'YES'.
