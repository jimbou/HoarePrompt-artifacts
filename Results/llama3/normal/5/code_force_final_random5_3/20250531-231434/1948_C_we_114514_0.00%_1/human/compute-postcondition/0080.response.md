Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 2, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `j` is `n`, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been updated to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The state of the program now reflects that the second row is reachable, in addition to the existing conditions.
