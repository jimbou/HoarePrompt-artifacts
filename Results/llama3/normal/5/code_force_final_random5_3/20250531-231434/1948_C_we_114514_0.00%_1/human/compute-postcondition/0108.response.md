The only variables in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `n`, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 and `j` must be 0.

State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, test_case is the third test case in the list, n is greater than 0, row1 is the first element of the third test case, row2 is the second element of the third test case, j is 0, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, results is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'**
