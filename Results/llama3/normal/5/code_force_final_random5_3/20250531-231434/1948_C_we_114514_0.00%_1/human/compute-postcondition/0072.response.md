Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `reachable_second_row` is True, and the second element of the third row of the second test case is '>'**.

The code simply assigns the value True to the variable `reachable_second_row`, which does not change the values of the other variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `reachable_second_row` is explicitly set to True.
