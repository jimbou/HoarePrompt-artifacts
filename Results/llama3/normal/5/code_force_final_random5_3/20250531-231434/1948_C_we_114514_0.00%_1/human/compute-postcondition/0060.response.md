Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is at least 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing 'NO', and the current value of the first element of `row1` is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been changed to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases, the values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `j`, `reachable_first_row`, and `results` are still the same as in the initial state.
