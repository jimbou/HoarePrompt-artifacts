Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic of the robot's movement. The robot can move left, right, down, or up, and then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell. However, the program only checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by moving right from the first row or by moving down from the first row and then moving right from the second row. It does not consider the case where the robot moves up from the second row and then moves right from the first row.

For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
><>>

The program will output "NO", but the robot can actually reach the cell (2, 4) by moving up from the second row and then moving right from the first row.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
