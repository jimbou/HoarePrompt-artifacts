Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct the permutation p based on the given array a. The program iterates over the array a in reverse order and calculates the value of p_i as mex - a_i, where mex is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array p. The program also updates the value of mex to be the minimum of the current mex and p_i.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the constructed permutation p satisfies the condition a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i for all i. The program also handles the case where a_i is negative, which is allowed in the problem statement.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
