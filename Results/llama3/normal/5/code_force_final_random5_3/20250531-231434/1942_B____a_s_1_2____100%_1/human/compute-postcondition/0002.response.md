Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values equal to -1, mex is equal to n.**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1 as one test case has been processed. The value of `_` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. The code assigns the value of the first integer in the current test case to `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). It then assigns a list of `n` integers to `a`. The list `p` is initialized with `n` values equal to -1, but since `p` has a length of `n`, it actually has `n` values equal to -1, not `n-1`. The value of `mex` is set to `n`.
