To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is within the range of `n-1` to `-1` (inclusive).

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` values where all values are -1, `mex` is equal to `n`, and `i` is `n-1**
