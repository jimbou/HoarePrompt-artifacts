Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where the last value is equal to mex - a[i] and the rest are equal to -1, mex is equal to the minimum of its original value and mex - a[i], i is n-1, n must be greater than 0**
