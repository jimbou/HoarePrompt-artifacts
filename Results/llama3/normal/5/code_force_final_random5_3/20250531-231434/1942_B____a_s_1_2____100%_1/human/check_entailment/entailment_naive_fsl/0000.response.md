Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The key insight is to start from the end of the array and work backwards, using the fact that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` to determine the value of `p_i`.

The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value of `MEX` for the entire array. Then, for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - a_i` and updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the prefix of `p` up to index `i`.

The program then prints the constructed permutation `p`, which satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, and the examples provided in the problem description also work correctly with this program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
