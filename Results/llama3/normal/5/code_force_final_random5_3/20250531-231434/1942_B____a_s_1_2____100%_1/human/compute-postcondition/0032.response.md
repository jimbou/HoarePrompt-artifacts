The code prints the elements of the list `p`. The list `p` contains `n` values where each value is `mex - a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Here, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between `mex` and `mex - a[0]`. Since `i` is -1, it does not affect the values in the list `p`.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]] (where mex is the minimum value between mex and mex - a[0], and a[i] are the elements of the list a)**
