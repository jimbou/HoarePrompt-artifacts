To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `n-1` down to `0` in reverse order, decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `t` is an integer between `0` and `10^4 - 2` (inclusive)
* `n` is an integer between `1` and `2 * 10^5` (inclusive)
* `a` is a list of `n` integers
* `p` is a list of `n` values where all values are `-1` except for the last value which is `mex - a[i]`
* `mex` is equal to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[i]`
* `i` is `n-1`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the values of `i` and `p` (since `mex` is dependent on `p[i]`).

Since `i` is decremented by `1` in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `n-2`.

The value of `p` will also change, as the last value of `p` is `mex - a[i]`. Since `i` is now `n-2`, the last value of `p` will be `mex - a[n-2]`.

The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between `0` and `10^4 - 2` (inclusive), `n` is an integer between `1` and `2 * 10^5` (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` values where all values are `-1` except for the last value which is `mex - a[n-2]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[n-2]`, and `i` is `n-2`**
