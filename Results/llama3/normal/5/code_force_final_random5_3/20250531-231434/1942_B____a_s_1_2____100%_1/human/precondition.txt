stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), representing the length of the permutation p and the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), representing the elements of array a.
