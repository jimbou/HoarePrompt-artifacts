The code prints the elements of the list `p` which contains values that are the difference between the minimum value between `mex` and all `mex - a[i]`, and each element `a[i]` in the list `a`.
Output: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are mex - a[i], mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and all mex - a[i], and i is -n, and the elements of the list p are printed**
