Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values equal to -1, mex is equal to n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    p[i] = mex - a[i]
    mex = min(mex, p[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where the last value is equal to mex - a[i] and the rest are equal to -1, mex is equal to the minimum of its original value and mex - a[i], i is n-1, n must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-4 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where the last two values are equal to mex - a[i] and the rest are equal to -1, mex is equal to the minimum of its original value and mex - a[i], i is n-1, n must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where the last value is equal to mex - a[i], mex is equal to the minimum of its original value and mex - a[i], i is n-2, n must be greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
