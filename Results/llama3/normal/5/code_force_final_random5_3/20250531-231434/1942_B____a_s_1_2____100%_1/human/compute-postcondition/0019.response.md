Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values except the last three are -1 and the last three are mex - a[i], mex - a[i - 1], and mex - a[i - 2], mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i - 2], and i is n - 3, _ is 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `p` is modified by the code, where the value at index `i` is updated to `mex - a[i]`, and the value of `mex` is updated to the minimum value between `mex` and `mex - a[i - 2]`. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
