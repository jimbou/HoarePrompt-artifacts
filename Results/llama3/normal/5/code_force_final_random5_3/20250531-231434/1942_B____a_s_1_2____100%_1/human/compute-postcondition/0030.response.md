Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are -1 except for the last three values which are mex - a[n-2], mex - a[n-3], and mex - a[n-4] respectively, mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and mex - a[n-4], and i is n-3**

The code modifies the list `p` by assigning the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`, where `i` is `n-3`. This changes the value of `p[i]` from `-1` to `mex - a[n-4]`. The second line updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum between its current value and the new value of `p[i]`, which is `mex - a[n-4]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the minimum value between its current value and the value of `mex - a[n-4]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
