Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input: It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. The program correctly initializes the permutation `p` and the variable `mex`: It initializes `p` as a list of `-1`s of length `n` and `mex` as `n`.

3. The program correctly calculates the permutation `p`: It iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. Then, it updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This is correct because `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p` up to the current index `i`.

4. The program correctly prints the permutation `p`: After calculating the permutation `p`, it prints it.

5. The program correctly handles multiple test cases: It uses a loop to read and process each test case separately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
