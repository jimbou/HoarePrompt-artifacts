Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input: It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2.  The program correctly initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` and the `mex` (minimum excluded value) with `n`.

3.  The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` in reverse order. It starts from the end of the array `a` and for each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` in the permutation as `mex - a[i]`. Then, it updates the `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This is because the `mex` of a prefix of the permutation is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in that prefix.

4.  The program correctly prints the constructed permutation `p`.

5.  The time complexity of the program is O(t \* n), where `t` is the number of test cases and `n` is the length of the permutation. This is because the program iterates over each test case and for each test case, it iterates over the array `a` once.

6.  The space complexity of the program is O(n), where `n` is the length of the permutation. This is because the program uses a list `p` of size `n` to store the permutation.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
