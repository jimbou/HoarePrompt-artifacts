Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a valid permutation p based on the given array a. The program iterates over the array a in reverse order and constructs the permutation p by subtracting each element of a from the current minimum non-negative integer (mex) that does not appear in the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Initialize an array p of size n with all elements set to -1. This array will store the constructed permutation.
2. Initialize a variable mex to n, which represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
3. Iterate over the array a in reverse order (from n-1 to 0).
4. For each element a[i] in the array a, calculate the corresponding element p[i] in the permutation p as mex - a[i].
5. Update the value of mex to be the minimum of its current value and p[i]. This ensures that mex always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
6. After iterating over the entire array a, the constructed permutation p is printed.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the constructed permutation p satisfies the condition a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i for each element a_i in the array a.

Correctness: **True**
