This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates a list of values p, where each value is the difference between the minimum value of the list and the corresponding value in the input list a. The function prints the list p for each test case. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value, but it modifies the standard input by consuming the test cases. The final state of the program is that the standard input is empty, and the list p has been printed for each test case.
