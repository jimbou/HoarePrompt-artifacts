Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), stdin is empty, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values except the last two are -1 and the last two are mex - a[i] and mex - a[i - 1], mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i - 1], and i is n - 2**

The code modifies the value of `p[i]` and `mex`. The first line assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`, and the second line updates `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, the last two elements of `p` are updated. The value of `mex` is updated based on the new value of `p[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
