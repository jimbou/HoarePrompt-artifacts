The code prints the elements of the list `p`. The list `p` contains `n` values, where each value is the difference between `mex` and the corresponding element `a[i]` in the list `a`. Since `mex` is the minimum value between `mex` and all `mex - a[i]`, it means that `mex` is the smallest possible value that is not present in the list `a`.

Since `i` is `-n`, it is not used in the calculation of the elements of `p`. The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the elements of the list `p` and print them separately.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]] (where mex is the smallest possible value not present in the list a)**
