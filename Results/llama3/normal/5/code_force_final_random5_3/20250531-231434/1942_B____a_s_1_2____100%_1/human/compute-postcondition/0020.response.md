Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are mex - a[i], mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and all mex - a[i], and i is -n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list p contains the values mex - a[i] for all i, mex is the minimum value between mex and all mex - a[i], and i is -n. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
