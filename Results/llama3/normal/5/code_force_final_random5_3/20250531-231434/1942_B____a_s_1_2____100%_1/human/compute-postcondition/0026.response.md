Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are -1 except for the last value which is mex - a[i], mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and p[i], and i is n-1**

The code modifies the value of `p[i]` by assigning it the value of `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is initially equal to `n` and `a[i]` is the last element of the list `a`. This changes the value of `p[i]` from -1 to a new value. The second line updates the value of `mex` by assigning it the minimum value between its current value (`n`) and the new value of `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, the minimum value will be either `n` or `mex - a[i]`, depending on which is smaller. The value of `i` remains unchanged at `n-1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and the rest of the elements in `a` and `p`) remain unaffected by the code.
