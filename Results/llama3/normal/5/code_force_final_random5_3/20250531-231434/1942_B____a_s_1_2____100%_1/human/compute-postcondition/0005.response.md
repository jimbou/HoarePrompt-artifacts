The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is n-1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1, so `i` is n-2. 
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n), _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where the last value is equal to mex - a[i] and the rest are equal to -1, mex is equal to the minimum of its original value and mex - a[i], i is n-2, n must be greater than 0**
