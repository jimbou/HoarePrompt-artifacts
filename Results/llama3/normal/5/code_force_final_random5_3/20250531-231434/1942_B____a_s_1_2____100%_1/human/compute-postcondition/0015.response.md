Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values except the last one are -1 and the last one is mex - a[i], mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and mex - a[i], and i is n - 1.**

The first line assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`, modifying the last element of the list `p`. Since `mex` is equal to `n` and `a[i]` is an integer, the last element of `p` becomes `n - a[i]`. The second line assigns the minimum value between `mex` and `p[i]` to `mex`. Since `p[i]` is `n - a[i]`, `mex` becomes the minimum value between `n` and `n - a[i]`. No other variables are affected.
