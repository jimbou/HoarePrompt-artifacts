Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are -1 except for the last two values which are mex - a[n-2] and mex - a[n-3] respectively, mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and mex - a[n-3], and i is n-2**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `p` is modified by the code, where the value at index `i` (which is `n-2`) is updated to `mex - a[i]`, and the last value is still `mex - a[n-2]`. The value of `mex` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and `mex - a[n-3]`. The value of `i` is updated to `n-2`.
