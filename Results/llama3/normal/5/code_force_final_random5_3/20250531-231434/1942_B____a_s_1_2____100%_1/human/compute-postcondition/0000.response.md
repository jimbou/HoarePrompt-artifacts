The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-n <= a_i <= n).

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The input now contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-n <= a_i <= n).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-n <= a_i <= n).**
