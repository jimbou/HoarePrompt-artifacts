According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the loop starts from `n - 1` and goes down to `-1`, so `i` needs to be adjusted to `n - 1` for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n` values where all values are -1, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, and the list `p` is being printed**
