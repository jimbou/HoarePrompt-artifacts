To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is not explicitly used, its value is still incremented).

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), and `i` is -n. Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly used, we can ignore it.

For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), we can decrement it by 1.

The other variables `n`, `a`, `p`, `mex`, and `i` are not part of the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `p` is a list of n values where all values are mex - a[i], `mex` is equal to the minimum value between mex and all mex - a[i], and `i` is -n**
