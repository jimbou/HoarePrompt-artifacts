Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n -1 values where all values are equal to mex - a[i], mex is equal to the minimum of its original value and mex - a[i], i is -1, n must be greater than 0**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `i` has reached `-1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The list `p` has been fully populated with values equal to `mex - a[i]`, and `mex` has been updated to its final value, which is the minimum of its original value and the minimum of `mex - a[i]` for all `i`. The other variables, `t`, `_`, `n`, and `a`, remain unchanged.
