Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are mex - a[i] for i from 0 to n-1, mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and mex - a[0], and i is -1**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n times, and the values of p have been updated accordingly. The value of mex has been updated to be the minimum value between its initial value and the minimum value of mex - a[i] for all i from 0 to n-1. The value of i has been updated to -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
