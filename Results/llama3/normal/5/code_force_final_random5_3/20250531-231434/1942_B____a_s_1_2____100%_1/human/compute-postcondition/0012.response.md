To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `_` is 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive)

The other variables in the state, such as `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `p`, `mex`, and `i`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list of `n - 1` values where all values are equal to `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is equal to the minimum of its original value and `mex - a[i]`, `i` is -1, and the list `p` is being printed**
