Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are -1, mex is equal to n, i is -1, and the list p is being printed**

The provided code snippet reads an integer `n` from `stdin`, assigns it to `n`, and then reads a space-separated list of integers from `stdin`, assigning it to `a`. It then initializes a list `p` with `n` elements, all set to -1, and sets `mex` to `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at -1. The list `p` is being printed. 

Note that the initial state of `stdin` containing 0 test cases is updated to contain 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, as two `input()` calls are made. The values of `t`, `_`, and `i` are not affected by the code and remain the same.
