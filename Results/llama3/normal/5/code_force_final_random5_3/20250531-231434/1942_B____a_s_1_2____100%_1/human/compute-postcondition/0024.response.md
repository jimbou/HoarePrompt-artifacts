Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are -1, mex is equal to n, and i is -n**

The code snippet provided does not modify the value of `t`, `i`, or `mex` directly. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, but since `n` was already defined as an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), this does not change its range. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `a`, but since `a` was already defined as a list of `n` integers, this does not change its type or size. The third line assigns a list of `n` values where all values are -1 to `p`, but since `p` was already defined as a list of `n` values where all values are mex - a[i], this changes the values of `p` to -1. The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to `mex`, but since `mex` was already defined as equal to the minimum value between mex and all mex - a[i], this does not change its value.
