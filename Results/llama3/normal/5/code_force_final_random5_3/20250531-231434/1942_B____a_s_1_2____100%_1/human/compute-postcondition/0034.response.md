Output State: **t is 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is t, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, p is a list of n values where all values are mex - a[i] for i from 0 to n-1, mex is equal to the minimum value between mex and mex - a[0], and i is -1, and the list p is printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `t` has reached 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The input buffer `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been read. The loop variable `_` has reached its final value, which is equal to the initial value of `t`. The variables `n`, `a`, `p`, `mex`, and `i` retain their last values after the last iteration of the loop. The list `p` has been printed, containing the final values of `mex - a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
