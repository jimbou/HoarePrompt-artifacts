The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the current values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are as described. Otherwise, the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged.**
