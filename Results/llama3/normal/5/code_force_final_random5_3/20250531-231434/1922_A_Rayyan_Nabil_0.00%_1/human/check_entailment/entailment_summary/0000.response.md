Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the fact that the variable `l` is being overwritten in each iteration of the inner loop. If the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is met for at least one `i`, `l` will be set to `'YES'`. However, if this condition is not met for any `i`, the `else` clause will set `l` to `'NO'`, regardless of the previous values of `l`. This means that the program will only print `'YES'` if the condition is met for the last `i`, and `'NO'` otherwise.

Moreover, the program does not correctly implement the logic of the problem. The problem requires finding a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t`, but `c` does not. The program only checks if there exists a position `i` where `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]`, which is not sufficient to guarantee that `a` and `b` match the same template.

Correctness: **False**
