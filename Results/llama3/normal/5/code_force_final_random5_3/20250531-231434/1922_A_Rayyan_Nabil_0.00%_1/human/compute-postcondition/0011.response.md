Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the current values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are as described. Otherwise, the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged.**

The code only changes the value of `l` to 'YES', leaving all other variables and conditions unchanged.
