The code prints the value of `l`, which is either 'YES' or 'NO'. The value of `l` depends on whether there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If such an index exists, `l` is 'YES', otherwise it is 'NO'.

Output: **YES if there exists at least one i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise NO**
