Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, l is 'YES' if there exists at least one i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] in any of the test cases, otherwise l is 'NO', i is t, n is an integer, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, the variable `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one pair of strings `a`, `b`, and `c` in any of the test cases where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise `l` is 'NO'. The variable `i` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their last values from the last iteration of the loop. The standard input `stdin` is empty, as all the test cases have been processed.
