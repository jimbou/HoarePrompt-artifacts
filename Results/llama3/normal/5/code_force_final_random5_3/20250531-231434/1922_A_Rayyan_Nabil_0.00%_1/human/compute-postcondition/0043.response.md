Output State: **t is an integer greater than n+2, l is 'YES' if there exists at least one i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO', i is n, n is an integer, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `l` will be `'YES'` if there exists at least one position `i` where the characters in strings `a` and `b` are different from the character in string `c`, otherwise `l` will be `'NO'`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the other variables remain unchanged.
