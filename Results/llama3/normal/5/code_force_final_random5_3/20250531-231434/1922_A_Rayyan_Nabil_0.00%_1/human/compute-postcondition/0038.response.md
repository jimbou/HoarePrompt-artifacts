Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than n+2, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. If a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], then the current values of a[i], b[i], and c[i] are noted. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to 'YES', while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-5 inputs, and the conditions for a[i], b[i], and c[i] remain the same.
