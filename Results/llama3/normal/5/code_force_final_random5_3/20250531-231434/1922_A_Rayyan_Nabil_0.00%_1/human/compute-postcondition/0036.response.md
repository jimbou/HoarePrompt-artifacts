Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than n+2, l is 'YES', i is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. If a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], then the current values of a[i], b[i], and c[i] are noted. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
