Output State: **t is an integer greater than n+2, l is 'YES', i is n+1, n is an integer, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**

The code reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is assigned to the variable `n`. This does not affect the value of `t`, `l`, or `i`. The code then reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from stdin, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. These strings are assigned to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. The value of `l` remains 'YES' as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains `n+1` as it is not modified by the code. The value of `t` remains an integer greater than `n+2` as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains `t-5` inputs as four inputs have been read.
