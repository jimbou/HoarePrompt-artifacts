The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `t` becomes that integer. The second line assigns the string 'YES' to `l`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, l is 'YES', stdin contains t-1 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
