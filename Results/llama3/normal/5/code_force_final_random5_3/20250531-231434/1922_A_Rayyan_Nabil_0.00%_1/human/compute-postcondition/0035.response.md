Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n+2`, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-5` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**

The code simply assigns the value 'YES' to the variable `l`, without changing any other variables or the stdin. The initial state remains the same, except for the updated value of `l`.
