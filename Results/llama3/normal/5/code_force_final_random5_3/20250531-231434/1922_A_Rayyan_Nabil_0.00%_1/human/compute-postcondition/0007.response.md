To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the current values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are as described. Otherwise, the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged.**
