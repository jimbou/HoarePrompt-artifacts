The code prints the value of `l`, which is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.

Output: **t is an integer greater than n+2, l is 'YES' if there exists at least one i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO', i is n, n is an integer, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, and 'YES' is printed if there exists at least one i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise 'NO' is printed**
