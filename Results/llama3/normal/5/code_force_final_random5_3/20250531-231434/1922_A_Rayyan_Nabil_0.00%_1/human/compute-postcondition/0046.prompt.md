Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, l is 'YES', stdin contains t-1 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            l = 'YES'
    else:
        l = 'NO'
    print(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the current values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are as described. Otherwise, the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged, and 'YES' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than n+1, l is 'YES', i is n, n is an integer, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, and 'YES' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than n+2, l is 'YES' if there exists at least one i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO', i is n, n is an integer, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, and 'YES' is printed if there exists at least one i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
