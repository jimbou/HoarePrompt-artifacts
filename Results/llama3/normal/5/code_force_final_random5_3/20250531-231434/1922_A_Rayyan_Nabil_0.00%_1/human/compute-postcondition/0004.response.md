Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**
