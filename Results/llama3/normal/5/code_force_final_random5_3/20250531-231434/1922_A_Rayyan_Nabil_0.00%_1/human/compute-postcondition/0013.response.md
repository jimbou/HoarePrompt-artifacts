Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the current values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are as described. Otherwise, the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations means that the loop has finished executing and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The value of `l` is still 'YES', indicating that at least one iteration of the loop found a mismatch between `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the loop. The state of the other variables, `t` and stdin, remains unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
