Output State: **t is an integer greater than n+1, l is 'YES', i is n, n is an integer, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations means that the loop has finished executing, and the variable 'i' has reached the value 'n'. The variable 'l' remains 'YES' if at least one pair of characters in strings 'a', 'b', and 'c' at the same position 'i' were different, otherwise, it would be 'NO'. The other variables 't', 'n', 'a', 'b', 'c', and the input in stdin remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
