The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n+1, which does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and n is greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer greater than n+2, l is 'YES', i is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-5 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
