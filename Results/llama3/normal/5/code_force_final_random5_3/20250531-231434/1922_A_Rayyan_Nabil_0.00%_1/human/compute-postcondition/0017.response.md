Output State: **t is an integer greater than n+1, l is 'YES', i is n+1, n is an integer, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**

The code reads the next three inputs from stdin, assigning the integer value to `n`, and the three strings to `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. The values of `t`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of inputs in stdin decreases by 3.
