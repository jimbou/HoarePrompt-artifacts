Output State: **t is an integer greater than n+1, l is 'YES', i is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. If the current value of a[i] is not equal to c[i] and the current value of b[i] is not equal to c[i], then the current values of a[i], b[i], and c[i] are noted. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, as the given code only assigns the value 'YES' to the variable l, which was already 'YES' in the initial state. Therefore, no changes have been made to the state of the program.
