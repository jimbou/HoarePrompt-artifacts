Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `n+1`, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-3` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the current values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are noted. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to 'YES', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` inputs, and the conditions for noting the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are still in effect.
