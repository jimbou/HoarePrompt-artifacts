According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the starting point of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', stdin contains `t-1` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0**
