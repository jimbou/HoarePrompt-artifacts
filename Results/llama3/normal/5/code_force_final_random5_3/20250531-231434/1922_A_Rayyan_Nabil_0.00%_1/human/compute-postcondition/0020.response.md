Output State: **t is an integer greater than n+1, l is 'YES', i is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. The current value of a[i] is not equal to c[i] and the current value of b[i] is not equal to c[i].**

In this output state, the value of variable `l` has been updated to 'YES', while the values of other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 inputs, and the conditions on the strings a, b, and c are still valid.
