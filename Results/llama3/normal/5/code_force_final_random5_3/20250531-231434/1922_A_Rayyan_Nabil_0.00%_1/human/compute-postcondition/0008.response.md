Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains `t-2` inputs: each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the current values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are as described. Otherwise, the values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `l` is now 'YES'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The conditions on `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` also remain the same.
