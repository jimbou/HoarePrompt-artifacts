The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n+1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **t is an integer greater than n+1, l is 'YES', i is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-3 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
