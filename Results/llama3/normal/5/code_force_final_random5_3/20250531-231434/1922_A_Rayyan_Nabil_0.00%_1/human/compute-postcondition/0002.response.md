Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, l is 'YES', i is 0, n is an integer, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, stdin contains t-2 inputs: each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters**

The code reads the next test case from stdin, which consists of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. The value of `n` is assigned to the variable `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `t` is not modified by the code, so it remains an integer between 1 and 1000. The variable `l` is also not modified, so it remains 'YES'. The stdin now contains `t-2` inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`.
