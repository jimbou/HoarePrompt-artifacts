The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will print the results of `func_1(arr)` for each test case, where each result is separated by a newline character (`\n`).

Since `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(arr)` for each test case, and `func_1(arr)` is not defined in the precondition, we can't determine the exact values of the results. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **the results of func_1(arr) for each test case, separated by newline characters, where each result is the output of func_1(arr) for the corresponding test case**
