Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data, results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(arr)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1 + n + 1, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data and greater than 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr), _ is 0, n is a positive integer equal to the second element of data, arr is a list of n positive integers, result is the result of func_1(arr)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1 + n + 1 + n, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data and greater than 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr), _ is 1, n is a positive integer equal to the second element of data, arr is a list of n positive integers, result is the result of func_1(arr)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1 + n + 1 + n, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data and greater than 2, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr), _ is 2, n is a positive integer equal to the second element of data, arr is a list of n positive integers, result is the result of func_1(arr), index is 1 + n + 1 + n




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
