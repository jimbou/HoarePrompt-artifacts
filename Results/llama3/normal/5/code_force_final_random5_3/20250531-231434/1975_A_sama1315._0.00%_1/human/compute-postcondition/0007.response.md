Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1 + n + 1 + n + ... + n, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data and greater than or equal to 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) for each test case, _ is t-1, n is a positive integer equal to the second element of data, arr is a list of n positive integers, result is the result of func_1(arr), index is 1 + n + 1 + n + ... + n**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has processed all the test cases in the data list. The index has moved to the end of the data list, and the results list contains the results of func_1(arr) for each test case. The variable _ has reached its final value, which is t-1, indicating that the loop has executed t times. The variables n, arr, and result still hold the values of the last test case processed.
