Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data, results is an empty list.**

The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `data`. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and stored in the variable `t`. The index is incremented to 1, and an empty list `results` is created. No other variables are affected.
