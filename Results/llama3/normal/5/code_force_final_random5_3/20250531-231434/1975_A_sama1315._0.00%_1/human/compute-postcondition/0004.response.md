Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1 + n + 1 + n, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data and greater than 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr), _ is 1, n is a positive integer equal to the second element of data, arr is a list of n positive integers, result is the result of func_1(arr)**

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to the second element of `data`, which is a positive integer. The `index` has been incremented by `n` twice, once after reading `n` and again after reading the `n` positive integers. The `arr` list now contains the `n` positive integers read from `data`. The `result` variable holds the result of calling `func_1` with `arr` as an argument, and this result has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
