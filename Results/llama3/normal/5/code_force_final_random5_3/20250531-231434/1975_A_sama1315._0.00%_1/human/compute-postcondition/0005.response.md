To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to remain greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1 + n + 1 + n, `t` is a positive integer equal to the first element of `data` and greater than 2, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(arr)`, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer equal to the second element of `data`, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `result` is the result of `func_1(arr)`**
