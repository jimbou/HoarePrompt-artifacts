Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining whether an array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted and 'No' otherwise. However, this function does not consider the possibility of swapping parts of the array to make it sorted.

`func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case. It then prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

The issue with the program is that `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks if the array is already sorted, but it does not consider the possibility of swapping parts of the array to make it sorted. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for cases where the array can be made sorted by swapping parts.

Correctness: **False**
