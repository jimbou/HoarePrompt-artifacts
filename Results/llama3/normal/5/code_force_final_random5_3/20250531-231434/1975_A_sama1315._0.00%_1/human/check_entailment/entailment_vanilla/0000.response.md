Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation some number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.

Function 1, `func_1`, checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns 'Yes'. If the array is not sorted, the function checks if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are in the correct order (i.e., the current element is less than or equal to the next element). If such a pair is found, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by swapping the two parts. If no such pair is found, the function returns 'No'.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads the input data, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

The provided program is correct because it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array can be sorted by swapping the two parts, and the `func_2` function correctly reads the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
