Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping its prefix and suffix. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a list of integers as input and checks if it is already sorted in ascending order. If it is, the function returns 'Yes'. If not, the function checks if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second element. If such a pair exists, the function returns 'No', indicating that the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping its prefix and suffix. If no such pair exists, the function returns 'Yes'.

`func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it into a list of test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case. The results are then printed out.

The program's logic is correct. `func_1` correctly checks if the input array is already sorted or can be sorted by swapping its prefix and suffix. `func_2` correctly reads and parses the input data and applies `func_1` to each test case.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In `func_1`, the condition `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))` is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by swapping its prefix and suffix. This condition only checks if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second element, but it does not consider the case where the array can be sorted by swapping its prefix and suffix.

To fix this issue, `func_1` should be modified to check if the array can be sorted by swapping its prefix and suffix. One possible way to do this is to check if the array is sorted in ascending order when its prefix and suffix are swapped.

Correctness: **False**
