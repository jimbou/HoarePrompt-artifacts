Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1 + n + 1, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data and greater than 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr), _ is 0, n is a positive integer equal to the second element of data, arr is a list of n positive integers, result is the result of func_1(arr)**

In this output state, the code has processed the first test case in the data list. The index has moved to the next test case, and the results list now contains the result of func_1(arr) for the first test case. The value of n is the number of positive integers in the first test case, and arr is the list of those positive integers. The result variable holds the result of func_1(arr) for the first test case. All other variables remain unchanged.
