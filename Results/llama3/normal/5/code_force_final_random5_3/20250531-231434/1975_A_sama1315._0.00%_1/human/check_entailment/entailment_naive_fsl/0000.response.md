Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description asks to determine whether the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. However, the program only checks if the array is already sorted or if it can be sorted by swapping the two parts without considering the actual operation described in the problem.

For example, if the input array is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], the program will return 'No' because it does not consider the operation of splitting the array into [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] and swapping them to get [4, 1, 5, 3, 1], which is not sorted. However, the program should return 'Yes' because the array can be sorted by performing the operation.

The correct implementation should check all possible splits of the array and verify if the resulting array is sorted after swapping the two parts.
