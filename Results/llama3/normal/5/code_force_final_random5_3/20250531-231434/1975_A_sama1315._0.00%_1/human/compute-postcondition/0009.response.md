Output: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, followed by n positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1 + n + 1 + n + ... + n, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data and greater than or equal to 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) for each test case, _ is t-1, n is a positive integer equal to the second element of data, arr is a list of n positive integers, result is the result of func_1(arr), index is 1 + n + 1 + n + ... + n, and the results of func_1(arr) for each test case are printed, each on a new line**
