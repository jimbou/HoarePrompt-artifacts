Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether an array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times. 

Function 1 (`func_1`) checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted and 'No' otherwise.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of test cases, and then applies `func_1` to each test case. It then prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

However, the problem statement requires the program to determine whether the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation any number of times. The current implementation only checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check all possible splits of the array and verify if any of them can be sorted in non-decreasing order after swapping the two parts. The current implementation does not perform this check.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
