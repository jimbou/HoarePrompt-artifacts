The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer `t`, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer `n`, followed by `n` positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1, `t` is a positive integer equal to the first element of `data`, `results` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer `t`, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer `n`, followed by `n` positive integers. The list is 1-indexed and the index is 1, `t` is a positive integer equal to the first element of `data` and greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
