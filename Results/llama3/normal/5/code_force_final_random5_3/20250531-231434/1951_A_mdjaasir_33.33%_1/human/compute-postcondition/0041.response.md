The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a binary string of size t equal to the input string, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and count is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
