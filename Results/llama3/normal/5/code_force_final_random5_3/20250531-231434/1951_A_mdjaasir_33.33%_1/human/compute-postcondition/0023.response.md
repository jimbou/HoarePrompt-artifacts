Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string of size t, count is the number of '1' in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and count is not equal to 0. If count is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2, then if the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
