Postcondition: ***t is greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a binary string of size t equal to the input string, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and count is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is not greater than 2 and count is not even, then if the binary string a contains exactly two '1' characters and a '1' followed by a character other than '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
