Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the count of '1's is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, it is impossible to turn on only one lamp, but the program does not check for this case. 

For example, if the input is:

1
3
101

The program will print 'NO', but it should print 'NO' because it is impossible to turn on only one lamp.
