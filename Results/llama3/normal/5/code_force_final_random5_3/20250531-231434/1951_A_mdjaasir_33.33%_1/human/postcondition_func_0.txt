This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer t and a binary string of size t. It then checks the number of '1' characters in the binary string and prints 'YES' if the count is 0, greater than 2 and even, or exactly 2 with the first '1' not followed by another '1'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
