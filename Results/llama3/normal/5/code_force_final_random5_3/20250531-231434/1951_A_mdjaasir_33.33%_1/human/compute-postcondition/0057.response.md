Output State: **t is 0, i is t, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a binary string of size t equal to the input string, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus t. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count is greater than 2 and count is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, the variable i will be equal to the initial value of t, the variable n will be equal to the input value, the variable a will be equal to the input string, and the variable count will be equal to the number of '1' characters in a. The loop will have processed all the test cases in stdin, and the output will be 'YES' if the count of '1' characters in a is 0, or if the count is greater than 2 and is even, or if the count is 2 and the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1'. Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'.
