Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string of size t, count is the number of '1' in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and count is not equal to 0. Additionally, either count is less than or equal to 2 or count is not divisible by 2. If count is 2, then if the first '1' in a is not followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. If the first '1' in a is followed by another '1', 'NO' is printed. If count is not equal to 2, then 'NO' is printed.***
