Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `j` is `k + 96`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive).
- The value of `i` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `n` remains an integer, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The value of `k` is still an integer but must be at least as large as the number of iterations the loop executed.
- The string `s` now contains `k` characters, starting from 'a' (ASCII value 97) up to the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`. For example, if `k` is 3, `s` would be 'abc'.
- The content of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-2` lines of input, each with two integers `n` and `k`.
- The value of `j` after the loop finishes is `k + 96`, which is the ASCII value of the last character added to the string `s`.
