Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string containing two characters, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is at least 98**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to contain two characters, where the second character is the result of converting the integer `j` to a character using the `chr` function. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
