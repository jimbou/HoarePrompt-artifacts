Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, s is an empty string, stdin contains t-2 lines of input, each containing two integers n and k.**

Explanation: The first line of the code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. This operation reduces the number of lines in the standard input by 1, leaving `t-2` lines. The second line initializes an empty string `s`. The value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
