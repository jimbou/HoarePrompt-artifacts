Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `n` is an integer, but its value is not explicitly given. However, since `i` is 2, we can infer that `n` might be related to the value of `i`. Without more information, we can't determine the exact value of `n`.
* `s` is a string containing 1 character. The value of `s` is not explicitly given, but since `j` is 97, which is the ASCII value of the character 'a', we can infer that `s` might be related to the character 'a'.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(n * s)`

This statement will print the string `s` repeated `n` times.

Since we can't determine the exact value of `n`, we can't determine the exact number of times `s` will be repeated. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[s] repeated [n] times (where s is a string containing 1 character, possibly 'a', and n is an integer)**
