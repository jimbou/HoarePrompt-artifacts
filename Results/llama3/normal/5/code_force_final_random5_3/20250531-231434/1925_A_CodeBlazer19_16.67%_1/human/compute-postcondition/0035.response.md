According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `k + 96`, so it needs to be adjusted to be at least 97. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `s` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is at least 97**
