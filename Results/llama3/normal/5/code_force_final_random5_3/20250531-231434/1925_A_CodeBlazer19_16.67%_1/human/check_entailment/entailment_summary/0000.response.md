Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a string s such that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s.

The program works by first reading the number of test cases t. Then, for each test case, it reads two integers n and k. It constructs a string s containing k characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value k + 96.

If k is 1, the program prints a string of n repetitions of the character 'a'. This is because when k is 1, there is only one possible string of length n, which is a string of n 'a's.

If k is not 1, the program prints either 2 times the string s or the string s, depending on whether n is equal to 1 or not. This is because when k is not 1, the program needs to ensure that all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s. By printing 2 times the string s when n is not 1, the program ensures that all possible strings of length n are covered.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
