The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `j` is `k + 96**
