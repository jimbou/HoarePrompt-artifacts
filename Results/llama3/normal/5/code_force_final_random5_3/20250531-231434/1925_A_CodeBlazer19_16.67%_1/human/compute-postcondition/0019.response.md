The only variables in the loop head are variable j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, j is k + 96 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to j is 97 and k is greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, k is greater than 0, s is an empty string, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers, j is 97**
