Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 2, `s` is a string containing three characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is 99**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending the character 'c' (which is the ASCII character corresponding to the integer 99) to the original string 'ab'. The other variables remain unchanged.
