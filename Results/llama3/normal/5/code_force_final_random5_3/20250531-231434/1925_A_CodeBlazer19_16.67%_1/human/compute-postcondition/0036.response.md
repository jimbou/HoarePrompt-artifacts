Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 1, `s` is a string containing one character, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is at least 97**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to contain one character, which is the character represented by the ASCII value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers.
