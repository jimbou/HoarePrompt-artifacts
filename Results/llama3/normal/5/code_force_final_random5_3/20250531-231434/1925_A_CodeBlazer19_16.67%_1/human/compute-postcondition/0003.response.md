According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is at least 1 and `j` is now 97.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `s` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `j` is 97**
