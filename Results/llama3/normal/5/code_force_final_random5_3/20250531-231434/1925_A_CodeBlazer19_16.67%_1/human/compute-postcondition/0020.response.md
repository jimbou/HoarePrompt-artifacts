Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, k is greater than 0, s is a string containing one character 'a', stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers, j is 97**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains the same, which is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive). The value of i is still 1. The value of n is still an integer. The value of k is still greater than 0. The value of s has changed to a string containing one character 'a'. The stdin still contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers. The value of j is still 97.
