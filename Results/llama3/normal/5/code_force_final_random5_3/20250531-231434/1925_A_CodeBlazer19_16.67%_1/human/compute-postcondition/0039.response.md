To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `k + 97`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is at least 98. To execute the loop again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes at least 99.

Since `k` is an integer that must be at least 2, and the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `k + 97`, we can conclude that `k` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 3, `s` is a string containing two characters, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is at least 99**
