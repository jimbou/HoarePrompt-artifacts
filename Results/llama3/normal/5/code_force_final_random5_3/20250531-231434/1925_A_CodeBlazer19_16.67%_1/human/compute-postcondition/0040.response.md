Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 3, `s` is a string containing three characters, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is at least 99**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to a string containing three characters by appending the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the original string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-6` lines of input, each with two integers.
