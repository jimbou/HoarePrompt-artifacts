The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 97`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 98, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 (to 99) and `k` must be greater than 2 (so that `k + 97` is greater than 99).
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 2, `s` is a string containing two characters 'a' and 'b', stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is 99**
