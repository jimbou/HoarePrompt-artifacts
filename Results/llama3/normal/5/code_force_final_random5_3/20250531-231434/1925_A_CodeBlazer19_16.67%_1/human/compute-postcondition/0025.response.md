Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a string containing k characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value k + 96, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers, j is k + 96**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` will contain `k` characters starting from 'a' and ending at the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is `k + 96` after the loop finishes executing.
