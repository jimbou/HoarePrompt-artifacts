Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `s` is a string containing three characters 'abc', `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `j` is 99**

The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 99, the character 'c' is appended to `s`, resulting in the string 'abc'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
