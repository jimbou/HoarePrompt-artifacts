Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a string containing k characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value k + 96, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers, j is k + 96. If k is 1, a string of n characters is printed, where each character is the character represented by the ASCII value 1 + 96, repeated n times. If k is not 1, the string s is printed twice if n is not equal to 1, otherwise, the string s is printed once.***
