To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for j in range(97, k + 97):`.

From the given state, we know that `j` is at least 97. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` should be at least 98.

The only other object in the loop head is `k`, which is an integer that must be at least 1. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 97`. Since `j` is at least 98, `k + 97` must be greater than 98, which means `k` must be at least 2.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string containing one character, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is at least 98**
