To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already given to be an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, to make it explicit and to adjust the state of `i`, we can specify that `i` starts at 0, which is the typical starting point for a range-based loop in Python.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.**
