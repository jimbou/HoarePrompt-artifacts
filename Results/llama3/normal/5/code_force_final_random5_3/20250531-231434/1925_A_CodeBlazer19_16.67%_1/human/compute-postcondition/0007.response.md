To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for j in range(97, k + 97):`.

From the given state, we know that `j` is currently 98. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 99.

The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 97`. Since `j` is now 99, `k + 97` must be greater than 99 for the loop to continue. This implies that `k` must be at least 3 (since 3 + 97 = 100, which is greater than 99).

The other variables in the state (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `stdin`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `s` is a string containing two characters 'ab', `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `j` is 99**
