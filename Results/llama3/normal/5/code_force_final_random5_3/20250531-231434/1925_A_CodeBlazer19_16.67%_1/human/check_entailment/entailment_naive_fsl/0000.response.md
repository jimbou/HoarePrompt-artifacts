Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 2 and k = 3, the program prints "abcbac", but this string does not contain all possible substrings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets as subsequences. Specifically, it does not contain the substring "ca" as a subsequence.

The program only repeats the string "abc" twice, but it does not consider all possible permutations of the characters. To fix this, the program should generate all possible permutations of the characters and concatenate them to form the final string.

Here is an example of a correct program:
```
import itertools

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        chars = [chr(j) for j in range(97, k + 97)]
        perms = [''.join(p) for p in itertools.permutations(chars, n)]
        s = ''.join(perms)
        print(s)
```
This program uses the `itertools.permutations` function to generate all possible permutations of the characters, and then concatenates them to form the final string.
