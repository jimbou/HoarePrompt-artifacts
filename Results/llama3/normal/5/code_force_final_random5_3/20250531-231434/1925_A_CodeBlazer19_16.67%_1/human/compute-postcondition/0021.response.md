The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and k. If j is less than k+97, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 97, k is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time j is 98 and k must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, k is greater than 1, s is a string containing one character 'a', stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers, j is 98**
