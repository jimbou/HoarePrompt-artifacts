Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `j` is `k + 96`. If `k` is 1, a string of 'n' repetitions of the character 'a' is printed. If `k` is not 1, either 2 times the string `s` or the string `s` is printed, depending on whether `n` is equal to 1 or not.***
