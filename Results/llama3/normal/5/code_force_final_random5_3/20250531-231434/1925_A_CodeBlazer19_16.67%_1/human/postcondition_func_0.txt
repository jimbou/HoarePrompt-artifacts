This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and then reads t pairs of integers n and k. For each pair, it constructs a string s containing k characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value k + 96. If k is 1, it prints a string of n repetitions of the character 'a'. If k is not 1, it prints either 2 times the string s or the string s, depending on whether n is equal to 1 or not. After processing all test cases, the function leaves stdin empty.
