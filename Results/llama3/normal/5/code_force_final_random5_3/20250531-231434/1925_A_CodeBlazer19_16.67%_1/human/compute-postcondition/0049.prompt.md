Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = ''
    for j in range(97, k + 97):
        s += chr(j)
    if k == 1:
        print(n * s)
    else:
        print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string containing `k` characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value `k + 96`, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `j` is `k + 96`. If `k` is 1, a string of 'n' repetitions of the character 'a' is printed. If `k` is not 1, either 2 times the string `s` or the string `s` is printed, depending on whether `n` is equal to 1 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a string containing k characters from 'a' to the character represented by the ASCII value k + 96, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers, j is k + 96. If k is 1, a string of n characters is printed, where each character is the character represented by the ASCII value 1 + 96, repeated n times. If k is not 1, the string s is printed twice if n is not equal to 1, otherwise, the string s is printed once.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string containing `k` characters, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is `k + 96`. If `k` is 1, the string `s` repeated `n` times is being printed. If `k` is not 1, `(2 - (n == 1)) * s` is printed, which is equal to 2 times the string `s` if `n` is not equal to 1, or 1 times the string `s` if `n` is equal to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
