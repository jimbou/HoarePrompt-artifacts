Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a string containing `k` characters, `stdin` contains `t-6` lines of input, each containing two integers, `j` is `k + 96`. If `k` is 1, the string `s` repeated `n` times is being printed. If `k` is not 1, `(2 - (n == 1)) * s` is printed, which is equal to 2 times the string `s` if `n` is not equal to 1, or 1 times the string `s` if `n` is equal to 1.***
