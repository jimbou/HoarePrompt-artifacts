To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(97, k + 97):`. The objects involved are `j` and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 97. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 98.

The value of `k` is at least 1, but its exact value is not specified. However, since `j` is in the range `97` to `k + 97`, we know that `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we can keep the state of `k` as "at least 1".

The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `s` is a string containing a single character 'a', `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `j` is 98**
