Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `s` is a string containing a single character 'a', `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `j` is 97**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to contain a single character 'a', which is the result of `chr(j)` where `j` is 97. The other variables remain unchanged.
