Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers, `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `good_subarrays` is 1, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the first `m` elements of list `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each common element between the first `m` elements of list `a` and list `b`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged, the value of `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1, the frequency of elements in list `b` and the first `m` elements of list `a` remain unchanged, the number of matches between the first `m` elements of list `a` and list `b` remains the same, and the value of `i` remains 0. The condition that the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k` still holds.
