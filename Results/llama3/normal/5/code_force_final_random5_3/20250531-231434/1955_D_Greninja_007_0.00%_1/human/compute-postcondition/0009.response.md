Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers, `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the first `m` elements of list `a` minus one occurrence of `a[i]`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each common element between the first `m` elements of list `a` and list `b` minus the minimum frequency of `a[i]`, if `a[i]` is in `b_freq`, `good_subarrays` is 1 if `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `good_subarrays` is 0. The current value of `window_freq[a[i]]` is 0.**
