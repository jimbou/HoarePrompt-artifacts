Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers, `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the first `m` elements of list `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each common element between the first `m` elements of list `a` and list `b` minus the minimum frequency of `a[i]`, `i` is 0. If the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `good_subarrays` is 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains 0. The current value of `a[i]` is in `b_freq`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `matches` has been decreased by the minimum frequency of `a[i]` in both the first `m` elements of list `a` and list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `good_subarrays` is still dependent on the current value of `matches` and `k`.
