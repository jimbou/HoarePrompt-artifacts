Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers, `k` is an integer, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `good_subarrays` is 0, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the first `m` elements of list `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each common element between the first `m` elements of list `a` and list `b`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
