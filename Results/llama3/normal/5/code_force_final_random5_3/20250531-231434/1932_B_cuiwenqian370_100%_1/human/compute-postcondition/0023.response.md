To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`). 

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`T` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1 + n + n, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `next_year` and the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `next_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`)**
