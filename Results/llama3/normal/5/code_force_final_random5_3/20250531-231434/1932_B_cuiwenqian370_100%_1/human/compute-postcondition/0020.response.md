Output State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1 + n, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `next_year` and the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`), `i` is `n` - 1, `next_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` remains unchanged, `index` remains the same, `results` now contains two string representations of years, `_` is still 1, `n` is still an integer and is at least `n`, `a` is still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` and `next_year` are still integers between 1 and 10^6 and are equal to the given expressions, and `i` is still `n` - 1.
