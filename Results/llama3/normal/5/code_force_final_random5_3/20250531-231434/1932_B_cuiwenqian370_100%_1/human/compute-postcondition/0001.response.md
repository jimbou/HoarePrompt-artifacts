The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If T is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). So for the loop to be executed  the T must be greater than 0 and _ is now 0.
State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), T must be greater than 0, _ is 0**
