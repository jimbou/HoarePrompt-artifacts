Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), T must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of T remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 1000. The index variable has been incremented by the value of n (which is between 1 and 100) plus 1, so its new value is 1 + n + 1. The results list is still empty. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case, but the first input (an integer n) and the following n integers have been consumed by the code. The value of T is still greater than 0, and the value of _ is still 0. The variable n has been assigned an integer value between 1 and 100. The variable a is now a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^6. The variable last_year has been assigned the first element of the list a, which is an integer between 1 and 10^6.
