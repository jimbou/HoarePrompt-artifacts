According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2. Also, `i` is not initialized before the loop, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1.

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100), then `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, `i` is 1**
