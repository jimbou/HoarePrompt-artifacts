Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least n, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), `i` is n - 1, `next_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now contains the string representation of the value of `last_year`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^6. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case.
