Output State: **T is an integer between 3 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n + n, results is a list containing the string representation of next_year and the string representation of last_year, _ is 2, n is an integer and is at least n, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to a[0], i is n - 1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]).**

The code block modifies the values of `n`, `index`, `a`, and `last_year`. The first line assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `n`, which is at least `n`. The second line increments `index` by 1. The third line assigns a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]` to `a`. The fourth line increments `index` by `n`. The fifth line assigns the first element of `a` to `last_year`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^6. The values of `T`, `results`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `next_year` is still equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`), but `last_year` is now `a[0]`.
