Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), T must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is 1**

The code calculates the next year based on the last year and the current value of `a[i]`, then updates the last year to be the next year. The value of `last_year` is updated to be the ceiling of `(last_year + 1) / a[i]` multiplied by `a[i]`, which means it is rounded up to the nearest multiple of `a[i]`. No other variables are affected by the code.
