To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(T):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the value of `_` is less than `T`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `T` is an integer between 2 and 1000.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `T` remains the same, but since `_` is now 2, `T` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`index`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `last_year`, `i`, and `next_year`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1 + n, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `next_year` and the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`), `i` is `n` - 1, `next_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`).**
