Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

The program initializes the last_year variable to the first periodicity and then iterates through the remaining periodicities. For each periodicity, it calculates the next_year as the smallest multiple of the current periodicity that is greater than or equal to the previous last_year plus one. This is done using the formula (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i], which effectively rounds up the last_year to the nearest multiple of a[i].

The program then updates the last_year to the calculated next_year and repeats this process for all periodicities. Finally, it appends the last_year to the results list and writes the results to standard output, one per line.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. The program correctly handles the case where the next sign occurs immediately after the previous one, as well as the case where there is a gap between the two signs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
