Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least n, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is n - 1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])**.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, so after the loop finishes, i will be equal to n-1. The value of last_year will be the result of the last iteration of the loop, which is ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]). The value of next_year will also be the same as last_year, since it is assigned the value of last_year in the last iteration of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
