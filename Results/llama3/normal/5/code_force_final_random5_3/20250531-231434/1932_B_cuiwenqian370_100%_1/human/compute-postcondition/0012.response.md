Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least n, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to a[0], i is n - 1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n - 1 integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_(n-1) (1 <= a_i <= 10^6)**

The code executes as follows: The first line assigns the integer value of the input at index to n. The second line increments index by 1. The third line assigns a list of n integers from the input at index to a. The fourth line increments index by n. The fifth line assigns the first element of a to last_year. 

The value of n is updated to the integer value of the input at index. The value of index is incremented by n + 1. The value of a is updated to a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6. The value of last_year is updated to the first element of a. The value of i is not updated and remains n - 1. The value of next_year is not updated and remains ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]). The value of stdin is updated to contain multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n - 1 integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_(n-1) (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
