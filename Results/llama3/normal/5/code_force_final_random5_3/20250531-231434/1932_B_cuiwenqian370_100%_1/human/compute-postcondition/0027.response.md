To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, n):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer and is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables in the state (`T`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `a`, `last_year`, and `next_year`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`T` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1 + n + n, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `next_year` and the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`), `i` is 3, `next_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`)**
