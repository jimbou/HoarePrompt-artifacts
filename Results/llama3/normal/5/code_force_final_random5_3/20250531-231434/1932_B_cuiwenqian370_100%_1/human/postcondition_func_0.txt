This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates the last year after a series of increments, where each increment is the smallest multiple of the current year's increment that is greater than or equal to the previous year's last year plus one. The function returns a list of the last years for each test case, with each result as a string, and writes the results to standard output, one per line.
