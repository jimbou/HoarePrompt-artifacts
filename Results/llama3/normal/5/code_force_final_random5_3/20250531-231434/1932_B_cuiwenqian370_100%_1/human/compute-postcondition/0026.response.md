Output State: **T is an integer between 3 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n + n, results is a list containing the string representation of next_year and the string representation of last_year, _ is 2, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is 2, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])**

The code snippet provided updates the values of `next_year` and `last_year` based on the current values of `last_year`, `a[i]`, and the mathematical operations performed. The first line calculates a new value for `next_year` using the formula `((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])`, and the second line assigns this new value to `last_year`. 

As a result, both `next_year` and `last_year` will have the same value after the code executes, which is the calculated value from the first line. The rest of the variables (`T`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
