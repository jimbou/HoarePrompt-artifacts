According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 1. 

State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to a[0], i is 1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])**
