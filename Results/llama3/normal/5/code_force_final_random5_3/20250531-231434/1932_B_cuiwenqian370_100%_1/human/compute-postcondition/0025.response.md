To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we know it must be at least 2.

State: **`T` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1 + n + n, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `next_year` and the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`), `i` is 2, `next_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`)**
