Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.

The program first reads the input data from the standard input, which includes the number of test cases (T), the number of signs (n) for each test case, and the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

The program then iterates over each test case, initializing the last_year variable to the periodicity of the first sign (a[0]). It then iterates over the remaining signs, calculating the next_year variable as the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the last_year. The last_year variable is then updated to the next_year.

Finally, the program appends the string representation of the last_year to the results list and writes the results to the standard output.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The use of integer division and multiplication to calculate the next_year ensures that the result is accurate and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
