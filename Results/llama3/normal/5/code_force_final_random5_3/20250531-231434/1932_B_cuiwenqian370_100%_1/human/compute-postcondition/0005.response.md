The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), T must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is 2**
