Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n + ... + n (n times), results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is n-1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has processed all the test cases, and the results are stored in the `results` list. The `index` variable has been updated to point to the end of the input data. The `last_year` and `next_year` variables hold the final values calculated by the loop. The `i` variable is still at `n-1`, indicating that the loop has finished processing the last test case. The `stdin` still contains the input data, but it is no longer being processed by the loop.
