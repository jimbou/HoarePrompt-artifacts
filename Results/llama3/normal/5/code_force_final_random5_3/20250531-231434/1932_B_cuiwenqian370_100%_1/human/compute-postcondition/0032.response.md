Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n + ... + n (n times), results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is n-1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and the string representation of the list results is printed to the standard output.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the string representation of the list results is printed to the standard output. The values of the variables T, index, results, last_year, i, and next_year remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case.
