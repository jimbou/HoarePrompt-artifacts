Output State: **T is an integer between 3 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n + n, results is a list containing the string representation of next_year and the string representation of last_year, _ is 2, n is an integer and is at least n, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1])**.

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The loop has iterated over the entire list 'a', and the 'last_year' and 'next_year' variables have been updated to reflect the values calculated in the last iteration. The 'i' variable has reached its final value of 'n-1', indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
