The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least n, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), `i` is n - 1, `next_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6)**
