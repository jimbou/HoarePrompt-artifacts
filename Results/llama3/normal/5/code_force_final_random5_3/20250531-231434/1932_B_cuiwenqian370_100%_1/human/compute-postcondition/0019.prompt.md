Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least n, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to a[0], i is n - 1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n - 1 integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_(n-1) (1 <= a_i <= 10^6)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
    last_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is 1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n, results is a list containing the string representation of next_year, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is 2, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is an integer between 2 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n, results is a list containing the string representation of next_year, _ is 1, n is an integer and is at least 4, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is 3, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
