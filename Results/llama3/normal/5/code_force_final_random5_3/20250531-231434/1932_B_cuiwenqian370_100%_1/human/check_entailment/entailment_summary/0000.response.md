Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, calculates the last year for each test case, and writes the results to standard output.

The program's logic is correct. It initializes the last year with the periodicity of the first sign and then iterates over the remaining signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year by finding the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than or equal to the previous year's last year plus one. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which is mathematically correct.

The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading the test cases from standard input and writing the results to standard output, one per line.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
