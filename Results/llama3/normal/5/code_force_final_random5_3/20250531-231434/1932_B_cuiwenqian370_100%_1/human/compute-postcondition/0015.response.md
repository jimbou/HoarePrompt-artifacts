To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, n):`

The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`T`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `a`, `last_year`, and `next_year`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `index` is 1 + n + 1 + n, `results` is a list containing the string representation of last_year, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, `last_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), `i` is 2, `next_year` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])**
