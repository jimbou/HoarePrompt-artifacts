Output State: **T is an integer between 3 and 1000, index is 1 + n + 1 + n + n, results is a list containing the string representation of next_year, the string representation of last_year, and the string representation of last_year, _ is 2, n is an integer and is at least n, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6, last_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1, next_year is an integer between 1 and 10^6 and is equal to ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1])**.

The code appends the string representation of last_year to the results list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The results list now contains three elements: the string representation of next_year, the string representation of last_year, and the string representation of last_year.
