Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 100), then n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

Explanation: The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings. It then extracts the first integer value from the list, which is the number of test cases T, and increments the index to point to the next input. The results list is initialized as an empty list. The remaining inputs in stdin are left unchanged, waiting for further processing in subsequent code.
