Output State: **t is a positive integer, i is 0, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**

The code snippet reads two inputs from stdin: a positive integer `n` and a string `arr` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The value of `n` is assigned to the variable `n`, and the string `arr` is assigned to the variable `arr`. The variables `t`, `i`, and `results` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
