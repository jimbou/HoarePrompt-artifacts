Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing 'yes', `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" with an odd number of 'U's, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**

In natural language, the output state is that the number of test cases `t` remains the same, the counter `i` is still 0, the list `results` now contains the string 'yes', the length of the string `arr` is still `n` which is between 1 and 100, and `arr` still contains only "U" and "D" with an odd number of 'U's. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case, where each test case has two inputs: a positive integer and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
