To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which is the variable `i` and the list `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. Since `i` is used as the loop variable, it will take on the value of each element in the list `results` during each iteration.

Given the initial state, we know that `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no'. For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least 1 element. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in the list `results`, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains no test cases**
