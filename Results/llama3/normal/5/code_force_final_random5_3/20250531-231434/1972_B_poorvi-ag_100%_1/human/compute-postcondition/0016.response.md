The code appends 'no' to the results list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The results list now contains either 'yes' or 'no' with two more 'no's if the count of 'U' in the input string is odd, otherwise two more 'no's. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' with two more 'no's, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
