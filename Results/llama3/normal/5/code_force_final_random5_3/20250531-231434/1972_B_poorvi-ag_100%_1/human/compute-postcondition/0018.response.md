Output State: **t is a positive integer, i is t-1, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains no test cases. If the count of 'U' in arr is odd, results contains 'yes', otherwise results contains 'no'.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` remains a positive integer, `i` is now equal to `t-1`, and `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each test case. The variable `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `arr` is still a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The standard input `stdin` is now empty, as all test cases have been processed. The list `results` contains 'yes' for each test case where the count of 'U' in the input string is odd, and 'no' otherwise.
