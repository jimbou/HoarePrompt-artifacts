The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` has one more 'yes' than before. Otherwise, `results` has one more 'no' than before.**
