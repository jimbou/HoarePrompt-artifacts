The code `results.append('yes')` adds the string 'yes' to the end of the list `results`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' and now it has one more 'yes' than before, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
