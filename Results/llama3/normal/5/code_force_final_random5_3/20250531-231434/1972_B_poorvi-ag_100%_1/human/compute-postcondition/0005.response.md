Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, i is 0, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". The number of "U"s in arr is even***
