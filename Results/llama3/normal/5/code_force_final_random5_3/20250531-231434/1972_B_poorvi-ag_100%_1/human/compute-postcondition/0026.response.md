The code prints the third element in the list `results`.
Since the exact elements in the list `results` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'yes' or 'no'.
Output: **either 'yes' or 'no' (where 'yes' or 'no' is the third element in the list results)**
