Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `arr`, which is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". 

Since `n` and `arr` are assigned new values, their previous values are overwritten. The values of `t`, `i`, and `results` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by one.
