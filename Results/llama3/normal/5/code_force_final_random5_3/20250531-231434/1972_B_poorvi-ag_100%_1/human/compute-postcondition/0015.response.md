Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' with two more 'yes' if the count of 'U' in the input string is odd, otherwise two more 'no', `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 2. The value of `i` remains 2. The list `results` now contains two more 'yes' if the count of 'U' in the input string is odd, otherwise two more 'no'. The value of `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100. The string `arr` remains of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
