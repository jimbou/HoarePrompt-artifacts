To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in results:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, and the second element of the list is being printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `results` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` should be the third element in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is the third element in the list `results`, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains no test cases**
