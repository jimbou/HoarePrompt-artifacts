Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, i is t-1, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains no test cases. If the count of 'U' in arr is odd, results contains 'yes', otherwise results contains 'no'.
Code of the loop:
for i in results:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is the first element in the list `results`, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least 1 element, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains no test cases, and the first element of the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is the second element in the list `results`, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains no test cases, and the second element of the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is the third element in the list `results`, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains no test cases, and the third element of the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
