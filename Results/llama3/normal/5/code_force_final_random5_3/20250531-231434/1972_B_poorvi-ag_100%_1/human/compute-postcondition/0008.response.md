The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 100) and then a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". If the number of 'U's in `arr` is odd, `results` contains 'yes', otherwise `results` contains 'no'.**
