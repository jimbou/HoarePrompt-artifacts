Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing one string 'no', `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". The number of "U"s in `arr` is even**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer, `i` is still 0, `results` now contains one string 'no', `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is still a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and the number of "U"s in `arr` is still even. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case, with each test case containing two inputs: a positive integer and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
