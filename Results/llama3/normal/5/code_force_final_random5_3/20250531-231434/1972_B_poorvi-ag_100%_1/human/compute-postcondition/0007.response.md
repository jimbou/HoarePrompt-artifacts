Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, i is 0, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". If the number of 'U's in arr is odd, results contains 'yes', otherwise results contains 'no'.***
