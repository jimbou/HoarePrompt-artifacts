Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If the count of 'U' in arr is odd, results has one more 'yes' than before. Otherwise, results has one more 'no' than before.***
