Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, i is 0, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". If the number of 'U's in arr is odd, results contains 'yes', otherwise results contains 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If the count of 'U' in arr is odd, results has one more 'yes' than before. Otherwise, results has one more 'no' than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, arr is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no'. If the count of 'U' in the input string is odd, results contains two more 'yes'. Otherwise, results contains two more 'no'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
