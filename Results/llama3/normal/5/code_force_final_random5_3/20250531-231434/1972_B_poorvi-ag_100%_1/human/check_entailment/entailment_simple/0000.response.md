Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The program uses a simple approach to determine the winner. It counts the number of 'U's (facing-up coins) in the input string. If the count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This approach is correct because the game is symmetric, and the players alternate turns. If there are an odd number of facing-up coins, Alice will always have a move available, while Bob will eventually run out of moves.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases, the number of coins, and the string of coin states, and printing the results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
