Output State: **t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is a positive integer, it now holds the number of test cases. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected.
