To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so `t` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, because the loop starts from 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**
