Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' and an additional 'no', `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is still 1, `results` now contains an additional 'no' besides either 'yes' or 'no', `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is still a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
