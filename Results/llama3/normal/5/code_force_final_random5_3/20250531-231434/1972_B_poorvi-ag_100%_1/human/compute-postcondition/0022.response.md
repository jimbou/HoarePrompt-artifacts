To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `results`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `results` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is the second element in the list `results`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is the second element in the list `results`, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `arr` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `stdin` contains no test cases, and the second element of the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed**
