Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines whether the count of 'U' in the string is odd or even and appends 'yes' or 'no' to a results list accordingly. Finally, it prints all elements in the results list.**
