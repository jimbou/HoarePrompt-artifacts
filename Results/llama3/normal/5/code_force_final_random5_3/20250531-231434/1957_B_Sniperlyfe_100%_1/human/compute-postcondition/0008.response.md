The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to its original value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` > 0, the second element of `nums` is set to `min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k)`, the third element is the minimum of the first element plus one and `k`, and the rest are 0. If `k` is 0, the list remains unchanged. `i` is 3**
