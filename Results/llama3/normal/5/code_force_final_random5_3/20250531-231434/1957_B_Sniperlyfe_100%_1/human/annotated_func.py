#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are the minimum of the first element plus one and k.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k and the rest are the minimum of the first element plus one and k.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function generates a list of n integers based on the input parameters n and k. It initializes the first element of the list to the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits minus one, and then distributes the remaining value of k across the rest of the list, capping each element at the minimum of the first element plus one and the remaining value of k. The function returns this list, with the first element incremented by the remaining value of k.
