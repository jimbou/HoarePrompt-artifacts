The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to its original value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest are 0, `i` is 2. If `k` > 0, the second element of `nums` is set to `min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k)`**
