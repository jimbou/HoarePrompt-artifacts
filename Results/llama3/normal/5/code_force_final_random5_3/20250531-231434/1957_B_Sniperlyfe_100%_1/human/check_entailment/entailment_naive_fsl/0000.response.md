Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it successfully constructs a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

The function `func_1` works by first initializing the first element of the sequence to the maximum possible value that can be achieved with k bits, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is chosen because it has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

Then, the function iterates over the remaining elements of the sequence, assigning each element the minimum value between the first element plus one and the remaining sum k. This ensures that the sum of the sequence does not exceed k.

Finally, the function adds the remaining sum k to the first element of the sequence, ensuring that the sum of the sequence equals k.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including edge cases where n is 1 or k is 0. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
