To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we need to adjust its value to be at least 2.

The variable `i` is initialized to 1, so we don't need to adjust its value.

The state of `k` and `nums` are not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to its original value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest are 0, `i` is 1**
