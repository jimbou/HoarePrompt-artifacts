Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are the minimum of the first element plus one and k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, the value of `k` becomes 0, and the list `nums` is updated such that the first element remains the same, and the rest of the elements are set to the minimum of the first element plus one and the original value of `k`.
