Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k and the rest are the minimum of the first element plus one and k.**

In this output state, the value of `nums[0]` has been updated to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, which is the result of adding `k` to the original value of `nums[0]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the rest of the elements in the `nums` list are still the minimum of the first element plus one and `k`.
