Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to its original value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` > 0, the second element of `nums` is set to `min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k)`, the third element is the minimum of the first element plus one and `k`, and the rest are 0. If `k` is 0, the list remains unchanged. `i` is 2.***
