Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to its original value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest are 0, `i` is 1. If `k` > 0, the second element of `nums` is set to `min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k)`.***
