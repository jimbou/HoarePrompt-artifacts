In natural language, the program returns the sum of the frequency of each unique stick length in `arr` divided by 3, rounded down to the nearest whole number. The frequency of each unique stick length is stored in the dictionary `freq`, where each key is a unique element of `arr` and the value is the frequency of that element in `arr`. The list `arr` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` takes the value of the last element of `arr`.
