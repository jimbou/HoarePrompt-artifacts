Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, where each integer represents the length of a stick and is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, where the key is `n` and the value is 1.**

In this output state, the code has updated the `freq` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair. The key is `n`, which is the first element of the `arr` list, and the value is 1, indicating that the length `n` appears once in the list. The other variables, `arr` and `n`, remain unchanged.
