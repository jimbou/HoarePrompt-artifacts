This function calculates the total number of sets of three sticks that can be formed from a given list of stick lengths, where each stick length is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It takes a list of integers as input, counts the frequency of each unique stick length, and returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3, effectively calculating the total number of sets of three sticks that can be formed. The input list remains unchanged.
