To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `n` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `arr` is a list of integers representing stick lengths, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), we can adjust the state of `arr` to have at least 1 element.

The variable `n` is the loop variable, which will take on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration. Since `arr` has at least 1 element, we can adjust the state of `n` to be the first element of `arr`.

The state of `freq` is not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, where each integer represents the length of a stick and is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is an empty dictionary**
