Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where each integer represents the length of a stick and is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is the third element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, where the key is the previous value of `n` and the value is 3**

In this output state, the value of `freq[n]` has been updated to 3, since the previous value of `n` was already a key in the `freq` dictionary with a value of 2, and the code increments this value by 1. The other variables, `arr` and `n`, remain unchanged.
