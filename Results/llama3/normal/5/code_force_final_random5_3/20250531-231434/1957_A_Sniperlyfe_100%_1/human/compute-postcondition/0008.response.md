Output State: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where each integer represents the length of a stick and is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is the last element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, where each key is a unique element of `arr` and the value is the frequency of that element in `arr`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is that the list `arr` remains unchanged, the variable `n` takes the value of the last element of `arr`, and the dictionary `freq` contains the frequency of each unique element in `arr`.
