Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, where each integer represents the length of a stick and is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is the second element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair, where the key is the previous value of `n` and the value is 1, and the value of `n` in `freq` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of stick lengths and the value of `n` remain the same, but the frequency of `n` in the dictionary `freq` is increased by 1.
