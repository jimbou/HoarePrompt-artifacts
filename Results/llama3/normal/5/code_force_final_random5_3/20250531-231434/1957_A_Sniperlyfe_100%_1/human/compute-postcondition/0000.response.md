Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing integers representing stick lengths between 1 and 100. A new variable `freq` has been introduced, which is an empty dictionary. This dictionary is likely intended to store the frequency of each stick length, but since no values have been added to it yet, it remains empty.
