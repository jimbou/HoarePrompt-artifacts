Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick and is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `arr` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the input list `arr`, and its corresponding value is the number of times that stick length appears in `arr`. The list `arr` remains unchanged.
