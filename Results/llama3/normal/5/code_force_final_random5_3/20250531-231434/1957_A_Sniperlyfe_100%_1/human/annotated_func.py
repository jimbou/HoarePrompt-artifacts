#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where each integer represents the length of a stick and is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is the last element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with key-value pairs, where each key is a unique element of `arr` and the value is the frequency of that element in `arr`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is that the list `arr` remains unchanged, the variable `n` takes the value of the last element of `arr`, and the dictionary `freq` contains the frequency of each unique element in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length in `arr` by 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the total number of sets of three sticks that can be formed from a given list of stick lengths, where each stick length is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It takes a list of integers as input, counts the frequency of each unique stick length, and returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3, effectively calculating the total number of sets of three sticks that can be formed. The input list remains unchanged.
