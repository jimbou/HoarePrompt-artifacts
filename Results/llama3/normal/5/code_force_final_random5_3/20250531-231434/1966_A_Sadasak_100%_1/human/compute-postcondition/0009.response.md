Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the second integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key. If the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, then the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is increased by 1.***
