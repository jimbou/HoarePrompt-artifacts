Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `arr` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from the input list `arr`, and each value represents the frequency of that integer in `arr`. However, if the frequency of any integer exceeds the value of `k`, the frequency will be capped at `k`. The input list `arr` and the integer `k` remain unchanged.
