Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key and its count is `k`, `num` is the first integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been updated to `k`, which means the count of the first integer `num` in the list `arr` is now `k`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `arr` still being a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` still being an integer between 2 and 100, and `num` still being the first integer in the list.
