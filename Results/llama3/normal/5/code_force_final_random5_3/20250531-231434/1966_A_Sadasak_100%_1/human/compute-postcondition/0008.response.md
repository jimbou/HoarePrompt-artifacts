Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the second integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key and the count of `num` is set to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` is updated to `k`, regardless of its previous value. The other variables, `arr` and `k`, remain unchanged. The precondition that `arr` has at least 2 integers and `k` is between 2 and 100 (inclusive) still holds.
