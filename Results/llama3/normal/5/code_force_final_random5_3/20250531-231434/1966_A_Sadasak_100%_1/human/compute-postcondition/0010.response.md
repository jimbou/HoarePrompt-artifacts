To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `arr`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers.
2. The loop iterates over each integer `num` in the list `arr`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more integer in the list `arr` that hasn't been processed yet.
4. Since `num` is the current integer being processed, it will be the next integer in the list `arr` at the start of the next iteration.


State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the third integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key. If the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, then the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is increased by 1.**
