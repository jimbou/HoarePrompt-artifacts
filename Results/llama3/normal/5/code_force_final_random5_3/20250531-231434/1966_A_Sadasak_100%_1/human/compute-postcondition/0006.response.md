To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for num in arr:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `num` and `arr`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 integers.

The state of `num` is not explicitly mentioned, but since it is the loop variable, we can assume it is the first integer in the list `arr` at the start of the loop.

The state of `k` and `frequency_table` is not relevant to the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the second integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key. If the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, then the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`.**

Note that we have not changed the state of `k` or `frequency_table`, only the state of `arr` and `num`.
