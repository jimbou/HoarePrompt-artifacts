The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the first integer `num` in the list `arr`. The `get` method is used to retrieve the current count of `num` in the dictionary, defaulting to 0 if it's not present. The count is then incremented by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key and its count is 1, `num` is the first integer in the list**
