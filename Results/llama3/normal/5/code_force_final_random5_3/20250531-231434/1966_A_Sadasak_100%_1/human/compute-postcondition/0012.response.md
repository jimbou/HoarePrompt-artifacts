Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the third integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key, and the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been updated to `k`, regardless of its previous value. The other variables, `arr` and `k`, remain unchanged. The list `arr` still has at least 3 integers, and the value of `k` is still between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The dictionary `frequency_table` still has the third integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key, but its count has been set to `k`.
