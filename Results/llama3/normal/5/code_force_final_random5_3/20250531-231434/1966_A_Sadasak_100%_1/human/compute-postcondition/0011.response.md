The value of `frequency_table[num]` is increased by 1, but if the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, then the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Since `num` is the third integer in the list `arr`, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is increased by 1, unless it is already larger than `k`, in which case it is set to `k`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the third integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key, and the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is either increased by 1 or set to `k` if it was already larger than `k`.**
