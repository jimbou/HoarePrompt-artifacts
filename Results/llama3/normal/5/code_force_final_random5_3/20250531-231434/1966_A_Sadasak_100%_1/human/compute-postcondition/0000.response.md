Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code only introduces a new variable `frequency_table` and assigns it an empty dictionary. The constraints on `k` (2 <= k <= 100) are still valid, as the code does not affect `k`.
