Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the second integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key. If the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is larger than `k`, then the count of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. The count of `num` in `frequency_table` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` still has at least 2 integers, the value of `k` is still between 2 and 100, and the dictionary `frequency_table` still has the second integer `num` in the list `arr` as a key. However, the count of `num` in `frequency_table` has been increased by 1. If this count is larger than `k`, it is set to `k`.
