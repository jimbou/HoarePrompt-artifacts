To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only object in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates `t` times.

State: **`array` is a list of non-negative integers, `t` is an integer that must be greater than 0 and is one less than its previous value, `index` is 1 plus n, `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(array), `stdin` is empty**
