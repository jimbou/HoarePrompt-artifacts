To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is one less than its previous value and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be one less than its current value, which means it must be greater than 0.

The variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so its value does not affect the execution of the loop.

The other variables `array`, `index`, `results`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be greater than 0 and is one less than its current value, index is 1 plus n plus the original value of n, results is a list containing two elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to the original and new values of array, stdin is empty**
