Output State: **`array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1 plus the sum of all n values, `results` is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to all values of array, `result` is the last element of results, `stdin` is empty, and the last element of results which is the result of func_1(array) applied to the last value of array is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the program is such that the array remains unchanged, the value of `t` is still greater than 0, the index remains the same, and the results list is still populated with the results of applying `func_1` to each element of the array. The loop variable `result` now holds the last element of the results list, and the last result (which is the result of applying `func_1` to the last element of the array) is being printed. The standard input (`stdin`) remains empty.
