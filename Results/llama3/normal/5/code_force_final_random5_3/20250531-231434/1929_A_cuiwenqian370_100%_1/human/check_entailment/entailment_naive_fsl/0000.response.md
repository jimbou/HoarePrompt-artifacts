Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` sorts the input array in ascending order and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order.

The function `func_2` reads the input from the standard input, processes the test cases, and prints the results. It correctly handles the input format and calls the `func_1` function to calculate the beauty of each array.

The program correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem description, and it is not possible to find a counterexample where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
