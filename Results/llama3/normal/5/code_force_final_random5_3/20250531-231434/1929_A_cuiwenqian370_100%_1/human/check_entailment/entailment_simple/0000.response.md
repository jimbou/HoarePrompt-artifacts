Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Function 1 sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is a correct approach because sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty.

Function 2 reads the input data, calls Function 1 for each test case, and prints the results. The input data is read correctly, and the results are printed as required.

However, there is a logical error in Function 1. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, but the problem statement defines the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, not the absolute differences. This means that the beauty can be negative if the array is not sorted in ascending order.

To fix this error, Function 1 should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, not the absolute differences. The corrected code for Function 1 would be:

    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty

With this correction, the program is correct.

Correctness: **False** (due to the logical error in Function 1)
