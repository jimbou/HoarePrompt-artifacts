According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results. If the results have at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 2 elements, result is the second element of results, index is 1 plus the sum of all n values, array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the second element of results which is the result of func_1(array) applied to the second value of array is being printed, and the result which is the second element of results is being printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the results must have at least 3 elements and the result is the third element of results.
State: **`array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1 plus the sum of all n values, `results` is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to all values of array, `result` is the third element of results, `stdin` is empty, and the third element of results which is the result of func_1(array) applied to the third value of array is being printed, and the result which is the third element of results is being printed**
