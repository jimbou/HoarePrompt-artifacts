The `print(result)` statement will print the second element of the `results` list, which is the result of `func_1(array)` applied to the second value of the `array`.

Since the exact values of `array` and the function `func_1` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of applying `func_1` to the second value of `array`.

Output: **the result of func_1(array) applied to the second value of array**
