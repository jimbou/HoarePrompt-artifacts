Output State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be greater than 0 and is one less than its previous value, index is 1 plus n plus the original value of n, results is a list containing two elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to the original and new values of array, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `array` has been updated to a new list of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is the value read from `data` at the current `index`. The value of `index` has been incremented by `n` to point to the next set of data. The `results` list now contains two elements, the original result of `func_1(array)` applied to the original value of `array`, and the new result of `func_1(array)` applied to the new value of `array`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `stdin` remains empty, as it was initially empty.
