Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Function 1 sorts the input list in ascending order and then computes the sum of the absolute differences between adjacent elements. This is a correct approach to find the maximum beauty of the array, as sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of non-negative integers, applies Function 1 to each list, and prints the results. This is a correct approach to handle multiple test cases and print the results.

The program correctly implements the problem description, and the functions work together to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
