Output State: **array is a list of non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be greater than 0, index is 1 plus n, results is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(array), stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `array` is a list of non-negative integers, which is the same as the initial state. The value of `t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, which is also the same as the initial state. The value of `index` is 1 plus `n`, where `n` is the value of `data[index]`. The value of `results` is a list containing one element, which is the result of `func_1(array)`. The value of `stdin` is empty, which is the same as the initial state.
