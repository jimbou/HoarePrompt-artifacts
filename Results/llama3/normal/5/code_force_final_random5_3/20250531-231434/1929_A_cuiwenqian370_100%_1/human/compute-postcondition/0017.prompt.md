Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is 0, index is 1 plus the sum of all n values, results is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to all values of array, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1 plus the sum of all n values, `results` is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to all values of array, `result` is the first element of results, `stdin` is empty, and the first element of results which is the result of func_1(array) applied to the first value of array is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1 plus the sum of all n values, `results` is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to all values of array, `result` is the second element of results, `stdin` is empty, and the second element of results which is the result of func_1(array) applied to the second value of array is being printed, and the result which is the second element of results is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1 plus the sum of all n values, `results` is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to all values of array, `result` is the third element of results, `stdin` is empty, and the third element of results which is the result of func_1(array) applied to the third value of array is being printed, and the result which is the third element of results is being printed, and the result which is the third element of results is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
