Output State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is an integer that must be greater than 0 and is one less than its current value, index is 1 plus n plus the original value of n plus n, results is a list containing three elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to the original and new values of array and the new value of array, stdin is empty**

The code first assigns the integer value at `data[index]` to `n`. Then, it increments `index` by 1. Next, it assigns a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]` to `array`. After that, it increments `index` by `n`. The code then calls `func_1(array)` and appends the result to `results`. 

The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `index` is incremented by `n` twice, so it becomes 1 plus `n` plus the original value of `n` plus `n`. The value of `array` is updated to a list of `n` non-negative integers. The value of `results` is updated to a list containing three elements which are the results of `func_1(array)` applied to the original and new values of `array` and the new value of `array`. The state of `stdin` remains empty as it is not affected by the code.
