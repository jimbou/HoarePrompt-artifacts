To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `result` and the list `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `results` is a list containing `t` elements, which are the results of `func_1(array)` applied to all values of `array`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Additionally, since `result` is the variable that will take on the value of each element in the `results` list during each iteration, we need to ensure that `result` is initialized to the first element of the `results` list.

The other variables, `array`, `index`, and `stdin`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1 plus the sum of all n values, `results` is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to all values of array, `result` is the first element of results, `stdin` is empty**
