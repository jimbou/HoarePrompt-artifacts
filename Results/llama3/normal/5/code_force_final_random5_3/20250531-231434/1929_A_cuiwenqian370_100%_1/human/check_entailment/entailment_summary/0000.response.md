Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

Function `func_1` calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list of integers. This function is correct because it sorts the input list in ascending order and then computes the sum of the absolute differences between adjacent elements, which is equivalent to the beauty of the array.

Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of non-negative integers, applies the `func_1` function to each list, and prints the results. This function is also correct because it correctly reads the input, processes it, and applies the `func_1` function to each list.

Since both functions are correct and work together to solve the problem, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
