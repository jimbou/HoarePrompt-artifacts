The only variable in the loop head is variable  result, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results. If the results have at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, results have at least 1 element, result is the first element of results. So for the loop to be executed one more time the results must have at least 2 elements and the result is the second element of results.
State: **`array` is a list of n non-negative integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1 plus the sum of all n values, `results` is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to all values of array, `result` is the second element of results, `stdin` is empty, and the second element of results which is the result of func_1(array) applied to the second value of array is being printed**
