Reasoning:

1. The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes an array as input, sorts it, and calculates the beauty of the array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

3. `func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

4. The key insight to the problem is that the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by sorting the array in ascending order. This is because the beauty of the array is maximized when the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which occurs when the smallest element is followed by the largest element, the second smallest element is followed by the second largest element, and so on.

5. The given program correctly implements this insight by sorting the array in `func_1` and then calculating the beauty of the array.

6. The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.

7. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
