Output State: **array is a list of n non-negative integers, t is 0, index is 1 plus the sum of all n values, results is a list containing t elements which are the results of func_1(array) applied to all values of array, stdin is empty**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The array will still be a list of non-negative integers, but its value will be the last value it was assigned during the loop.
* The variable t will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
* The index will be 1 plus the sum of all n values, which represents the total number of elements processed during the loop.
* The results list will contain t elements, which are the results of applying the func_1 function to all values of the array during each iteration.
* The stdin (standard input) will remain empty, as it was not affected by the loop.
