Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input and calculates the minimum total cost to make it sorted. It does this by iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of '1's encountered so far (`n`). Whenever it encounters a '0' and `n` is not 0, it increments the answer by `n + 1`. This is because a cyclic shift of the substring ending at the current '0' is needed to move the '1's to the correct position.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the need for cyclic shifts to move '1's to the correct position and calculates the minimum total cost to do so. The use of `n` to keep track of the number of '1's encountered so far is also correct, as it allows the program to calculate the correct cost for each cyclic shift.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
