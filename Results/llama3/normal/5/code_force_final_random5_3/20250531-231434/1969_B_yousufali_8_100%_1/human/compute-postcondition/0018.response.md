Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `n` is equal to the number of '1's in `s`, and `ans` is the sum of all `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` where `n` is not 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state is as follows:

* The binary string `s` remains unchanged.
* The loop counter `i` is equal to the length of the binary string `s`.
* The variable `n` is equal to the total number of '1's in the binary string `s`.
* The variable `ans` is the sum of all `n + 1` values for each '0' in `s` where `n` is not 0. This means that for each '0' in `s` that is not preceded by a '1', `ans` is incremented by the number of '1's seen so far plus 1.
