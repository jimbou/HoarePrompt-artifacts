Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for the number of '1's before each '0' and adds the length of the substring to the answer. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to sort the string.

For example, consider the input "101011". The program will output 5, but the correct answer is 4. The optimal way to sort this string is to choose the substring "101" and perform a cyclic shift, resulting in "011", and then choose the substring "011" and perform another cyclic shift, resulting in "110", which is sorted.

The program does not consider this optimal way of sorting and instead only looks at the number of '1's before each '0', which is not sufficient to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
