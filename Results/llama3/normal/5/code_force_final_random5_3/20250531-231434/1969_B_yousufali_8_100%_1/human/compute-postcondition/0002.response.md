Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains `t` binary strings (strings consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) each on a new line. The length of each binary string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and the sum of lengths of all binary strings does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and a value has been returned.**

The code calls the function `func_1()`, but since the definition of this function is not provided, we can't determine its exact impact on the program. However, we can conclude that a value has been returned, as indicated by the function call. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the same binary strings.
