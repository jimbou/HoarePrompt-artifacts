Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1` takes a binary string as input and calculates the sum of all `n + 1` for each '0' in the string where `n` is not 0, where `n` is the number of '1's in the string. This effectively calculates the minimum cost to make the string sorted by cyclically shifting substrings.

Function `func_2` reads a specified number of binary strings from standard input, processes each string using `func_1`, and returns a value after processing all strings.

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum cost to make a binary string sorted, and the `func_2` function correctly reads and processes multiple binary strings.

Correctness: **True**
