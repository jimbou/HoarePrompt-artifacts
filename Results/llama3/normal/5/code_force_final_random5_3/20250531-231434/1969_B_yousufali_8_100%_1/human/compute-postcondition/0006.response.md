Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` binary strings (strings consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) each on a new line. The length of each binary string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and the sum of lengths of all binary strings does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and a value has been returned.**

The code calls the function `func_1()`, but the definition of this function is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that a value has been returned.
