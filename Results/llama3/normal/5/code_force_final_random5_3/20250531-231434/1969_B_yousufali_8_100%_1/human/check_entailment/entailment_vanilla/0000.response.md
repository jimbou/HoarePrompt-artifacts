Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a binary string `s` as input and initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of consecutive '1's and `ans` to store the total cost. It then iterates through the string. When it encounters a '1', it increments `n`. When it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it means that there is a sequence of '1's before the '0', so it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because the cost of shifting the sequence of '1's to the right of the '0' is equal to the length of the sequence plus one (for the '0' itself).

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The given program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The program iterates through the string only once, making it efficient for large inputs.

Correctness: **True**
