To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The objects involved are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to be greater than the current value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 2, and `t` should be greater than 2.

The other variables, `stdin`, `func_1()`, and the returned value, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` binary strings (strings consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) each on a new line. The length of each binary string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and the sum of lengths of all binary strings does not exceed 2 * 10^5**
