The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of all `n + 1` for each '0' in the binary string `s` where `n` is not 0. Here, `n` is the number of '1's in `s`.

Since the exact binary string `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **sum of all n + 1 for each '0' in the binary string s where n is not 0 (where n is the number of '1's in s)**
