To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need to be explicitly defined). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin contains `t` binary strings (strings consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) each on a new line. The length of each binary string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and the sum of lengths of all binary strings does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
