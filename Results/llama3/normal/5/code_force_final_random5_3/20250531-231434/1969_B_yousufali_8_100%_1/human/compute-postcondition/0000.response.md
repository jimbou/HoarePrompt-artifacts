The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` binary strings. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` binary strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` binary strings (strings consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) each on a new line. The length of each binary string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and the sum of lengths of all binary strings does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
