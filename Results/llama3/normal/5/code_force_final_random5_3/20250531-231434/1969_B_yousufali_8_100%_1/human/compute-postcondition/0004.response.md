Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, stdin contains `t` binary strings (strings consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) each on a new line. The length of each binary string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and the sum of lengths of all binary strings does not exceed 2 * 10^5, a value has been returned and func_1() has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t` binary strings, each on a new line, with lengths between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and the sum of lengths of all binary strings does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, a value has been returned, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.
