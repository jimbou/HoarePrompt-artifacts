Output State: **`_` is `t`, `t` is 0, stdin is empty, and a value has been returned.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, `t` will be 0, the standard input `stdin` will be empty (since all binary strings will have been processed), and a value will have been returned from the function `func_1()`.
