Output State: **`s` is a binary string with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is either `2n + 2` or `2n + 2` if the second character of `s` is '1', otherwise `ans` is either `n + 1` or `2n + 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on the value of `n` and the second character of the binary string `s`. If the second character of `s` is '1', then `n` is increased by 1, and `ans` becomes either `2n + 2` or `2n + 2`. Otherwise, the state of `n` and `ans` remains unchanged, and `ans` is either `n + 1` or `2n + 2`. The values of `s` and `i` remain the same.
