Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input string is "+-+-", the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 0. This is because the program is not correctly calculating the minimum possible penalty.

The issue with the program is that it is not correctly splitting the array into subarrays. The program is splitting the array at every '-' character, but this is not always the optimal way to split the array. For example, in the case of "+-+-", it would be better to split the array into "+-" and "-+" instead of "+", "-", "+", and "-".

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly split the array into subarrays. One way to do this is to use a greedy algorithm that always tries to add the next character to the current subarray if it would not increase the penalty. If adding the next character would increase the penalty, the program should start a new subarray.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty:

```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    penalty = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            penalty += abs(balance)
            balance = 0
    penalty += abs(balance)
    print(penalty)
```

This modified program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by using a greedy algorithm to split the array into subarrays. It always tries to add the next character to the current subarray if it would not increase the penalty, and starts a new subarray if adding the next character would increase the penalty.
