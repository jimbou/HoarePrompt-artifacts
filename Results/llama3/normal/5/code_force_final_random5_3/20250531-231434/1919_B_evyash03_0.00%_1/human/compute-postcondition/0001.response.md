To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `char` and `expression`. The loop will execute if `expression` has at least one character. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `expression` to have at least one character, and `char` should be the first character in the expression.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 1 character, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, `count` is 0, `balance` is 0, `char` is the first character in the expression**
