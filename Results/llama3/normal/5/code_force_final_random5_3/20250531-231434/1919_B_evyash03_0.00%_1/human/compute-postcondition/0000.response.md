Output State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is 0, balance is 0.**

The code initializes two new variables, `count` and `balance`, and assigns them the value 0. The initial state of `expression` and `length` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The final state includes the original information about `expression` and `length`, as well as the new information about `count` and `balance`.
