Output State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression. If the first character in the expression is '-', then count is 1 and balance is 1. Otherwise, count is 0 and balance is either 2 or 0 depending on the first character in the expression, char is the second character in the expression**

In this output state, the value of balance has been increased by 1. If the first character in the expression is '-', then the initial value of balance was 0, so it is now 1. If the first character in the expression is '+', then the initial value of balance was either 1 or -1, so it is now either 2 or 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
