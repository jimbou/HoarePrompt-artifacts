The only variable in the loop head is variable  char and expression, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression.  If the expression has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, expression has at least 1 character, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression. So for the loop to be executed one more time the expression must have at least 2 characters and the length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression and the char is the second character in the expression.
State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression. If the first character in the expression is '-', then count is 1 and balance is 0. Otherwise, count is 0 and balance is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character in the expression, char is the second character in the expression**
