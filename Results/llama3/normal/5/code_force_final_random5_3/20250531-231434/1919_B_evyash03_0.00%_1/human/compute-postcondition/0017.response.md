Output State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is either 1 or 2 depending on the first character in the expression, balance is 0, char is the second character in the expression.**

The code increments the value of `count` by 1, making it either 1 or 2 depending on the first character in the expression. The second line sets the value of `balance` to 0, overriding its previous value. The values of `expression`, `length`, and `char` remain unchanged.
