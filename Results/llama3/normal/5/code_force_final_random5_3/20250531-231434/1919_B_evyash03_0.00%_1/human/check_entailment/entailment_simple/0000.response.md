Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays. The array is represented as a string of '+' and '-' characters, where '+' represents 1 and '-' represents -1.

The program first splits the input string into parts separated by '-'. It then calculates the total length of these parts, which represents the number of '+' characters in the string.

The function `func_1` is then called with the input string and the total length of the parts. This function iterates over the input string, maintaining a balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments a count and resets the balance to 0.

Finally, the function returns the count plus 1 if the balance is greater than 0, otherwise it returns the count. This returned value represents the minimum possible penalty.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum possible penalty, but it does not take into account the length of the parts. The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The function only returns the count of the number of times the balance becomes negative, which is not the correct penalty.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where the input string consists only of '+' characters. In this case, the function `func_1` will return 0, which is incorrect because the penalty should be equal to the length of the string.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
