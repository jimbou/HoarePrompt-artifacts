Output State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, char is the second character in the expression, count is a positive integer equal to its original value plus 1, balance is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `expression` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `length` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `char` is still the second character in the `expression`, which is either '+' or '-'. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, making it a positive integer equal to its original value plus 1. The value of `balance` is reset to 0, regardless of its previous value.
