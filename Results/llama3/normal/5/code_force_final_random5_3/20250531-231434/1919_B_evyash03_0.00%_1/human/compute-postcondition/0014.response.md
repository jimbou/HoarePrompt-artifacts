Output State: **expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression. If the first character in the expression is '-', then count is 1 and balance is -1. Otherwise, count is 0 and balance is either 0 or -2 depending on the first character in the expression, char is the second character in the expression**

In this output state, the value of balance has been decremented by 1. If the first character in the expression is '-', then the initial balance was 0, so the new balance is -1. If the first character is '+', then the initial balance was either 1 or -1, so the new balance is either 0 or -2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
