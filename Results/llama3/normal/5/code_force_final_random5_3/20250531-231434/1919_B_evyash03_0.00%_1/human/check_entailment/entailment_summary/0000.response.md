Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by splitting the input string into parts separated by '-' characters and calculating the sum of the lengths of these parts. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual sum of the subarrays, but rather only their lengths.

The function `func_1` calculates the count of negative balances that occurred during a cumulative sum of the string, plus 1 if the final balance is positive. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem, as it does not consider the lengths of the subarrays.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
