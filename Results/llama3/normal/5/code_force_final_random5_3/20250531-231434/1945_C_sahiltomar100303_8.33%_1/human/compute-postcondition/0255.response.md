Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid must be greater than 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to n. If the character at index left-1 in string s is '0', then left is equal to mid-3, rightZero is greater than its original value, and leftMove, leftZero, and rightOne remain unchanged. If the character at index left-1 in string s is not '0', then left is equal to mid-2 and must be greater than 0, leftOne is one less than its original value, rightOne is one more than its original value, and leftMove, leftZero, and rightZero remain unchanged.***
