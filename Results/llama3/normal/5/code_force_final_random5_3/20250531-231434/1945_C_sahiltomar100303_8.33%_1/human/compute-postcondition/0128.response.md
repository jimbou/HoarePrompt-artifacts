Output State: **n is an integer greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, left is mid, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 1, trightZero is 1, rightOne is 0, trightOne is 0.**

The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` and `trightZero` were initially 1, they become 2. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `left`, `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `leftOne`, `trightOne`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.
