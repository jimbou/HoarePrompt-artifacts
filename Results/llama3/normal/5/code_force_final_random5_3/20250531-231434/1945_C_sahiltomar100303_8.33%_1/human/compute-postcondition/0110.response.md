Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid must be greater than 0, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0, left is 0 or not equal to 0, i is 0**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
