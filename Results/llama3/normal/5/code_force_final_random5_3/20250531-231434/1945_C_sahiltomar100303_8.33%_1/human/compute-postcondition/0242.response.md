Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is greater than 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to n, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1 plus 1, rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, left is equal to mid, leftMove is equal to 0, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index 0 to mid-2.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `leftZero` and `rightZero`. The first line decrements `leftZero` by 1, and the second line increments `rightZero` by 1. Since `s[left - 1]` is '0', decrementing `leftZero` reduces the count of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1` by 1. Incrementing `rightZero` increases the count of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
