Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: left equals 0, leftZero is less than or equal to (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, and rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value, right equals mid.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to (left + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to its original value, and `right` (which equals mid + 1) is less than n. If the character at index right in string s is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value and `rightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one more than its original value and `rightOne` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than (right + 1) // 2 plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than (right + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value, `rightOne` is less than (n - right) // 2, and `right` is less than or equal to n. If `s[right]` is '1', then `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value + 1 and `rightOne` is less than (n - right) // 2 - 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than `(right + 1) // 2` plus 2, `rightZero` is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus the original value of `rightZero` minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus the original value of `rightZero` minus 2, `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value + 1 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise it remains less than or equal to its original value, `rightOne` is less than `(n - right - 1) // 2` - 1 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise it remains less than `(n - right - 1) // 2` - 2, and `right` is less than `n` and is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
