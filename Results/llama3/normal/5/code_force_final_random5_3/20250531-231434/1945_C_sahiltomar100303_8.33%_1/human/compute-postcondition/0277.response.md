Output State: **right** is equal to **n**, **tleftZero** is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of **s** from index 0 to **n-1**, **trightZero** is equal to 0, **trightOne** is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of **s** from index 0 to **n-1**, **tleftOne** is equal to 0.

The loop will continue to execute until **right** is no longer less than **n** or until the conditions **tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2** or **trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2** are no longer true. At this point, **right** will be equal to **n**, and **tleftZero** and **trightOne** will be equal to the total number of '0' and '1' characters in the string **s**, respectively. **trightZero** and **tleftOne** will be equal to 0, as they are decremented in each iteration of the loop.
