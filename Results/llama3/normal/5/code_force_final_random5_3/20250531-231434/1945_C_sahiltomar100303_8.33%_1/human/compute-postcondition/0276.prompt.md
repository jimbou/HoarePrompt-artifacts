Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is equal to 0, `right` is equal to `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` (`mid + 1`) is less than or equal to `n`. If the character at index `mid` in string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. If the character at index `mid` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is less than `n` and is equal to `right + 1`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1` minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1` plus 1 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise it remains equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is less than `n` and is equal to `right + 1`, `mid` is greater than or equal to `right`, and `n` is greater than `right + 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
