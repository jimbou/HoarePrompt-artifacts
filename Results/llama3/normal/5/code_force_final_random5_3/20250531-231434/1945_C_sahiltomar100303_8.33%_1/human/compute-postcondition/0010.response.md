Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 1, leftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 2, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` were incremented by 1, resulting in `leftZero` being 2 and `tleftZero` being 2. The values of `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.
