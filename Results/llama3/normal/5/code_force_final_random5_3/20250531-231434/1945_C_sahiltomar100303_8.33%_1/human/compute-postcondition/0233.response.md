Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid + 1. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 2, and rightOne and trightOne remain unchanged. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 2, and rightZero and trightZero remain unchanged.***
