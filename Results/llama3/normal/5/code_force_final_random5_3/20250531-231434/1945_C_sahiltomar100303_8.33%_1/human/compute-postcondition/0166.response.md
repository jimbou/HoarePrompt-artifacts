Postcondition: ***left is 0, leftZero is less than (mid + 2) // 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, rightOne is less than (n - mid - 1) // 2, right is mid + 1, and n is greater than mid + 1. If s[right] is '0', then leftZero is one more than its original value and rightZero is one less than its original value. If s[right] is not '0', then leftOne is one more than its original value and rightOne is one less than its original value.***
