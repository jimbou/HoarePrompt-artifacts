Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, left is greater than 0, leftMove is 0, i equals n, leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 1, tleftZero, tleftOne, trightZero, and trightOne remain unchanged.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `left`, `leftMove`, `i`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged. The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1, and the value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The conditions on `leftZero` and `rightZero` are still satisfied, as `leftZero` is now less than `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightZero` is still less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus the original value of `rightZero` minus 1.
