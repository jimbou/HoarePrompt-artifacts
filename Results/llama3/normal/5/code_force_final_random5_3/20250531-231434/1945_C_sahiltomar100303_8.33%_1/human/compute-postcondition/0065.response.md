Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than (right + 1) // 2 plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than (right + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value, `rightOne` is less than (n - right) // 2, and `right` is less than or equal to n. If `s[right]` is '1', then `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value + 1 and `rightOne` is less than (n - right) // 2 - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships with `right` have been updated. The value of `rightOne` has been updated to be less than `(n - right) // 2`, and if `s[right]` is '1', then `rightOne` is less than `(n - right) // 2 - 1`. The rest of the variables maintain their original relationships with `right` and other variables.
