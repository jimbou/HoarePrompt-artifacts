Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least `mid+2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` equals `mid+2`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are one more than their original values, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are one more than their original values, and `rightZero` and `trightZero` remain unchanged.***
