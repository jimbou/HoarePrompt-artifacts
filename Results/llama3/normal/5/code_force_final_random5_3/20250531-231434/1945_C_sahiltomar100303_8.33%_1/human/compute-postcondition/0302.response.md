The code prints the value of `left`, which is the left boundary value. The exact value of `left` is not provided, but based on the precondition, we know that `left` is not equal to 0 and the absolute difference between the middle value of `n` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle value of `n` and `right`.

Output: **left (where left is the left boundary value)**
