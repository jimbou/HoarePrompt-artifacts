Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1` minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1` plus 1 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise it remains equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is less than `n` and is equal to `right + 1`, `mid` is greater than or equal to `right`, and `n` is greater than `right + 1**.

The code increments the value of `right` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `right` is now one more than its previous value, but it is still less than `n`. The relationship between `mid` and `right` remains the same, with `mid` being greater than or equal to `right`. The value of `n` is still greater than `right + 1`.
