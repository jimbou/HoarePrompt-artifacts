Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (mid + 2) // 2 and is one more than its original value, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half minus one, rightOne is less than (n - mid - 1) // 2, right is mid + 1, and n is greater than mid + 1.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `leftOne`, `right`, `rightOne`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and the value of `rightZero` is decremented by 1. The relationship between `n` and `mid` remains the same, with `n` being greater than `mid + 1`.
