Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `right` is `mid`, and `n` is greater than `mid`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `rightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right]` is '1', then `leftOne` is increased by 1 and `rightOne` is decreased by 1.***
