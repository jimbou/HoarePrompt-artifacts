Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `mid` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is one less than its original value, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index `left-1` in string `s` is '0', then `left` is equal to `mid-3`, `rightZero` is greater than its original value, and `leftMove`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged. If the character at index `left-1` in string `s` is not '0', then `left` is equal to `mid-2` and must be greater than 0, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, `rightOne` is one more than its original value, and `leftMove`, `leftZero`, and `rightZero` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been decremented by 1. The conditions related to the character at index `left-1` in string `s` are still applicable, but now they are based on the new value of `left`. The other variables remain unchanged.
