Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` must be less than `n-1`. If `s[right]` is '0', `leftZero` is incremented by 1 and `rightZero` is decremented by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', `leftOne` is incremented by 1 and `rightOne` is decremented by 1.***
