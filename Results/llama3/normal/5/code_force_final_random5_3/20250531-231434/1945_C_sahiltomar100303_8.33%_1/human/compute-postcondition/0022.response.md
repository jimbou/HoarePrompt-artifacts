Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least mid+1, s is a string, mid is an integer, i is mid, leftZero is defined based on the character at index i in string s, rightZero is defined based on the character at index i in string s, leftOne is defined based on the character at index i in string s, rightOne is one more than its original value, tleftZero is defined based on the character at index i in string s, trightZero is defined based on the character at index i in string s, tleftOne is defined based on the character at index i in string s, and trightOne is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. The only variables affected by the code are `rightOne` and `trightOne`, which are both incremented by 1. The character at index `i` in string `s` is still not '0'.
