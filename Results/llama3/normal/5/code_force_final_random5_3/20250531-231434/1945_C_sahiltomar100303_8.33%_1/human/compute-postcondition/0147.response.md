Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 1, left is mid - 1 and must be greater than 0, i is n, leftMove is 0. If the character at index left - 1 in s is '0', then leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s minus one and less than (mid - 1 + 1) // 2, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus one, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s and less than (n - (mid - 1) + 1) // 2, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s. Otherwise, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s and less than (mid - 1 + 1) // 2, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus one, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus one, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s plus one and less than (n - (mid - 1) + 1) // 2, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s plus one.***
