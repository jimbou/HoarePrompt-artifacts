Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + right) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the current value of `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `left` which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` is printed.**
