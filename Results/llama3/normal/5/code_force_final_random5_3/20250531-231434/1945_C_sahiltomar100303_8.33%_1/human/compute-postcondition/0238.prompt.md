Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid. If the first mid characters of s are all '0', then leftZero is equal to mid, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is equal to mid, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, left is 0, and right is equal to n. If the first mid characters of s are all '1', then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is equal to mid, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is equal to mid, trightOne is 0, left is 0 or not 0, right is equal to n or not equal to n. If the first mid characters of s contain both '0' and '1', then leftZero is greater than 0 and less than mid, rightZero is 0, leftOne is greater than 0 and less than mid, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is greater than 0 and less than mid, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is greater than 0 and less than mid, trightOne is 0, left is 0 or not 0, right is equal to n or not equal to n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1. Otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid + 1. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 2, and rightOne and trightOne remain unchanged. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 2, and rightZero and trightZero remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid + 2. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1. Otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
