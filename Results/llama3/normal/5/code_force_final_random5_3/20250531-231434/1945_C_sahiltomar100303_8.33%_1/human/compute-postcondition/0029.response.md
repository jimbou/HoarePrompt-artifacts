Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least mid+2, s is a string, mid is an integer, stdin contains no input, i equals mid+2, leftZero, leftOne, tleftZero, and tleftOne remain unchanged, rightZero is one more than its original value, rightOne remains unchanged, trightZero is one more than its original value, and trightOne remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `stdin`, `i`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` are each incremented by 1, while `rightOne` and `trightOne` remain unchanged.
