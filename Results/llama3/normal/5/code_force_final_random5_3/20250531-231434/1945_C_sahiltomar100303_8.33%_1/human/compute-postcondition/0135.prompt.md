Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `left` is `mid`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is `mid`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than mid, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, left is mid, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s. If the character at index i in s is '0', then rightZero is 1, trightZero is 1, rightOne is 0, trightOne is 0, and i is mid. If the character at index i in s is '1', then rightZero is 0, rightOne is 1, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 1, and i is mid.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than `mid + 1`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `left` is `mid`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '1', then `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than mid + 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, left is mid, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, i is mid + 1. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero is 1 or 2, trightZero is 1 or 2, and rightOne is 0 or 1, trightOne is 0 or 1. If s[i] is not '0', then rightZero is 0 or 1, trightZero is 0 or 1, rightOne is 1, and trightOne is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
