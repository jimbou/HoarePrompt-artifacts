Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid must be greater than 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid-2 and must be greater than 0, leftMove is equal to 0, leftZero is less than (mid-1) // 2, rightOne is less than (n - mid + 3) // 2, leftOne is one less than its original value, rightOne is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `stdin`, `i`, `left`, `leftMove`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from their initial values. The only changes are to `leftOne` and `rightOne`, which are decremented and incremented by 1, respectively.
