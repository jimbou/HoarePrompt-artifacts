Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to (left + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to its original value, and `right` (which equals mid) is less than n. If the character at index right in string s is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value and `rightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one more than its original value and `rightOne` is one less than its original value.***
