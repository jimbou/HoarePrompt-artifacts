Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, left is 0 or not equal to 0, i is 1. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero is 1, tleftZero is 1, leftOne is 1, tleftOne is 1, and all other variables (rightZero, rightOne, trightZero, trightOne) are 0. If the current value of s[i] is not '0', then leftOne is 2, tleftOne is 2, and all other variables (leftZero, rightZero, rightOne, trightZero, tleftZero, trightOne) are 0.**
