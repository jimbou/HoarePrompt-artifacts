Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than `(right + 1) // 2` plus 2, `rightZero` is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus the original value of `rightZero` minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus the original value of `rightZero` minus 2, `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value + 1 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise it remains less than or equal to its original value, `rightOne` is less than `(n - right) // 2` - 1 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise it remains less than `(n - right) // 2` - 2, and `right` is less than `n`.**
