Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value + 1, rightOne is less than (n - right + 1) // 2 - 1, and right is less than n**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `right` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to its original value plus 1. The value of `rightOne` is decremented by 1, so it is now less than `(n - right + 1) // 2 - 1`.
