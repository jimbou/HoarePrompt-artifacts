The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mid and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `mid` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `mid + 1`, `mid` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `mid + 2`. 
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid + 2.**
