Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid, s[i] is '0', rightZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is incremented by 1.**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `stdin`, `i`, and `s[i]` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are the increments to `rightZero` and `trightZero`, which are both increased by 1.
