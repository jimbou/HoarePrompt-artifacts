To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid` and `n` is greater than `mid`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than mid + 1, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to n // 2, `left` is mid, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`. If the character at index i in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, and `i` is mid + 1. If the character at index i in `s` is '1', then `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 1, and `i` is mid + 1.**
