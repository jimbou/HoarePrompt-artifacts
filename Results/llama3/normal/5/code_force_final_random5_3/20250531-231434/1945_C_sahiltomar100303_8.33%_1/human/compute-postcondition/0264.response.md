Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` (`mid`) is less than `n`. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is incremented by 1.**
