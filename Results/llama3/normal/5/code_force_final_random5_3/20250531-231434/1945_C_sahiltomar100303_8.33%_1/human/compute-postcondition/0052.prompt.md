Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, left is mid, leftMove is 0, i equals n, leftZero, leftOne, tleftZero, and tleftOne remain unchanged. rightZero and trightZero are the sum of the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, and the original value of rightZero and trightZero. rightOne and trightOne are the sum of the number of characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 that are not '0', and the original value of rightOne and trightOne.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 0, `left` equals `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` equals `n`. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` is increased by 1, and `rightOne` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` is the sum of the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` and the original value of `rightZero`, `rightOne` is the sum of the number of characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` that are not '0' and the original value of `rightOne` plus one. In both cases, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, left is greater than 0 and equals left - 1, leftMove is 0, i equals n, tleftZero, tleftOne, trightZero, and trightOne remain unchanged. If s[left - 1] equals '0', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2 and rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 1. If s[left - 1] does not equal '0', then leftZero must be less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero must be less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is one less than its original value, and rightOne is one more than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer greater than 0, n is greater than left plus 2 times rightOne minus 1, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, left is greater than 0 and equals left - 2, leftMove is 0, i equals n, tleftZero, tleftOne, trightZero, and trightOne remain unchanged. If s[left - 1] equals '0', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2 and rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 1. If s[left - 1] does not equal '0', then leftZero must be less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero must be less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is one less than its original value, and rightOne is one more than its original value. leftZero is one less than its original value, and rightZero is one more than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
