Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2 plus 2 if s[right] is '0', otherwise it remains less than (right + 1) // 2 plus 1, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 2 if s[right] is '0', otherwise it remains less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 1, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value + 1 if s[right] is '1', otherwise it remains less than or equal to its original value, rightOne is less than (n - right) // 2 - 1 if s[right] is '1', otherwise it remains less than (n - right) // 2, and right is less than n.**

In this output state, the value of `left` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `leftZero` is increased by 1, and its upper bound is adjusted based on the value of `s[right]`. If `s[right]` is '0', `leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` plus 2; otherwise, it is less than `(right + 1) // 2` plus 1. The value of `rightZero` is decreased by 1, and its upper bound is adjusted based on the value of `s[right]`. If `s[right]` is '0', `rightZero` is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus the original value of `rightZero` minus 2; otherwise, it is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus the original value of `rightZero` minus 1. The value of `leftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is '1', and its upper bound remains unchanged. The value of `rightOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[right]` is '1', and its upper bound remains unchanged. The value of `right` remains less than `n`.
