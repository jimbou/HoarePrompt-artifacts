Output State: **left equals 0, leftZero is less than or equal to (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, and rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable left is equal to 0, leftZero is less than or equal to half of the value of left plus 1, rightZero is less than or equal to the sum of the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 and the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, and rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value.
