Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (mid + 2) // 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half plus 1, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, rightOne is less than (n - mid - 1) // 2 minus 1, and right is mid + 1, and n is greater than mid + 1**

The code increments `leftOne` by 1 and decrements `rightOne` by 1. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `right`, `n`, and `mid` remain unchanged. The new value of `leftOne` is one more than its original value, which was the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half. The new value of `rightOne` is one less than its original value, which was less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`.
