Output State: **left is equal to 0, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index 0 to mid-1, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index 0 to mid-1, leftMove is equal to 0.**

The loop will continue to execute until the condition `left > 0` is no longer true, which means `left` will be equal to 0. At this point, `leftZero` will be equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, and `rightZero` will be equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`. Similarly, `rightOne` will be equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `leftOne` will be equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`. The value of `leftMove` will remain unchanged at 0.
