Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to n. rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable i has reached the end of the string s (i.e., i is equal to n). The variables rightZero and trightZero have been incremented by the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, and the variables rightOne and trightOne have been incremented by the number of '1' characters in the same substring. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
