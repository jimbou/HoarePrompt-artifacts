Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than (mid + 3) // 2, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightOne` is less than (n - mid - 3) // 2, `right` is mid + 3, and `n` is greater than mid + 2. If s[right] is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `rightZero` is decreased by 1. If s[right] is not '0', then `leftOne` is increased by 1 and `rightOne` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been increased by 1, resulting in `right` being equal to `mid + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `s[right]` are still applicable.
