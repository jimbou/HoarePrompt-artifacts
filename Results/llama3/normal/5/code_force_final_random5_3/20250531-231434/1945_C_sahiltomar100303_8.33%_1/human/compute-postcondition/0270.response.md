Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is less than `n` and is equal to `right + 1`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and it is now less than `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
