Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `left` is `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus one, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus one, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` are still dependent on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`.
