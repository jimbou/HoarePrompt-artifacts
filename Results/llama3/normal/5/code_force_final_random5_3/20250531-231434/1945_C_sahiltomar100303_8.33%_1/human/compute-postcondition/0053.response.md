Output State: **left equals 0, leftZero is less than or equal to (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, and rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value, right equals mid.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the variable "right" has been updated to be equal to the value of the variable "mid". The other variables, including "left", "leftZero", "rightZero", "leftOne", and "rightOne", retain their original relationships and constraints as specified in the initial state.
