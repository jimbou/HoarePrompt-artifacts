Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least `mid+1`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` equals `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are defined based on the character at index `i` in string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are one more than their original values. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are one more than their original values.***
