Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2 plus 1 if s[right] is '0', otherwise it remains less than (right + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 1 if s[right] is '0', otherwise it remains less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value + 1, rightOne is less than (n - right) // 2 - 2 if s[right] is '1', otherwise it remains less than (n - right) // 2, and right is less than n.**

The code increments `leftOne` by 1 and decrements `rightOne` by 1. The value of `leftOne` is now less than or equal to its original value plus 1. The value of `rightOne` is now less than `(n - right) // 2` - 2 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise it remains less than `(n - right) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
