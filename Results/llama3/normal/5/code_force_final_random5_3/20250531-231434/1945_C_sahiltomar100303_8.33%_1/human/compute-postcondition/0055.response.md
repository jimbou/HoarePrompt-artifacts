Postcondition: **`left` equals 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to (left + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to its original value, and `right` (which equals mid) must be less than n. The current value of `s[right]` is '0'.**
