Postcondition: **left is 0 or not equal to 0, leftZero is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value. If left is 0, then if right is not equal to n, the value of right is being printed. If right is equal to n, then if rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of left which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right is being printed. If left is not equal to 0, then if right equals n, then if leftZero is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of right which is equal to n is being printed. Otherwise, the value of left is being printed. If right is not equal to n, then if the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right, the value of left is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right is being printed.**
