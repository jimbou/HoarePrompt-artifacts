Postcondition: ***`left` is not 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + right) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightOne` is less than `(n - right) // 2`, and `right` is not equal to `n`. The value of either `left` or `right` is being printed, depending on which one is closer to the middle of the string `s` (at index `(n + 1) // 2`).***
