Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value, and right equals n.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `left` remains 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to half of the total length of the string `s` plus 1, `rightZero` is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus the original value of `rightZero`, `leftOne` is less than or equal to its original value, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to its original value, and `right` equals the length of the string `s`.
