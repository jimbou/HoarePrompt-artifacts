Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than mid + 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, left is mid, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, i is mid + 1. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero is 1 or 2, trightZero is 1 or 2, and rightOne is 0 or 1, trightOne is 0 or 1. If s[i] is not '0', then rightZero is 0 or 1, trightZero is 0 or 1, rightOne is 1, and trightOne is 1.**
