Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to n, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, left is equal to mid, leftMove is equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `mid` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is equal to 0, if `s[left]` is '0', then `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus 1, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `leftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-2`. If `s[left]` is not '0', then `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `mid` must be greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid-2`, `leftMove` is equal to 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value, `rightZero` is one more than its original value, `rightOne` is one more than its original value and must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', then if `s[left]` is '0', `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus 1, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `leftZero` must be less than `mid // 2`, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value and must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`. If `s[left]` is not '0', then `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value and must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `mid` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is one less than its original value, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index `left-1` in string `s` is '0', then `left` is equal to `mid-3`, `rightZero` is greater than its original value, and `leftMove`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged. If the character at index `left-1` in string `s` is not '0', then `left` is equal to `mid-2` and must be greater than 0, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, `rightOne` is one more than its original value, and `leftMove`, `leftZero`, and `rightZero` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
