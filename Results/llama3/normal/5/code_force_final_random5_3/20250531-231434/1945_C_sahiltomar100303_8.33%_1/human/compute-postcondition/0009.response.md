State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 1. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0.**
