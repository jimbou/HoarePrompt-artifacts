Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, stdin contains no input, i is mid-1. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then leftZero is mid, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is mid, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is mid, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is mid, trightOne is 0.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `mid-1`, and the values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` will depend on the characters in the string `s` at indices from `0` to `mid-1`. If all characters are '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` will be equal to `mid`. If all characters are not '0', then `leftOne` and `tleftOne` will be equal to `mid`. The values of `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` will remain unchanged at `0`.
