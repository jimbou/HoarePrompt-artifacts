To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mid`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `mid`, and `mid` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`. Since `i` is equal to `mid`, we can infer that `i` is also less than `n`.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, since the loop will start from the next index. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `mid + 1`.

The state of `mid` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The states of `s`, `stdin`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `mid` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is equal to `mid + 1`, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1**
