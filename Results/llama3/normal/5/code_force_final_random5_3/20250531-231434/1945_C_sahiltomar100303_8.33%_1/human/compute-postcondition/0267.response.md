Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (mid + 1) // 2 and is incremented by 1, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid + 1 to n-1 and is decremented by 1, rightOne is less than (n - mid) // 2, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index 0 to mid-1, leftMove is 0, right must be less than n-1.**

In this output state, the value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and the value of `rightZero` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
