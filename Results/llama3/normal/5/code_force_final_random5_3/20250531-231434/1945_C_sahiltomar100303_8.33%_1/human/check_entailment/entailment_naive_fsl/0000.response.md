Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the position of the road in the village of Letovo. It iterates through the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents and maintains counts of zeros and ones on both sides of the potential road position. It then adjusts the position of the road based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house. It also correctly determines the optimal position of the road by minimizing the absolute difference between the middle of the village and the road position.

I have thoroughly reviewed the code and could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly implements the logic and handles all possible scenarios, making it correct.
