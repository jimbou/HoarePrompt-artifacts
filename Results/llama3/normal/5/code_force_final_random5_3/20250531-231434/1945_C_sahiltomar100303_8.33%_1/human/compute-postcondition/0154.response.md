Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s minus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the left pointer has moved to the beginning of the string, and the counts of '0' and '1' characters in the left and right halves of the string have been adjusted accordingly based on the characters moved from the left half to the right half.
