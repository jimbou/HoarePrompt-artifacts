Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` must be greater than 0, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` equals `n`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. `rightZero` and `trightZero` are the sum of the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, and the original value of `rightZero` and `trightZero`. `rightOne` and `trightOne` are the sum of the number of characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` that are not '0', and the original value of `rightOne` and `trightOne`. The character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'.***
