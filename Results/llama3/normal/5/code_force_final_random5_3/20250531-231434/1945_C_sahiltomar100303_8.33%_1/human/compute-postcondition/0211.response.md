Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than 0, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, left is 0, right is equal to n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 0.**

The code increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1, making them both equal to 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `left` is 0, and the value of `right` is equal to `n`. The value of `i` remains 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is still '0'. The length of string `s` is still `n`, and `mid` is still an integer greater than 0. The values of `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. Stdin still contains 1 input: a string.
