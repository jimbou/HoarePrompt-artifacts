Postcondition: ***right and left are not equal to 0. If right equals n, then if tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of the value of n plus one, the value of right which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left is printed. If right does not equal n, then if the absolute difference between the middle index (n + 1) // 2 and left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle index (n + 1) // 2 and right, the value of left is printed. Otherwise, the value of right is printed.***
