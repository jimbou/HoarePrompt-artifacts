Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid + 1, rightZero is incremented by 2, trightZero is incremented by 2, rightOne is unchanged, trightOne is unchanged**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only increments `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1 each, so their values are increased by 2. The values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` are not affected by the code, so they remain unchanged.
