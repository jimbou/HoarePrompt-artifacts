Postcondition: ***left is not equal to 0, leftZero is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value, and right is not equal to n. The absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is greater than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right***
