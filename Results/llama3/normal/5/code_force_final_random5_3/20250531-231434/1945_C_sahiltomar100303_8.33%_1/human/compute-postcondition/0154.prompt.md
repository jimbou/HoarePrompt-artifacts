Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, left is mid, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, i is n, leftMove is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `left` is `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus one, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus one, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 1, `left` is `mid - 2` and greater than -1, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `mid - 2` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus two and less than (`mid - 2 + 1`) // 2, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus one, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus two, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus one, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` and less than (`n - (`mid - 2`) + 1`) // 2, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus one and less than (`mid - 2 + 1`) // 2, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus two, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus one, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus one, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus two and less than (`n - (`mid - 2`) + 1`) // 2, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` plus one.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 2, `left` is `mid - 3` and greater than -1, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left` in `s` is '0', then the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` is reduced by 1 and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` is one less than its original value and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` is one more than its original value. The character at index `mid - 3` in `s` is either '0' or '1' with the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` adjusted accordingly.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
