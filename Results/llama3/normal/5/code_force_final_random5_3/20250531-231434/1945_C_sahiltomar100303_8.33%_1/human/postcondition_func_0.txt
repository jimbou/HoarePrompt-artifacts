This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) and a string (a) of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It calculates the number of 0s and 1s in the left and right halves of the string and then adjusts the boundaries of these halves based on certain conditions. The function prints the index of the adjusted boundary that is closer to the middle of the string, or the index of the right boundary if the left boundary is at the start of the string and the right boundary is not at the end, or the index of the left boundary if the right boundary is at the end of the string and the number of 0s in the left half is greater than or equal to half of the string length plus one.
