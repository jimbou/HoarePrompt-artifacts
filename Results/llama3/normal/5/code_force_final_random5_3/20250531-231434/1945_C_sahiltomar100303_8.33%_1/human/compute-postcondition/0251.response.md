Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `mid` must be greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid-2`, `leftMove` is equal to 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value, `rightZero` is one more than its original value, `rightOne` is one more than its original value and must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', then if `s[left]` is '0', `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus 1, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `leftZero` must be less than `mid // 2`, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value and must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`. If `s[left]` is not '0', then `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value and must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and constraints on the variables are still valid, with the updated value of `left` being `mid-2`.
