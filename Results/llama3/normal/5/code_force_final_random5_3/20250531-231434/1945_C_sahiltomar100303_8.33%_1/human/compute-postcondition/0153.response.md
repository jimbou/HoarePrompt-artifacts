Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 2, `left` is `mid - 3` and greater than -1, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left` in `s` is '0', then the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` is reduced by 1 and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` is one less than its original value and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` is one more than its original value. The character at index `mid - 3` in `s` is either '0' or '1' with the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` adjusted accordingly.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and its new value is `mid - 3`, which is greater than -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The character at index `left` in string `s` is either '0' or '1', and the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` are adjusted accordingly.
