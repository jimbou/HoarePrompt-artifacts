Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a string (a) of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3*10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: left is 0 or not equal to 0, leftZero is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value. If left is 0, then if right is not equal to n, the value of right is being printed. If right is equal to n, then if rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of left which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right is being printed. If left is not equal to 0, then if right equals n, then if leftZero is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of right which is equal to n is being printed. Otherwise, the value of left is being printed. If right is not equal to n, then if the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right, the value of left is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program prints the value of either `left` or `right`, depending on the conditions met. If `left` is 0, the program prints the current value of `right` if it is not equal to `n`. If `right` is equal to `n`, the program prints the value of `left` (which is 0) if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise it prints the value of `right`. If `left` is not 0, the program prints the value of `right` (which is equal to `n`) if `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise it prints the value of `left`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the program prints the value of either `left` or `right`, depending on which one is closer to the middle of the string `s` (at index `(n + 1) // 2`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program prints the value of either `right` or `left`, depending on the values of `right`, `left`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, and `n`. If `left` is equal to 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the program prints the value of `right`. If `right` is equal to `n`, the program prints the value of `left` if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of `(n + 1)`, otherwise it prints the value of `right`, which is equal to `n`. If `left` is not equal to 0, then if `right` equals `n`, the program prints the value of `right` if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of the value of `n` plus one, otherwise it prints the value of `left`. If `right` does not equal `n`, the program prints the value of `left` if the absolute difference between the middle index `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle index `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, otherwise it prints the value of `right`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
