Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `left` is incremented by 1, `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `left` is incremented by 1, `leftOne` is incremented by 1, and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.***
