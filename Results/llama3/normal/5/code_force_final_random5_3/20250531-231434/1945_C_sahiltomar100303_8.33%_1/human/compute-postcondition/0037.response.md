Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 0, left equals mid, leftMove is 0, i equals n, leftZero is decreased by 1, leftOne remains unchanged, tleftZero and tleftOne remain unchanged, rightZero is increased by 1, rightOne remains unchanged, and trightZero and trightOne remain unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `leftZero` and `rightZero`. The first line decrements `leftZero` by 1, and the second line increments `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is still '0'.
