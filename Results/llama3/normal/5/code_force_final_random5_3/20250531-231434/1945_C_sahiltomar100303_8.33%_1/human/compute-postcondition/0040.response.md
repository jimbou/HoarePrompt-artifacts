Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 0, `left` equals `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` equals `n`. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` is increased by 1, and `rightOne` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` is the sum of the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` and the original value of `rightZero`, `rightOne` is the sum of the number of characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` that are not '0' and the original value of `rightOne` plus one. In both cases, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.**
