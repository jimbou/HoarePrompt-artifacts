Postcondition: **The program prints the value of either `right` or `left`, depending on the value of `right` and `rightOne`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the program prints the value of `right`. If `right` is equal to `n`, the program prints the value of `left` if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of `(n + 1)`, otherwise it prints the value of `right`, which is equal to `n`.**
