Postcondition: ***The program prints the value of either `right` or `left`, depending on the values of `right`, `left`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, and `n`. If `left` is equal to 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the program prints the value of `right`. If `right` is equal to `n`, the program prints the value of `left` if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of `(n + 1)`, otherwise it prints the value of `right`, which is equal to `n`. If `left` is not equal to 0, then if `right` equals `n`, the program prints the value of `right` if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of the value of `n` plus one, otherwise it prints the value of `left`. If `right` does not equal `n`, the program prints the value of `left` if the absolute difference between the middle index `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle index `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, otherwise it prints the value of `right`.***
