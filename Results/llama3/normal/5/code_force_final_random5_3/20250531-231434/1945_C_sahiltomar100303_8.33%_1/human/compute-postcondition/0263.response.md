Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (mid + 1) // 2, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, rightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index 0 to mid-1 plus 1, leftMove is 0, right (mid) is less than n, and the character at index right in string s is not '0'.**

The code increments `leftOne` by 1 and decrements `rightOne` by 1. No other variables are affected. The value of `leftOne` is now equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
