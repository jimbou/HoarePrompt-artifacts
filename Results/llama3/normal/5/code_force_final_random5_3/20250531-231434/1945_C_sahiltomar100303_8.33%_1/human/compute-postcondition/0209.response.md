To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `mid`. The loop will execute if `mid` is greater than 0. Since `mid` is equal to `n // 2`, we need `n` to be at least 2 for `mid` to be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `mid` is an integer greater than 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `left` is 0 or not 0, `right` is equal to `n` or not equal to `n`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is 0**
