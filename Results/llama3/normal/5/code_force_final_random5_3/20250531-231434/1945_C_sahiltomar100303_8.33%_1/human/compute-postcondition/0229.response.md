Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1. Otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.***
