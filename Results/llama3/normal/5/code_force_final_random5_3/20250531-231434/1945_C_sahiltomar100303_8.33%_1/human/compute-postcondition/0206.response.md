Postcondition: **The program prints the value of either `left` or `right`, depending on the conditions met. If `left` is 0, the program prints the current value of `right` if it is not equal to `n`. If `right` is equal to `n`, the program prints the value of `left` (which is 0) if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise it prints the value of `right`. If `left` is not 0, the program prints the value of `right` (which is equal to `n`) if `leftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, otherwise it prints the value of `left`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the program prints the value of either `left` or `right`, depending on which one is closer to the middle of the string `s` (at index `(n + 1) // 2`).**
