Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid must be greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to n, left is equal to mid-1, leftMove is equal to 0, if s[left] is '0', then rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1 plus 1, rightOne must be less than (n - mid + 2) // 2, trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, leftZero must be less than mid // 2, leftOne is one less than its original value, and rightOne is one more than its original value and must be less than (n - mid + 2) // 2.**

In this final state, all variables retain their original values except for `leftOne` and `rightOne`. The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1, and the value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and their original conditions and values are still valid.
