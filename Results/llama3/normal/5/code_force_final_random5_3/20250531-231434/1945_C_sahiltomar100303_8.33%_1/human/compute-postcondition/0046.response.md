Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, left is greater than 0 and equals left - 1, leftMove is 0, i equals n, tleftZero, tleftOne, trightZero, and trightOne remain unchanged. If s[left - 1] equals '0', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2 and rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 1. If s[left - 1] does not equal '0', then leftZero must be less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero must be less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is one less than its original value, and rightOne is one more than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are still valid, but now they are based on the new value of `left`.
