Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer that must be at least mid+2, s is a string, mid is an integer, stdin contains no input, i equals mid+1, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, rightOne, tleftZero, trightZero, tleftOne, and trightOne are defined based on the character at index i in string s. rightZero is one more than its original value, trightZero is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `stdin`, `i`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1, as specified in the code. The values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.
