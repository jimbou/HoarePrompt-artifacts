Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightOne` is less than `(n - n) // 2`, and `right` is `n`, and `n` is greater than `mid`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `rightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right]` is '1', then `leftOne` is increased by 1 and `rightOne` is decreased by 1.

The loop will continue to execute until `right` is no longer less than `n` or the conditions `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` are no longer met. At this point, `right` will be equal to `n`, and the values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` will be updated based on the characters in the string `s` that were processed during the loop. The value of `left` will remain 0, and `n` will still be greater than `mid`.
