Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid + 1, rightZero is incremented by 0, trightZero is incremented by 0, rightOne is incremented by 2, trightOne is incremented by 2**

The code increments `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1 each, twice, resulting in a total increment of 2 for each variable. The values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` are not modified as the code does not reference them.
