Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid must be greater than 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to n, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index mid to n-1, left is equal to mid, leftMove is equal to 0, leftOne is one less than its original value, rightOne is one more than its original value.**

The code first decrements `leftOne` by 1, reducing its original value by 1. Then, it increments `rightOne` by 1, increasing its original value by 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
