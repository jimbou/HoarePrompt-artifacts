Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than `mid + 1`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `left` is `mid`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '1', then `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 1.**
