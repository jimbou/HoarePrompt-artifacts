Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 1. If the first character of s is '0', then leftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 2, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, left is 0, and right is equal to n. Otherwise, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0, and left is 0 or not 0, right is equal to n or not equal to n.**

The code increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. If the first character of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` become 2. Otherwise, `leftZero` and `tleftZero` become 1. No other variables are affected.
