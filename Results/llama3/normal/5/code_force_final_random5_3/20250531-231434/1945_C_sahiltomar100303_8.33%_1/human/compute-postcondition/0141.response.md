Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, left is mid and must be greater than 0, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus 1, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s plus 1, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s plus 1, i is n, leftMove is 0, and the character at index left - 1 in s is not '0'.**

The code modifies the values of `leftOne`, `tleftOne`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne`. The first line decrements `leftOne` by 1, and the second line increments `rightOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
