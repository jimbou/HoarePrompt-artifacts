Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, left is greater than 0, leftMove is 0, i equals n, leftZero must be less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero must be less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, tleftZero, tleftOne, trightZero, and trightOne remain unchanged, leftOne is one less than its original value, rightOne is one more than its original value.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `left`, `leftMove`, `i`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from their initial state. The only changes are to `leftOne` and `rightOne`, which are decremented and incremented by 1, respectively.
