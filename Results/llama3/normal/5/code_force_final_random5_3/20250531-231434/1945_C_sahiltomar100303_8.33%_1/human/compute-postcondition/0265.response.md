Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` (`mid + 1`) is less than or equal to `n`. If the character at index `mid` in string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. If the character at index `mid` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, which means it now points to the next character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships with `right` have been updated accordingly. Specifically, `rightZero` now counts the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid) // 2`. The value of `leftOne` may have been incremented by 1 if the character at index `mid` in string `s` is not '0'.
