Postcondition: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value. If right is not equal to n, the value of right is being printed. If right is equal to n, then if rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of left which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right is being printed.**
