Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, stdin contains no input, i is mid-1. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then leftZero is mid, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is mid, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is mid, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is mid, trightOne is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least `mid+1`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` equals `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are defined based on the character at index `i` in string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are one more than their original values. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are one more than their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least `mid+2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` equals `mid+1`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are defined based on the character at index `i` in string `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are one more than their original values. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are one more than their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least `mid+2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` equals `mid+2`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are one more than their original values, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are one more than their original values, and `rightZero` and `trightZero` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
