Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (mid + 1) // 2 plus 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half minus 1, rightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, right is mid, and n is greater than mid.**

The code increments `leftZero` by 1 and decrements `rightZero` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
