According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mid`. If `mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `mid` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `left` is 0 or not equal to 0, `i` is 0**
