Output State: **`left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is equal to 0, `right` is equal to `mid`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`, and `leftMove` are still the same as in the initial state.
