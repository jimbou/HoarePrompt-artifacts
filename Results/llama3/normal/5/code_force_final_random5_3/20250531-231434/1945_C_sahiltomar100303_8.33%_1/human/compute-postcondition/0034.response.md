Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer, left is mid, leftMove is 0, i equals n, leftZero, leftOne, tleftZero, and tleftOne remain unchanged. rightZero and trightZero are the sum of the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1, and the original value of rightZero and trightZero. rightOne and trightOne are the sum of the number of characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 that are not '0', and the original value of rightOne and trightOne.**

The code assigns the value of `mid` to `left` and sets `leftMove` to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
