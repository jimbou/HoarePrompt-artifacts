Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (mid + 1) // 2, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of s from index mid + 1 to n-1, rightOne is less than (n - mid) // 2, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of s from index 0 to mid-1 plus 1, leftMove is 0, right must be less than n-1, tleftOne is equal to its original value plus 1, trightOne is equal to its original value minus 1.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftMove`, and `right` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1, and the values of `tleftOne` and `trightOne` are updated according to the given operations.
