Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of length n, mid is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is equal to mid + 2, rightZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1, but their initial values are not provided, so we can only state that they have been incremented. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged as the code does not interact with it.
