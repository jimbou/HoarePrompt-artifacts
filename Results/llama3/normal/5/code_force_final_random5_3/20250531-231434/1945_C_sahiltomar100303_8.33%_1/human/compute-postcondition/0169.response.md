Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (mid + 3) // 2 plus 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half minus 1, rightOne is less than (n - mid - 3) // 2, right is mid + 2, and n is greater than mid + 2**

The code increments `leftZero` by 1 and decrements `rightZero` by 1. The initial state of `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 3) // 2`, so after incrementing it by 1, it becomes less than `(mid + 3) // 2 plus 1`. Similarly, the initial state of `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, so after decrementing it by 1, it becomes the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
