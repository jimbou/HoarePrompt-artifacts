Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer that must be greater than 2, i is 2, leftZero is incremented by 1, tleftZero is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code only increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. Since the initial values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` were not specified, we can only conclude that they have been incremented by 1 from their original values.
