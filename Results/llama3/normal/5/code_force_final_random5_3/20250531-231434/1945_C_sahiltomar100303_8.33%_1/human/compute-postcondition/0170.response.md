Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (mid + 3) // 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half plus 1, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, rightOne is less than (n - mid - 3) // 2 minus 1, right is mid + 2, and n is greater than mid + 2**

The code increments `leftOne` by 1 and decrements `rightOne` by 1. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged.
