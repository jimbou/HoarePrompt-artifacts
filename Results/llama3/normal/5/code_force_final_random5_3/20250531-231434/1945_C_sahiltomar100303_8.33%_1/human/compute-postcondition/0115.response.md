Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 1, `left` is 0 or not equal to 0, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If the current value of `s[i]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is 2, `tleftOne` is 2, `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0.**
