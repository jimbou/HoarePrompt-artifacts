Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is greater than left plus 2 times rightOne minus 1, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, left is greater than 0 and equals left - 2, leftMove is 0, i equals n, tleftZero, tleftOne, trightZero, and trightOne remain unchanged. If s[left - 1] equals '0', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2 and rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero minus 1. If s[left - 1] does not equal '0', then leftZero must be less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero must be less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero, leftOne is one less than its original value, and rightOne is one more than its original value. leftZero is one less than its original value, and rightZero is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and the conditions related to `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` remain the same as in the initial state, but with the updated value of `left`. The other variables remain unchanged.
