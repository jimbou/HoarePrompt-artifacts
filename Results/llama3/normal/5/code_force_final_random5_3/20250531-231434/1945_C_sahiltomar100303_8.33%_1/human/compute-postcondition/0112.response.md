State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is greater than 1, `left` is 0 or not equal to 0, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and all other variables (`rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`) are 0. If the current value of `s[i]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, and all other variables (`leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`) are 0.**
