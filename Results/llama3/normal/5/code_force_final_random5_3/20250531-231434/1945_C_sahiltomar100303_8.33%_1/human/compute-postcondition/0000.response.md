The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a string (a) of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3*10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5. The first input integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a string (a) of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3*10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a string (a) of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3*10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.
Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a string (a) of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3*10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.**
