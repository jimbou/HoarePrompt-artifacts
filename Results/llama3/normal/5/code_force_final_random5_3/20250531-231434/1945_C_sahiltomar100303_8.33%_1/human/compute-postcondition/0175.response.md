Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + right) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` minus the number of '1' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters moved from the left half to the right half, `rightOne` is less than `(n - right) // 2`, and `right` is `n`. The current value of `left` is confirmed to be 0.**

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and adds the confirmation that the current value of `left` is indeed 0, as required by the if condition.
