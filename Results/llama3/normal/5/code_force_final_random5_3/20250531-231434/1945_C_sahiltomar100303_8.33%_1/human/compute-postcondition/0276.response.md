Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2`, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is less than or equal to `n`, `mid` is greater than or equal to `right`, and `n` is greater than `right`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `left` variable remains at 0, and the `leftZero` and `rightOne` variables are either less than or equal to their respective thresholds. The `rightZero` variable is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid + 1` to `n-1`, and the `leftOne` variable is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-1`. The `leftMove` variable remains at 0, and the `right` variable is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `mid` is greater than or equal to `right`, and `n` is greater than `right`.
