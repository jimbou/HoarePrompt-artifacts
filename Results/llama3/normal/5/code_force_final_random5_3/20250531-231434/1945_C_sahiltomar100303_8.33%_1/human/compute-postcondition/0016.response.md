Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer that must be greater than 2, stdin contains no input, i is 2. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, leftOne is incremented by 2 and tleftOne is incremented by 1.***
