Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to (left + 1) // 2 and is one more than its original value, rightZero is less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string s from index mid to n-1 plus the original value of rightZero and is one less than its original value, leftOne is less than or equal to its original value, rightOne is greater than or equal to its original value, right (which equals mid) is less than n, and the current value of s[right] is '0'.**

The code increments `leftZero` by 1 and decrements `rightZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` is less than or equal to `(left + 1) // 2`, its new value is still within this constraint. The value of `rightZero` is reduced by 1, but it remains less than or equal to the number of '0' characters in the string `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus the original value of `rightZero`. The values of `left`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `right`, and `s[right]` are not affected by the code.
