Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `mid` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is equal to `n`, if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1` plus 1, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftMove` is equal to 0, and `leftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index 0 to `mid-2`. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', then `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftMove` is equal to 0, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value.**
