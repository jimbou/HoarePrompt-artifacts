Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of cubes `n`, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`. It also reads the values shown on the cubes, stored in the list `a`.
2.  The program correctly identifies the favorite value by accessing the element at index `f-1` in the list `a`, since Python uses zero-based indexing.
3.  It accurately counts the occurrences of the favorite value and the number of values greater than the favorite value in the list `a`.
4.  Based on these counts, the program correctly determines whether the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left. The conditions for printing 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' are correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
