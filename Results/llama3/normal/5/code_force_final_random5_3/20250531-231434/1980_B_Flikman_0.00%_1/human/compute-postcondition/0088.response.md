Output State: **n, f, k are integers, a is a list of integers with at least f elements, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a at index f - 1, stdin is empty, value is the last element in the list a. If value is equal to favorite_value, then same_value_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the list a. Otherwise, same_value_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the list a minus 1. greater_count is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `greater_count` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
