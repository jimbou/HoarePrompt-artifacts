Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    same_value_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value == favorite_value:
            same_value_count += 1
    greater_count = 0
    for value in a:
        if value > favorite_value:
            greater_count += 1
    if greater_count >= k:
        print('YES')
    elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a at index f - 1, same_value_count is the number of occurrences of favorite_value in a, greater_count is the number of occurrences of values in a that are greater than favorite_value, value is the last element in the list, stdin is empty. If the number of occurrences of values in a that are greater than favorite_value is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of same_value_count and greater_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed if the number of occurrences of values in a that are greater than favorite_value is greater than or equal to k - same_value_count.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `same_value_count` is the number of times the `favorite_value` appears in the list, `value` is the last element in the list, `greater_count` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `stdin` is empty. If the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value` is greater than or equal to `k`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n, f, k are integers, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a at index f - 1, same_value_count is the number of times favorite_value appears in the list a, value is the last element in the list a, greater_count is the number of elements in the list a that are greater than favorite_value. If greater_count is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of greater_count and same_value_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
