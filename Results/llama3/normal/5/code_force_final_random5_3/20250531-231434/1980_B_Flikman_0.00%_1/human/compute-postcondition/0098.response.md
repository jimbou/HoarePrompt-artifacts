Postcondition: **`n`, `f`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `same_value_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`, `value` is the third element in the list `a`. If the third element in the list `a` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 3, otherwise it is 2.**
