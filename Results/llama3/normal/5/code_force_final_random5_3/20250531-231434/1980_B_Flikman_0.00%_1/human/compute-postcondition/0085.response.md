Output State: **`n`, `f`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least `f` elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `value` is the third element in the list `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 3. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, and `value` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `same_value_count`, which is incremented by 1. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` becomes 3; otherwise, it becomes 2.
