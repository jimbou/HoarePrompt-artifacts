Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `stdin` is empty, `value` is the second element in the list. If the current value of `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 2. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 1.***
