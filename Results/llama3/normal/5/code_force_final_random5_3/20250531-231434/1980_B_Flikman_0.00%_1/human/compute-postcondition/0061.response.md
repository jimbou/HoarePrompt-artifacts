Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `same_value_count` is the number of times the `favorite_value` appears in the list, `value` is the third element in the list. If the `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 3. Otherwise, `greater_count` is 1 or 2.***
