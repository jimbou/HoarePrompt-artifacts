Postcondition: ***`n`, `f`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least `f` elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `stdin` is empty, `value` is the first element in the list `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0.***
