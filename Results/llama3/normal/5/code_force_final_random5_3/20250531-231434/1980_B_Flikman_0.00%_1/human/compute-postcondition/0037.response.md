Postcondition: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a at index f - 1, same_value_count is the number of occurrences of favorite_value in a, greater_count is the number of occurrences of values in a that are greater than favorite_value, value is the last element in the list, stdin is empty. If the number of occurrences of values in a that are greater than favorite_value is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of same_value_count and greater_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed if the number of occurrences of values in a that are greater than favorite_value is greater than or equal to k - same_value_count.**
