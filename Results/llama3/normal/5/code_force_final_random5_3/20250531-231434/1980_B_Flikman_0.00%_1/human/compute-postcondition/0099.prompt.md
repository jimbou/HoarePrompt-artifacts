Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, f, k are integers, a is a list of integers with at least f elements, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a at index f - 1, stdin is empty, value is the last element in the list a. If value is equal to favorite_value, then same_value_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the list a. Otherwise, same_value_count is equal to the number of times favorite_value appears in the list a minus 1. greater_count is 0.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value > favorite_value:
        greater_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `f`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `same_value_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`. If the first element in the list `a` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 1. Otherwise, `greater_count` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `f`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `same_value_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`. If the second element in the list `a` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 2 if `value` is greater than `favorite_value`. Otherwise, `greater_count` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `f`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `same_value_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`, `value` is the third element in the list `a`. If the third element in the list `a` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 3, otherwise it is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
