#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: t is 0, _ is t, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a at index f - 1, same_value_count is the number of times favorite_value appears in the list a, value is the last element in the list a, greater_count is the number of elements in the list a that are greater than favorite_value, stdin is empty. If the number of elements in a that are greater than favorite_value is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of greater_count and same_value_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers and two parameters, f and k. It then determines the favorite value in the list (the value at index f-1), counts the occurrences of this favorite value, and counts the number of values greater than the favorite value. Based on these counts, it prints 'YES' if there are at least k values greater than the favorite value, 'NO' if the sum of the favorite value count and the greater value count is less than or equal to k, and 'MAYBE' otherwise. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the corresponding result for each case.
