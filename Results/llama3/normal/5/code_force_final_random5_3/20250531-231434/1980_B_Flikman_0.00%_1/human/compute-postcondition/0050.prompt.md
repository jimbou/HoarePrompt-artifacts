Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, _ is 1, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a at index f - 1, same_value_count is 0, value is the last element in the list, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `value` is the first element in the list, `stdin` is empty. If the first element in the list is equal to the favorite value, then `same_value_count` is 1, otherwise `same_value_count` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `value` is the second element in the list, `same_value_count` is either 1 or 2. If the second element in the list is equal to the favorite value, then `same_value_count` is 2, otherwise `same_value_count` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `value` is the third element in the list. If the third element in the list is equal to the favorite value, then `same_value_count` is 3, otherwise `same_value_count` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
