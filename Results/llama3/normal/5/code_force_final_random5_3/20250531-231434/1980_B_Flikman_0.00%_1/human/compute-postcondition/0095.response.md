Postcondition: ***`n`, `f`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `same_value_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`. If the second element in the list `a` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 2 if `value` is greater than `favorite_value`. Otherwise, `greater_count` is 1.***
