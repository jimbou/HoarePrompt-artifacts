You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: t is 0, _ is t, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a at index f - 1, same_value_count is the number of times favorite_value appears in the list a, value is the last element in the list a, greater_count is the number of elements in the list a that are greater than favorite_value, stdin is empty. If the number of elements in a that are greater than favorite_value is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of greater_count and same_value_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is 0, _ is t, n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, favorite_value is an integer equal to the value of a at index f - 1, same_value_count is the number of times favorite_value appears in the list a, value is the last element in the list a, greater_count is the number of elements in the list a that are greater than favorite_value, stdin is empty. If the number of elements in a that are greater than favorite_value is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of greater_count and same_value_count is less than or equal to k, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
