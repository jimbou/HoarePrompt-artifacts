Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f - 1`, `value` is the first element in the list, `stdin` is empty. If the first element in the list is equal to the favorite value, then `same_value_count` is 1, otherwise `same_value_count` remains 0.***
