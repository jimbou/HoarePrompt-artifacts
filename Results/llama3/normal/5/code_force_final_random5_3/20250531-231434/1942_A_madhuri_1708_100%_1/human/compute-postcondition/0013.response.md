Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) has at least 1 line. If `k` is 1, a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed. If `k` is 2 or more, then if `n` is equal to `k`, the value of `k` repeated `k` times is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
