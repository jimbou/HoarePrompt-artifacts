Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `s` represents the next line in stdin. If `n` equals `k`, a list of `k` elements, where each element is equal to `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed.***
