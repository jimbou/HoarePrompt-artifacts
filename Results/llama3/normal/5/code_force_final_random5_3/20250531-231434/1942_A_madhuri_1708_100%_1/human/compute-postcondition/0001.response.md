Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) has at least 1 line.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the second line of the file object open(0), which is assigned to the variable `s`. The `map(int, s.split())` function splits the line into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The range of `n` and `k` is determined by the initial state, which specifies that `n` and `k` are between 1 and 10^3, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, and the file object open(0) has at least 1 line.
