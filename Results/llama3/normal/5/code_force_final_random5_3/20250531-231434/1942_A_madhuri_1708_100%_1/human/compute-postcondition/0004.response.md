The code prints a list of `k` elements, where each element is equal to `k`. Since the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, the list will contain `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The `*` operator is used to unpack the list, so the elements will be printed separated by spaces.

Output: **n n n ... n (where n is the current value of n, repeated n times)**
