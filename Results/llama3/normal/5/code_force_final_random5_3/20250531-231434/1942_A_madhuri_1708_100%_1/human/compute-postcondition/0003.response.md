Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) has at least 1 line, and the current value of `k` is 2 or more. Additionally, the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.**
