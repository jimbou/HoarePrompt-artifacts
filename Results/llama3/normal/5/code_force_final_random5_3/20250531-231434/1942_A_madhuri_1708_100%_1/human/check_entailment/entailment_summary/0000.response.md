Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program correctly handles the cases where k is 1 and k is greater than or equal to 2.

When k is 1, the program prints the numbers from 1 to n, which is a valid solution because the array [1, 2, ..., n] has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

When k is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints k repeated k times, which is a valid solution because the array [k, k, ..., k] has exactly k sorted cyclic shifts (all of them). If n is not equal to k, it prints -1, which is correct because there is no array that satisfies the conditions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
