The only object in the loop head is the file object open(0), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object open(0). If the file object open(0) has at least 1 line, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the file object open(0) has at least 1 line. So for the loop to be executed one more time the file object open(0) must have at least 1 line.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) has at least 1 line.**
