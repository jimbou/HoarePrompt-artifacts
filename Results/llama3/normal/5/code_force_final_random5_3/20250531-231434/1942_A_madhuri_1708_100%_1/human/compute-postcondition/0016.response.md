The code prints the values of `k` repeated `k` times.
Since `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, the value of `k` can be any integer in this range.
However, the exact value of `k` is not provided, so we can't determine the exact output.
But we can describe the output as the value of `k` repeated `k` times.
Output: **[k, k, k, ..., k] (where k is the value of k, repeated k times)**
