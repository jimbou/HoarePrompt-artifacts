Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k. For each test case, if k is 1, it prints the numbers from 1 to n. If k is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints k repeated k times. If n is not equal to k, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function exhausts the file object and outputs the results of all iterations, leaving the output state as the initial state with the added output.**
