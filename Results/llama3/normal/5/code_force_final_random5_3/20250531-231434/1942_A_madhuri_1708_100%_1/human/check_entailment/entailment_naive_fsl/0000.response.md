Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = 1 and n > 1. In this case, the program prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, but this sequence does not satisfy the condition that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints "1 2 3", but this sequence has two sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3, 1]. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.

The correct solution should print a sequence that has exactly one sorted cyclic shift when k = 1. One possible solution is to print a sequence with a large number followed by a small number, such as "69420 69 420" in the example output.
