The code prints the value of `k` repeated `k` times, where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. Since `n` is equal to `k`, the value of `k` is also between 2 and `n`. Therefore, the value of `k` is between 2 and itself.
Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) has at least 1 line, and the current value of `k` is 2 or more. Additionally, the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, and the value of `k` repeated `k` times is being printed**
