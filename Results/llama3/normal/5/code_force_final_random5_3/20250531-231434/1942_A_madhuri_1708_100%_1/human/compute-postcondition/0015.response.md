Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) has at least 1 line.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values read from the input string `s`. The input string `s` is not included in the output state because it is not a variable that is explicitly defined in the initial state. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, because one line has been read and processed. The file object open(0) still has at least 1 line because the input string `s` has been read from it.
