Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object `open(0)` has at least 1 line, `s` represents the next line in stdin.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the next two integers in the input, and the stdin now contains one less line. The file object `open(0)` still has at least 1 line, and `s` represents the next line in stdin.
