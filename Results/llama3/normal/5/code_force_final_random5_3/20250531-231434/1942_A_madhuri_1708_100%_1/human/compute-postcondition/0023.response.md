Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) has at least 1 line. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` elements, all of which are equal to `k`, is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is being printed.***
