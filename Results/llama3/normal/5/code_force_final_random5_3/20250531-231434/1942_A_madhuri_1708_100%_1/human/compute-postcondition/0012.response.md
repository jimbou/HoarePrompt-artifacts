Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object open(0) has at least 1 line. Additionally, `k` is equal to 1, and a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is being printed, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3**
