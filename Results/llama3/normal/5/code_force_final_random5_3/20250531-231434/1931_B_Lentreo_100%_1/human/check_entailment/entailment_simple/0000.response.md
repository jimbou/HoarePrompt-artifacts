Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program returns 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. If the total sum is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the mean amount of water in each container.

3. The program then iterates over the containers and calculates the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in each container and the mean amount. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the amount of water in the current container equal to the mean.

4. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from previous containers to later containers. Therefore, the program returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
