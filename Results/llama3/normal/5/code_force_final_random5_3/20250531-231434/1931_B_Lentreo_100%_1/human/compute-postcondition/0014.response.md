The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 3, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is the mean of the integers in `nums`, `curr` is `nums[0] + nums[1] - 2 * mean`, `i` is 3**
