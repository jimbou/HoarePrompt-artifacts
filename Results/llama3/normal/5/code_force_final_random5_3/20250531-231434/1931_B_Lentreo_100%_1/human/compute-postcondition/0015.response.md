Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 3, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is the mean of the integers in `nums`, `curr` is `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[3] - 3 * mean`, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated to include the effect of the new code. The value of `curr` is now the sum of the first, second, and fourth elements of `nums`, minus three times the mean of the integers in `nums`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
