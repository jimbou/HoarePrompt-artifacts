Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same if the total sum is not divisible by the number of containers.

2. If the total sum is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the containers from left to right, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in each container and the mean amount. If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the containers to the left of the current container to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

4. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from containers to the right of the current container. Therefore, the program returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
