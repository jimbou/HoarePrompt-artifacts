Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 3, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is the mean of the integers in `nums`. If `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[3] - 3 * mean` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
