The code snippet calculates the mean of the integers in the list `nums` and initializes a variable `curr` to 0. The first line assigns the mean value to the variable `mean`. Since `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums` and `n` is the length of `nums`, the mean is calculated as `total // n`. The second line initializes a variable `curr` to 0.

Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of the integers in nums, total is divisible by n, mean is the mean of the integers in nums, curr is 0**
