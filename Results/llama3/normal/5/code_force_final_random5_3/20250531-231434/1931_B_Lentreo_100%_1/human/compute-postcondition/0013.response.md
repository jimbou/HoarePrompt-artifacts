Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is the mean of the integers in `nums`, `curr` is `nums[0] + nums[1] - 2 * mean`, `i` is 2. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns string 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of the variables.***
