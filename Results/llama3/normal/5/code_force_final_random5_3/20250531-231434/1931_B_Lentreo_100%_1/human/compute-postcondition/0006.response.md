Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is the mean of the integers in `nums`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated to `nums[0] - mean`, which is the difference between the first element of the list `nums` and the mean of the integers in `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
