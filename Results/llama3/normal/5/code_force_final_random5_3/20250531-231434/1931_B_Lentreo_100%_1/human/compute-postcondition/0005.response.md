To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the length of `nums`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, which is divisible by `n`, and `mean` is the mean of the integers in `nums`, and `curr` is 0. However, these states do not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is the mean of the integers in `nums`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
