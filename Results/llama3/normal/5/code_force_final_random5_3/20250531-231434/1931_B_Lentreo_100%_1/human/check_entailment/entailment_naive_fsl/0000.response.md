Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, it immediately returns 'NO' because it is impossible to make the amounts equal.

Then, it calculates the mean amount of water each container should have and iterates through the containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current container's amount and the mean. If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container's amount equal to the mean, so it returns 'NO'.

If the program finishes iterating through all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amounts equal by pouring water from one container to another, so it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1 or where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers. Therefore, the program is correct.
