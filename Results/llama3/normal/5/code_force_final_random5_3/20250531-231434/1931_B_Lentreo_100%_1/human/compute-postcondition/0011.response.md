Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is the mean of the integers in `nums`, `curr` is `nums[0] + nums[1] - 2 * mean`, `i` is 2, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated to include the difference between the second element of `nums` and the mean, in addition to the initial difference between the first element of `nums` and the mean. The value of `i` has also been incremented to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
