Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of the integers in nums and is divisible by n.**

The first line assigns the length of the list `nums` to the variable `n`. Since `nums` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` becomes a positive integer representing the number of elements in `nums`.

The second line assigns the sum of all integers in `nums` to the variable `total`. Since the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `total` becomes an integer that is a multiple of `n`.

No other variables are affected by the code. The list `nums` remains unchanged, and its properties as a list of non-negative integers are still valid. The relationship between the sum of the integers in `nums` and the length of `nums` is maintained, as `total` is now a multiple of `n`.
