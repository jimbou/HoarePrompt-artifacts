Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it's divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program returns 'NO'. Then, it calculates the mean amount of water each container should have and iterates over the list of containers. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the mean amount. If this difference is negative at any point, the program returns 'NO', because it's not possible to pour water from a container that has less water than the mean. If the program finishes iterating over the list without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES', indicating that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
