Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of the integers in nums, total is divisible by n, mean is the mean of the integers in nums, curr is the sum of the integers in nums minus n times the mean, i is n, and curr is greater than or equal to 0**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations without returning 'NO'. The variable 'curr' now holds the sum of all integers in the list 'nums' minus 'n' times the mean of the integers in 'nums'. The variable 'i' has reached the value 'n', indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The condition 'curr' is greater than or equal to 0 ensures that the loop did not return 'NO' at any point during its execution.
