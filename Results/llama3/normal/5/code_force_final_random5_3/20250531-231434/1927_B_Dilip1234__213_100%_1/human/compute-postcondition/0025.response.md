To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, `i` should be `n + 1`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The states of `a`, `s`, `char_count`, and `j` are not modified in the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values of `j + ord('a')` if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `s` remains an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[j]` is the current value of `a[i]` plus `n` if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `char_count` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 26**
