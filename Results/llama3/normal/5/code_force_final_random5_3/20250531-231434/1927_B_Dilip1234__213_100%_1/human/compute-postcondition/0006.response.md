State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`, `s` is a string of length 1 containing the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')` if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `s` remains an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[j]` is the current value of `a[i]` plus 1 if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `char_count` remains unchanged, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `j` is a non-negative integer less than 25**
