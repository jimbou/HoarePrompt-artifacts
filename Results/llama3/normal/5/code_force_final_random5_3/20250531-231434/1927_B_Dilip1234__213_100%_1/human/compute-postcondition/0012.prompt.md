Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`, `s` is a string of length 1 containing the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')` if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `s` remains an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[j]` is the current value of `a[i]` plus 1 if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `char_count` remains unchanged, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `j` is a non-negative integer less than 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is a string of length 2 containing the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')`, and `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[j]` is the current value of `a[i]` plus 2. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains unchanged. `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, and `j` is a non-negative integer less than 25.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for all i, 0 <= a[i] < n, i is a non-negative integer less than n, and j is a non-negative integer less than 26. If char_count[j] equals a[i], then s is a string of length 1 containing the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of j + ord('a'), and char_count is a list of 26 integers where char_count[j] is the current value of a[i] plus 3. Otherwise, s remains an empty string and char_count remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
