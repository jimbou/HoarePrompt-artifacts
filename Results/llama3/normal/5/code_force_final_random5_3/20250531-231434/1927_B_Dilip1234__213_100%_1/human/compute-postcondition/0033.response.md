State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is a string of length `n + 1` containing the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values of `j + ord('a')`, `char_count[j]` is the current value of `a[i]` plus `n + 1`, and `i` is `n + 1`. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string, `char_count` remains unchanged, and `i` remains `n + 1`, `j` is 1**
