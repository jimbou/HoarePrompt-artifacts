To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `j` since it is the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than 26. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is a non-negative integer less than 25. To execute the loop again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is a string of length 2 containing the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')`, and `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[j]` is the current value of `a[i]` plus 2. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains unchanged. `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, and `j` is a non-negative integer less than 26**
