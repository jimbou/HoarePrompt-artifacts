Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is a string of length 2 containing the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')`, and `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where `char_count[j]` is the current value of `a[i]` plus 2. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains unchanged. `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, and `j` is a non-negative integer less than 25.***
