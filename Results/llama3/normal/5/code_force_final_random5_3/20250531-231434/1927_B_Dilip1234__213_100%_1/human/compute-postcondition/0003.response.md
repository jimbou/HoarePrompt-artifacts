Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers, `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, `j` is a non-negative integer less than 26, 26 is greater than 0. The current value of `char_count[j]` equals the current value of `a[i]`.***
