The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. If `j` is less than 26, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value less than 26. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for all `i`, `0 <= a[i] < n`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is a string of length `n + 1` containing the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values of `j + ord('a')`, `char_count[j]` is the current value of `a[i]` plus `n + 1`, and `char_count[j]` equals `a[i] + 1`. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains unchanged, `j` is increased by 1**
