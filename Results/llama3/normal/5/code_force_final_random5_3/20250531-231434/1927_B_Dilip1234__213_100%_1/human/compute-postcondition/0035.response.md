Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for all i, 0 <= a[i] < n. If char_count[j] equals a[i], then s is a string of length n + 2 containing the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values of j + ord('a'), char_count[j] is the current value of a[i] plus n + 2, i is n + 2, and j is 1. Otherwise, s remains an empty string, char_count remains unchanged, and i remains n + 1.***
