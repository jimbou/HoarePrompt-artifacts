Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases with the first input (an integer n) removed from each test case, final is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for num in range(int(n)):
    s = 0
    list2 = []
    a = input()
    list1 = []
    b = input()
    list1 = b.split()
    for str in list1:
        list2.append(int(str))
    list2.sort()
    for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
        s = s + int(list2[i])
    final.append(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in the original `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all strings in `list1` that must have an odd number of elements, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `num` is 2, `s` is the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s`, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
