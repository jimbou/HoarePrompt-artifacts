Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `num` is 2, `s` is the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s`, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is appended to the `final` list, so `final` now contains the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
