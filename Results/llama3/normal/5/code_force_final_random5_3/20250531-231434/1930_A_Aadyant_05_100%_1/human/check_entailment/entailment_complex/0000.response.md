Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing a series of moves on a set of 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It sorts the 2n integers, calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum from the list.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which ensures that the smallest integer is always chosen first, resulting in the maximum possible score. The program then calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first, which is the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score.

The program also correctly handles the input and output operations. It reads the input from standard input, processes the data, and prints the results to standard output.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
