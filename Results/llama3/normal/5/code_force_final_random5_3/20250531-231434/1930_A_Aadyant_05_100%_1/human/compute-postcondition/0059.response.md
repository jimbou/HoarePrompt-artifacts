To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `fin` and the list `final`. The loop will execute if `final` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `final` to have at least one element.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `n`, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains at least one element which is the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s`, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case, `fin` is the first element in the list `final`**
