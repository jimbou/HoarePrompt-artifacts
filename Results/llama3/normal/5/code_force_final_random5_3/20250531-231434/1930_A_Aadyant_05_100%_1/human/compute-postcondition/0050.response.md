Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `num` is 2, `s` is the first element of the sorted `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1` that must have at least 1 element, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to be the first element of the sorted list `list2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now equal to the first element of `list2`, which is the smallest integer in the sorted list. The rest of the variables retain their original values, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.
