The code appends the integer value of `str` to `list2`. Since `str` is the second string in `list1`, its integer value is added to `list2`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer values of the first and second strings in `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `str` is the second string in the list, `final` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with the first two inputs (two strings) removed from each test case.**
