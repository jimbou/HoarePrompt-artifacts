Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in the original `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of integers `list2` is sorted in ascending order, while all other variables remain unchanged. The original list `list1` is still empty, and the last string in the original `list1` is still stored in the variable `str`. The input from the standard input `stdin` is still empty, with all inputs removed from each test case.
