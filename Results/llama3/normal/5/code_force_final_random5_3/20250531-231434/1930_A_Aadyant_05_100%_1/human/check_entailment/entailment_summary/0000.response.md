Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `a` (which is actually `2n`) and then reads the `2n` integers themselves.
3. It sorts the integers in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
4. It then calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first (i.e., the minimum of each pair) by iterating over the sorted list with a step size of 2 (`range(0, len(list2), 2)`).
5. It stores these sums in a list `final`.
6. Finally, it prints each sum from the `final` list.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. By sorting the integers and summing every other integer starting from the first, it effectively calculates the maximum final score that can be achieved by optimally performing the `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
