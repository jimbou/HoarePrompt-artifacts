Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `num` is 2, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer converted from the first string in `list1`, the integer converted from the second string in `list1`, the integer converted from the third string in `list1`, and the integer converted from the third string in `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `str` is the third string in the list, `final` contains the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is equal to the length of `list2` which is now 4, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `num` is still 2, `s` is still 0, `list2` now contains four elements: the integer converted from the first string in `list1`, the integer converted from the second string in `list1`, the integer converted from the third string in `list1`, and the integer converted from the third string in `list1` (which is appended to the list), `a` is still a string equal to the first input, `list1` is still a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `str` is still the third string in the list, `final` still contains the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, and `i` is now equal to the length of `list2` which is 4. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.
