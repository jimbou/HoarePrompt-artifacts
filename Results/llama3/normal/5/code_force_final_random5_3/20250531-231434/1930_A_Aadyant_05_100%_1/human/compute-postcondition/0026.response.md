Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, the integer value of the second string in `list1`, the integer value of the third string in `list1`, and the integer value of the third string in `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `str` is the third string in the list, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element (which is the integer value of the first string in `list1`), `i` is equal to the length of `list2` (which is 4), stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 1, `num` is still 1, `s` is still 0, `a` is still equal to the first input, `list1` still contains at least 3 strings, and `str` is still the third string in the list. The list `list2` now contains an additional element, which is the integer value of the third string in `list1`, and `i` is updated to be equal to the new length of `list2`, which is 4. The list `final` remains unchanged.
