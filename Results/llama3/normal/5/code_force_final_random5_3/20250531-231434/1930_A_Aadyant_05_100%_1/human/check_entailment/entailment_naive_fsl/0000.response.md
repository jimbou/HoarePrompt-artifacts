Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the n moves. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order and then iterates over the list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of the two integers to the score. This approach ensures that the maximum possible score is achieved.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases, the number of integers in each test case, and the integers themselves, and printing the maximum final score for each test case.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when there is only one integer left on the whiteboard, and when all integers are the same.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
