Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is 0, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all strings in `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
    s = s + int(list2[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is equal to the first element of `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all strings in `list1` that must have at least 1 element, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all strings in `list1` that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is equal to the sum of the first, third and fifth elements of `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all strings in `list1` that must have at least 5 elements, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
