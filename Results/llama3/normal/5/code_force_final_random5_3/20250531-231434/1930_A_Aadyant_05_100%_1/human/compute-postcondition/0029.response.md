Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is 0, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all strings in `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.**

The code sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `list2` now contains the same elements as before, but in a sorted order. The rest of the variables retain their original values.
