Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in the original `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains greater than 0, `num` remains 0, `s` is the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` still contains the sorted integer values of all strings in the original `list1`, `a` is still a string, `list1` is still an empty list, `str` is still the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is still an empty list, and stdin still contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case. The loop variable `i` is equal to the length of `list2` after the loop finishes executing.
