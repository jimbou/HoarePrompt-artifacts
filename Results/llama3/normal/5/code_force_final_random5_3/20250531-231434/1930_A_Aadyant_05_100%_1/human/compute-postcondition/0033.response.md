Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all strings in `list1` that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be the sum of the first and third elements of `list2`, since `i` is 2 and `s` was initially equal to the first element of `list2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
