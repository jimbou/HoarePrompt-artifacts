Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer values of the first four strings in `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `str` is the third string in the list, `final` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with the first three inputs (three strings) removed from each test case.**

In this output state, the value of `list2` has been updated to include the integer value of the third string in `list1`, which is stored in the variable `str`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with the first three inputs (three strings) removed from each test case.
