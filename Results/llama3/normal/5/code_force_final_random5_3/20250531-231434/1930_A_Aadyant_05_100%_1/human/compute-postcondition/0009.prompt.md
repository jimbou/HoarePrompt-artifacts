Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases with the first two inputs (two strings) removed from each test case, final is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, num is 0, s is 0, list2 is an empty list, a is a string, list1 is a list of strings
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer value of the first string in `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `str` is the first string in the list, `final` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with the first two inputs (two strings) removed from each test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer values of the first and second strings in `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `str` is the second string in the list, `final` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with the first two inputs (two strings) removed from each test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer values of the first four strings in `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `str` is the third string in the list, `final` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with the first three inputs (three strings) removed from each test case.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
