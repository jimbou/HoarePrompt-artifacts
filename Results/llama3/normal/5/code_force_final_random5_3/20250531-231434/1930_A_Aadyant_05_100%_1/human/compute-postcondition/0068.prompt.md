Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `n`, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s`, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.
Code of the loop:
for fin in final:
    print(fin)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `n`, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains at least one element which is the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s`, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case, `fin` is the first element in the list `final`, and the first element in the list `final` which is the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `n`, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains at least two elements which are the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s`, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case, `fin` is the second element in the list `final`, and the second element of the list `final` which is `fin` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `n`, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains at least three elements which are the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s`, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case, `fin` is the third element in the list `final`, and the third element in the list `final` which is `fin` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
