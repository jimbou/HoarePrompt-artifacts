According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases with the first input (an integer n) removed from each test case, and final is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the variable `n` must be greater than 0 and num is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with the first input (an integer n) removed from each test case, final is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, num is 0**
