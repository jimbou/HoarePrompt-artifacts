#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) and then 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `n`, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s`, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `n`, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case, and all elements in the list `final` which are the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element and the value of `s` have been printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It sorts the 2n integers, calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum from the list. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to process and output the sums of every other integer from each test case.
