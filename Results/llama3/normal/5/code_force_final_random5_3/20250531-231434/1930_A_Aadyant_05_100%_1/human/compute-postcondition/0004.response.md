Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer value of the first string in `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `str` is the first string in the list, `final` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with the first two inputs (two strings) removed from each test case.**

In this output state, the code has appended the integer value of the first string in `list1` to `list2`. The values of `n`, `num`, `s`, `a`, `list1`, `str`, and `final` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with the first two inputs (two strings) removed from each test case.
