According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `list2`. If `list2` has at least 1 element the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of the sorted `list2`. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `num` is 2, `s` is 0, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer converted from each string in the original `list1` that must have at least 1 element, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` contains the sum of every other element of the sorted `list2` starting from the first element, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.**
