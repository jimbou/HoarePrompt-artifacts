Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `s` is equal to the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, `list2` contains the sorted integer values of all strings in the original `list1`, `a` is a string, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last string in the original `list1`, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `final` has been updated by appending the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element, which is stored in `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
