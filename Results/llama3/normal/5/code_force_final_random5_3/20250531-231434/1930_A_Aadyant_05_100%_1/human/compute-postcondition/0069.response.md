Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It sorts the 2n integers, calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum from the list. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to process and output the sums of every other integer from each test case.**
