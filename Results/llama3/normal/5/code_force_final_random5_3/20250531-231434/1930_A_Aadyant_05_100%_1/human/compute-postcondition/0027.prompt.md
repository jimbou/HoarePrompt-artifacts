Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 1, num is 1, s is 0, list2 is an empty list, a is a string equal to the first input, list1 is a list of strings from the second input, str is the last string in list1, final is a list containing the sum of every other element of list2 starting from the first element (which is 0 since list2 is empty), i is equal to the length of list2 (which is 0), stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `str` is the first string in the list, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element (which is the integer value of the first string in `list1`), `i` is equal to the length of `list2` (which is 1), stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1` and the integer value of the second string in `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, `str` is the second string in the list, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element (which is the integer value of the first string in `list1`), `i` is equal to the length of `list2` (which is 2), stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, the integer value of the second string in `list1`, the integer value of the third string in `list1`, and the integer value of the third string in `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, `str` is the third string in the list, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element (which is the integer value of the first string in `list1`), `i` is equal to the length of `list2` (which is 4), stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
