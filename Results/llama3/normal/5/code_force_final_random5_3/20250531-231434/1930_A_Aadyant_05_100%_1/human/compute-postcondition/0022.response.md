Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `num` is 1, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, `a` is a string equal to the first input, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `str` is the first string in the list, `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element of `list2` starting from the first element (which is the integer value of the first string in `list1`), `i` is equal to the length of `list2` (which is 1), stdin contains multiple test cases with all inputs removed from each test case**

In this output state, the value of `list2` has been updated to include the integer value of the first string in `list1`. The value of `i` has also been updated to reflect the new length of `list2`, which is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
