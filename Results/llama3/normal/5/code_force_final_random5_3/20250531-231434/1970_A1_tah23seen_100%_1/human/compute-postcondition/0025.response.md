Functionality: **Reverses a balanced parentheses sequence.**

This function takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")" as input, where the length of `s` does not exceed 500,000. It returns a string `ans` which is a reversed version of the input string `s`, maintaining the balanced parentheses sequence. The function does not modify the input string `s` but rather creates a new string `ans` with the characters in reverse order.
