Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of all characters in `s` in reverse order, `d` is an empty dictionary, `i` is -1, `j` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length `n` remains unchanged, the string `ans` now contains all characters from `s` in reverse order, the dictionary `d` is empty, the index `i` is -1 (indicating that the loop has finished iterating over all indices), and the variable `j` is no longer defined (since it was only used within the loop).
