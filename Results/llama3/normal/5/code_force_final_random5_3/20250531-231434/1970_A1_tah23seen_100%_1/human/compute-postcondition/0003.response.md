Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is 0 and the value is 0 and the key is 1 and the value is 1, `i` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is '('**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `i + 1` (which is 1) and the value is `d[i] + 1` (which is 0 + 1 = 1). The other variables remain unchanged.
