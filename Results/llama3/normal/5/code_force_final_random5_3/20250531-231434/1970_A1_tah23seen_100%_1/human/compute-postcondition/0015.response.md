Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with `n+1` key-value pairs where the key is `i` and the value is the depth of the parentheses sequence at index `i` in string `s`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, the string `ans` is still empty, and the dictionary `d` now contains `n+1` key-value pairs where each key is an index `i` in the string `s` and the corresponding value is the depth of the parentheses sequence at that index. The loop variable `i` has reached the last index of the string `s`, which is `n-1`.
