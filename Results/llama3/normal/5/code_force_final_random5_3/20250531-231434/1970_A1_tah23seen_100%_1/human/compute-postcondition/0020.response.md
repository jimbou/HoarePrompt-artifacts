Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character at index `i` in `s` and the character at index `i` in `s`, `d` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is `i` and the value is the depth of the parentheses sequence at index `i` in string `s`, sorted by depth in ascending order and then by index in descending order and has at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in the dictionary, `j` is the value of the second key-value pair in the dictionary**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains the same, and its length `n` is also unchanged. The string `ans` now consists of the character at index `i` in `s` and the character at index `i` in `s`, which means it has been appended with the character at index `i`. The dictionary `d` remains the same, with the same key-value pairs, and the values of `i` and `j` are also unchanged.
