Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character at index `i` in `s`, `d` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is `i` and the value is the depth of the parentheses sequence at index `i` in string `s`, sorted by depth in ascending order and then by index in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is the depth of the parentheses sequence at index `i` in string `s`, `d` must have at least 1 key-value pair.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains the same, the length of `s` is still `n`, the answer string `ans` now contains the character at the last index `i` of `s`, the dictionary `d` remains the same, the index `i` is still at the last position `n-1`, and the depth `j` at index `i` is still the same.
