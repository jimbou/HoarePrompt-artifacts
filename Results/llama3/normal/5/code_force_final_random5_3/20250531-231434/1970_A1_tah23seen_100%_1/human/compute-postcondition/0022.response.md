Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character at index `i` in `s` and the character at index `i` in `s` and the character at index `i` in `s`, `d` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs where the key is `i` and the value is the depth of the parentheses sequence at index `i` in string `s`, sorted by depth in ascending order and then by index in descending order and has at least 1 key-value pairs, `i` is the next key in the dictionary, `j` is the value of the next key-value pair in the dictionary**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the character at index `i` in `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now has at least 1 key-value pair, as one key-value pair has been processed. The value of `i` is now the next key in the dictionary, and the value of `j` is the value of the next key-value pair in the dictionary.
