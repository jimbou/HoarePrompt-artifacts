Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero). The program takes the number of test cases as input, then for each test case, it takes the length of the array and the array elements as input.

The program defines a function `func_1()` that performs the following operations:

1. It takes the length of the array and the array elements as input.
2. It initializes an empty list `c` to store the modified array elements.
3. It iterates through the array elements. If an element is greater than 10 and it's not the first element, it extracts the digits of the element and checks if the first digit is greater than or equal to the last element in the `c` list. If it is, it appends the digits to the `c` list in order. If not, it appends the original element to the `c` list.
4. If the element is the first element and it's greater than 10, it extracts the digits and appends them to the `c` list in order.
5. If the element is not greater than 10, it simply appends the element to the `c` list.
6. It sorts the `c` list in ascending order and checks if the original `c` list is equal to the sorted list. If it is, it appends 1 to the `b` list, indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it appends 0 to the `b` list.

The main part of the program iterates through the test cases, calls the `func_1()` function for each test case, and prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in the `b` list is 1, indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The `func_1()` function is called before it is defined, which will cause a `NameError`.
2. The `b` list is not initialized before it is used, which will cause an `IndexError`.
3. The program does not handle the case where the input array has only one element.

Correctness: **False**
