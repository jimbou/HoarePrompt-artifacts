Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], i is greater than 0 and less than len(a), and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If y is greater than or equal to c[n - 1], then if y is less than or equal to x, n is either 3 or 4, and c is a list with at least four elements (including the newly appended y and x). Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3, and c is a list with at least three elements.***
