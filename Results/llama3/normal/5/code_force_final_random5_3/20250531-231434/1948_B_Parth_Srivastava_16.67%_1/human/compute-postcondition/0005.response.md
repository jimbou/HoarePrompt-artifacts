Postcondition: **k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], n is 0, c is a list with at least one element, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The first digit of the current value of a[i], y, is greater than or equal to the last element of c. Additionally, the current value of y is less than or equal to the current value of x.**
