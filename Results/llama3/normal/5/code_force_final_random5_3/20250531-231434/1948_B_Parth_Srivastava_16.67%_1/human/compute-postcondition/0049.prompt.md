Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers, x is 0, y is 0, n is 0, c is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer. If a[i] > 10 and i > 0, then x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], n is either 1 or 2, c is a list with at least two elements, i is greater than 0, and if y is less than or equal to x, then y is greater than or equal to the second last element of c and less than or equal to the last element of c, and n is 2. Otherwise, y is greater than or equal to the last element of c, and if y is strictly greater than x, then n is 1. If a[i] is less than or equal to 10 or i is 0, then if the current element in the list a at index i is greater than 10, x is the last digit of the current element in the list a at index i, y is the first digit of the current element in the list a at index i, n is either 1 or 2, c is a list containing either the first element of a or y and x, and stdin contains t-2 test cases. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2 and c contains y and x. Otherwise, n is 1 and c contains the first element of a. If the current element in the list a at index i is less than or equal to 10, or i is not 0, then x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, c is a list containing the first element of a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, i is greater than 0 and less than len(a), and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If a[i] > 10 and i > 0, then x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], and if y is greater than or equal to c[n - 1], then if y is less than or equal to x, n is either 3 or 4, and c is a list with at least four elements (including the newly appended y and x). Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3, and c is a list with at least three elements. If a[i] is less than or equal to 10 or i is 0, then if i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then if y is less than or equal to x, n is either 3 or 4, otherwise n is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, i is greater than 1 and less than len(a), and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If a[i] > 10 and i > 0, then x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], and if y is greater than or equal to c[n - 1], then if y is less than or equal to x, c is a list containing the first digit of a[i] and the last digit of a[i], and n is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n plus 2. If y is greater than or equal to c[n - 1] and y is greater than x, then c is a list containing the current value of a[i], and n is k + 1. If a[i] is less than or equal to 10 or i is 0, then if i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then if the first digit of a[i] is less than or equal to the last digit of a[i], c is a list containing the first digit and the last digit of a[i], and n is k + 2. Otherwise, c is a list containing the value of a[i], and n is k+1. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then c is a list with at least four elements (including the newly appended a[i]), and n is either 3 or 4 if a[i] > 10 and i > 0, or n is either 2 or 3 if a[i] is less than or equal to 10 or i is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
