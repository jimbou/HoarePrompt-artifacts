Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero).

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store the results.
2.  For each test case, the program calls the function `func_1()`, which reads the number of integers `k` and the integers themselves.
3.  The function `func_1()` iterates through the integers. If an integer is greater than 10, it splits the integer into its individual digits and appends them to the list `c`. If the integer is less than or equal to 10, it appends the integer as is to the list `c`.
4.  After processing all integers, the function checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it with its sorted version `d`. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the result list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.
5.  Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the corresponding value in the result list `b` is 1; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input array is already sorted or when the array contains only single-digit numbers.

Correctness: **True**
