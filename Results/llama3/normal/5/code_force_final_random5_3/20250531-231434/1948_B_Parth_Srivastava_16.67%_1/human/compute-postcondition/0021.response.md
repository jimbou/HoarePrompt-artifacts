Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is 0. If the current element in the list a at index i is greater than 10, then x is the last digit of the current element in the list a at index i, y is the first digit of the current element in the list a at index i, n is either 1 or 2, c is a list containing either the first element of a or y and x, and stdin contains t-2 test cases. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2 and c contains y and x. Otherwise, n is 1 and c contains the first element of a. If the current element in the list a at index i is less than or equal to 10, or i is not 0, then x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, c is a list containing the first element of a.***
