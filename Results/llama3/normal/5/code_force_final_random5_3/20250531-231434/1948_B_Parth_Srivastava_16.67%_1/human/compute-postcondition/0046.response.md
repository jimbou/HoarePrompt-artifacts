Output State: **k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, i is greater than 1 and less than len(a), c is a list with at least four elements (including the newly appended a[i]), and n is either 3 or 4 if a[i] > 10 and i > 0, or n is either 2 or 3 if a[i] is less than or equal to 10 or i is 0, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of k remains unchanged as an integer equal to the first test case's value of n. The list a still contains n integers with at least 3 integers. The index i remains greater than 1 and less than the length of list a. The list c now has at least four elements, including the newly appended value of a[i]. The value of n depends on the conditions: if a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, then n is either 3 or 4; otherwise, if a[i] is less than or equal to 10 or i is 0, then n is either 2 or 3. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
