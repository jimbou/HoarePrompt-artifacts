Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], n is either 1 or 2, c is a list with at least two elements, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If y is less than or equal to x, then y is greater than or equal to the second last element of c and less than or equal to the last element of c, and n is 2. Otherwise, y is greater than or equal to the last element of c, and if y is strictly greater than x, then n is 1.***
