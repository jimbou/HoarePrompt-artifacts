Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers, x is 0, y is 0, n is 0, c is an empty list**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to k. Since stdin contains an integer t followed by t test cases, and each test case starts with an integer n, k becomes the value of n for the first test case. The second line reads a string from stdin, which is the list of n integers for the first test case, and assigns it to a. The third line converts the string a into a list of integers using the split() method and assigns it back to a. The fourth and fifth lines initialize x and y to 0, respectively. The sixth line initializes n to 0. The seventh line initializes c as an empty list.
