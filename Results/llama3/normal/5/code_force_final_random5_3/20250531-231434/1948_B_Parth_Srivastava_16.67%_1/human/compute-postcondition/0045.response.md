Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, i is greater than 1 and less than len(a), x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If y is less than or equal to x, then c is a list containing the first digit and the last digit of a[i], and n is k + 2. Otherwise, c is a list containing the value of a[i], and n is k+1.***
