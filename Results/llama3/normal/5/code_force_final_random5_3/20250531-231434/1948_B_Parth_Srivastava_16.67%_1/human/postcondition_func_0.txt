This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It processes each test case by iterating through the integers, splitting any two-digit numbers into their individual digits and appending them to a list, while single-digit numbers are appended as is. The function then checks if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order. If it is, the function appends 1 to a result list; otherwise, it appends 0. The function repeats this process for all test cases and stores the results in the list b.
