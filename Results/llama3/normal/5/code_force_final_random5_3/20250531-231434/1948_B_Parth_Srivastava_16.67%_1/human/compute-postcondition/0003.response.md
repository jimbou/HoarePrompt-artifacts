Output State: **k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], n is 0, c is an empty list, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is the last digit of the current value of `a[i]`, and the value of `y` is the first digit of the current value of `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is greater than 10, so it has at least two digits. The values of `k`, `a`, `n`, `c`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged.
