Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, i is greater than 1 and less than len(a), and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then if the first digit of a[i] is less than or equal to the last digit of a[i], c is a list containing the first digit and the last digit of a[i], and n is k + 2. Otherwise, c is a list containing the value of a[i], and n is k+1. If i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, then c is a list with at least four elements (including the newly appended a[i]), and n is either 3 or 4 if a[i] > 10 and i > 0, or n is either 2 or 3 if a[i] is less than or equal to 10 or i is 0.***
