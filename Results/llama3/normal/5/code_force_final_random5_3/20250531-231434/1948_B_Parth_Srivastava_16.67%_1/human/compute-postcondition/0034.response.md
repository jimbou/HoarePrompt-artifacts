Postcondition: **k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, c is a list with at least three elements, i is greater than 0 and less than len(a), n is either 2 or 3, x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], stdin contains t-2 test cases. If i is 0 and a[i] is greater than 10, then if y is less than or equal to x, n is either 3 or 4, otherwise n is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3.**
