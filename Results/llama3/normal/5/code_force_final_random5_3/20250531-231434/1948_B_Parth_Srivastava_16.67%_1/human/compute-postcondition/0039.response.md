Output State: **k is an integer equal to the first test case's value of n, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, i is greater than 1 and less than len(a), x is the last digit of the current value of a[i], y is the first digit of the current value of a[i], c is a list containing the current value of a[i], n is k + 1, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of k remains unchanged as an integer equal to the first test case's value of n. The list a still contains n integers, with at least 3 integers. The index i remains greater than 1 and less than the length of list a. The values of x and y, which are the last and first digits of the current value of a[i], respectively, also remain unchanged. A new list c is created, containing the current value of a[i]. The value of n is incremented by 1, making it equal to k + 1. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
