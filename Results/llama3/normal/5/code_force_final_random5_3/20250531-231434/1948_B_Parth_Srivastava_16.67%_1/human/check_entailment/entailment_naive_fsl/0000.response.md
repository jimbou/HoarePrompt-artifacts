Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input array has less than 2 elements. In this case, the program will not work correctly because it tries to access the second element of the array (a[i-1]) without checking if it exists. 

For example, if the input is:

1
1

The program will throw an error because it tries to access a[-1] which does not exist.

Also, the program does not handle the case when the input array has non-integer values. The problem description states that the input array consists of integers, but the program does not check for this. If the input array contains non-integer values, the program will throw an error when it tries to perform integer operations on them.

For example, if the input is:

1
a

The program will throw an error because it tries to perform integer operations on a string.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
