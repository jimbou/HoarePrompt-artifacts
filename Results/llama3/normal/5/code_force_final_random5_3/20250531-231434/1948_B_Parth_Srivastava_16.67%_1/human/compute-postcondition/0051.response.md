Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer equal to the first test case's value of `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `n` integers, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `d` is a sorted list containing the elements of `c`, `c` is a list containing the first digit and the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, or the current value of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first test case's value of `n` plus 2 if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, or `k` plus 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases. The current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `d`.***
