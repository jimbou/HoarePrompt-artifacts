The only objects in the loop head are variables  i, char, and string password, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password.  If the password has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, last_digit_index is -1. So for the loop to be executed  the password must have at least 1 character and the index is 0 and char is the first character in the password.
State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, letters is a list containing all the letters in the password, last_digit_index is -1, i is 0, char is the first character in the password**
