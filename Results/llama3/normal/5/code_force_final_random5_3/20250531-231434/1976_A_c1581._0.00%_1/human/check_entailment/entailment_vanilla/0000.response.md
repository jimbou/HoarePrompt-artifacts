Reasoning:

The given program is designed to check if a password is strong based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (t) and the password for each test case.

2. It defines a function `func_1(password)` that takes a password as input and checks if it is strong.

3. Inside the function, it separates the password into digits and letters.

4. It then checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. If such a case is found, it immediately returns 'NO'.

5. Next, it checks if the digits and letters in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either of them is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

6. If the password passes all the checks, it returns 'YES'.

7. The program then appends the result of each test case to the `results` list and finally prints the results.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. It checks for the presence of digits after letters, and it also checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Correctness: **True**
