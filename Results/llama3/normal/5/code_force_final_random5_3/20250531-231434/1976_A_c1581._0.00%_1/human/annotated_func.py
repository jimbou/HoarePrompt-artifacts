    #State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, letters is a list containing all the letters in the password, last_digit_index is either -1 or the index of the last digit in the password, and the digits in the password are in ascending order.

    #State: *password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, letters is a list containing all the letters in the password, last_digit_index is either -1 or the index of the last digit in the password, the digits in the password are in ascending order, and the letters in the password are in ascending order
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given password meets certain conditions and returns 'YES' if it does, or 'NO' otherwise. The password is considered valid if all its digits are in ascending order, all its letters are in ascending order, and there are no digits after the first letter. The function takes a string password as input and returns a string indicating whether the password is valid or not.
