The only object in the loop head is variable char and password, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password. If the password has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, password has at least 1 character, char is the first character in the password. So for the loop to be executed one more time the password must have at least 2 characters and the char is the second character in the password.
State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, and char is the second character in the password. If char is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first and second characters of the password and letters is a list containing the first character of the password. Otherwise, digits is a list containing the first character of the password and letters is a list containing the first and second characters of the password.**
