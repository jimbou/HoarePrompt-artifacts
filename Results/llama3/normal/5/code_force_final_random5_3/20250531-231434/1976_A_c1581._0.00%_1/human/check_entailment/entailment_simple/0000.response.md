Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to verify if a given password is strong based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program first separates the digits and letters in the password, then checks if the digits are in ascending order and if the letters are in ascending order. It also checks if there are any digits after a letter in the password.

The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. It correctly checks if the digits are in ascending order, if the letters are in ascending order, and if there are any digits after a letter in the password. If any of these conditions are not met, the program returns 'NO'. If all conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
