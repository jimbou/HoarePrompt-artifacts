Reasoning: 
The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly checks if a given password meets the conditions specified in the problem description, which are:

1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends).
3. All digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.

The program correctly implements these conditions by:

1. Separating the password into digits and letters.
2. Checking if there are any digits after the first letter.
3. Checking if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program returns 'YES' if the password meets all the conditions and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
