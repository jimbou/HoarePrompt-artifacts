Output State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password, letters is a list containing all the letters in the password, last_digit_index is 1, i is 1, char is the second character in the password.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `last_digit_index`. Since `i` is 1, `last_digit_index` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
