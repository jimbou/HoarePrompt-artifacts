Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly checks if a given password meets the conditions specified in the problem description. The program first separates the digits and letters in the password, then checks if there are any digits after the first letter, and finally checks if the digits and letters are in ascending order. If all conditions are met, the program returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'. The program handles all possible cases and does not contain any logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
