The only object in the loop head is variable  char and password, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password.  If the password has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, password has at least 2 characters, char is the second character in the password. So for the loop to be executed one more time the password must have at least 3 characters and the char is the third character in the password.
State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, and char is the third character in the password. If char is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first, second and third characters of the password and letters is a list containing the first character of the password. If char is not a digit, then letters is a list containing the first, second and third characters of the password if char is a digit, otherwise letters is a list containing the first, second and third characters of the password, and digits is a list containing the first character of the password if char is a digit, otherwise digits is a list containing the first character of the password.**
