Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`, and `char` is the first character in the password, and `char` is not a digit**

In this output state, the code has appended the first character of the password to the `letters` list. The `password` remains unchanged, and the `digits` list is still empty. The `char` variable still holds the first character of the password, which is not a digit.
