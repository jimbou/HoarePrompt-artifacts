Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 10^4) with at least 1 digit, `i` is len(num) - 1, `counter` is 0. The last digit of `num` is not 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `i`, and `counter` remain unchanged because the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The condition that the last digit of `num` is not 0 is still valid.
