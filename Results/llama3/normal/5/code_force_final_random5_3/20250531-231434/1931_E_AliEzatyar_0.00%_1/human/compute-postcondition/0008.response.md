Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least 1 digit, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `counter` is either 1 or 2**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains unchanged as it is an integer with at least 1 digit. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is `len(num) - 2`. However, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1 or 2.
