Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least 1 digit, `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `counter` is either 1 or 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` was either 1 or 2, and now it is either 2 or 3. If `num[i]` is not '0', then `counter` was either 0 or 1, and now it is either 1 or 2. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. Additionally, if we were previously out of the most internal loop or if statement, we are still out of it.
