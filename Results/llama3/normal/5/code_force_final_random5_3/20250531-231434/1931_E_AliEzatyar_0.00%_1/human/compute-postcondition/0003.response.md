Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 10^4) with at least 1 digit, `i` is len(num) - 1, `counter` is 1, and the current value of `num[i]` is '0'.**

The code increments the value of `counter` by 1. The initial value of `counter` was 0, so after the increment, its value becomes 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The value of `num[i]` is still '0', as it was before the code execution.
