Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 10^4), `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `num` remains unchanged, and `counter` will be equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`. For example, if `num` is 123400, `counter` will be 3. If `num` is 123456, `counter` will be 0.
