Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least 1 digit, `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `counter` is either 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the break statement only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and does not change the values of any variables.
