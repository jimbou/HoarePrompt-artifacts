To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means that `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

The current state is:

* `num` is an integer with at least 1 digit
* `i` is `len(num) - 1`
* `counter` is either 0 or 1, depending on the last digit of `num`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the values of `i` and `num`.

Since `i` is `len(num) - 1` and the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `len(num) - 2`.

The value of `num` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The value of `counter` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is an integer with at least 1 digit, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `counter` is either 0 or 1**
