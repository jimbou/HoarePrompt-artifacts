Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 10^4), `counter` is 0**

The code initializes a new variable `counter` and assigns it the value 0. The value of `num` remains unchanged, so it is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The introduction of `counter` does not affect the value of `num`, so both variables coexist in the output state.
