The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and num, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`. If num has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, num is an integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 10^4) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `num` is a number with at least 1 digit and i is now len(num) - 1.
State: **`num` is an integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 10^4) with at least 1 digit, `i` is len(num) - 1, `counter` is 0**
