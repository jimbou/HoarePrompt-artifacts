Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine who will win the game based on the given problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the input array.
2. It correctly identifies the trailing zeros in each number and stores them in the `zeros` list.
3. The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order, which is correct because Anna will try to remove the maximum number of zeros on her turn.
4. The program correctly calculates the total number of zeros that Anna can remove by subtracting the zeros at even indices from the total number of zeros.
5. The program correctly checks if the total number of digits minus the number of zeros Anna can remove is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
