Reasoning: 
The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer. The main program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list, sorts the numbers with trailing zeros in descending order, and then subtracts the number of trailing zeros that Anna can remove in her turns. The program then checks if the remaining number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1` to determine the winner.

Correctness: **True**
