Output State: **`num` is an integer with at least 1 digit, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `counter` is either 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `i`, and `counter` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
