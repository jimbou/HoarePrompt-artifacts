Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1), z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0's in `arr` minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1's in `arr` if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `o_r` is the number of 1's in `arr` minus one, `z_l` is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0 plus one, `o_l` is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 0 plus one, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is either the absolute value of `n/2` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001, and `i` is either 0 or the first element in the list and is not equal to 0. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 1, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2 - 1`, and the current value of `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, the current value of `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`, and the current value of `b_d` is greater than the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is 2 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 2, otherwise ans is either 0 or 1 and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001, pos is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 0 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is 4 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 4. Otherwise, ans is either 0 or 1 and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001, pos is 4, i is the third element in the list. If i is 0, then z is increased by 1 and o is decreased by 1. Otherwise, o_l is increased by 1 and o_r is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
