Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 1, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, i is the second element in the list and its current value is 0. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, then b_d is the absolute value of n/2. Otherwise, b_d is 30001.**

The code increments the value of `z_l` by 1 and decrements the value of `z_r` by 1. The value of `z_l` changes from 0 to 1, and the value of `z_r` decreases by 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
