This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer n and a string of length n containing only 0s and 1s. The function calculates the position where the number of 1s to the right of the position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 1s and 0s to the right, and the number of 0s to the left of the position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 0s and 1s to the left. If such a position is found, the function prints the position; otherwise, it prints 0. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been consumed.
