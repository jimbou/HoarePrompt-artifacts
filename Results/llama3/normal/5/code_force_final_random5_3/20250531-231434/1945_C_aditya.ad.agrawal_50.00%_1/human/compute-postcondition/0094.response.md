Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is 2 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 2, otherwise ans is either 0 or 1 and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001, pos is 4, i is the third element in the list, o_l is increased by 1, o_r is decreased by 1.**

The code increments the value of `o_l` by 1 and decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. No other variables are affected.
