Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1), z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, and pos is 0.**

The code reads an integer `n` and a string `input_string` from stdin, which contains a test case. It then creates a list `arr` of integers (0 or 1) from the string. The variables `z` and `o` are assigned the count of 0's and 1's in `arr`, respectively. The variables `z_r` and `o_r` are initialized to the values of `z` and `o`, respectively. The variables `z_l` and `o_l` are set to 0. The variable `dist` is assigned the absolute value of `n/2`, and the variables `ans` and `pos` are initialized to 0.
