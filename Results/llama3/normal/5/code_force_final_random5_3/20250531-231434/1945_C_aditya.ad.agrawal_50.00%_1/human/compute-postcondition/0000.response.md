Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain two inputs each: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.
