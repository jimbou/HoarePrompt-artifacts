Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1), z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0. o_r is less than (z_r + o_r) / 2***
