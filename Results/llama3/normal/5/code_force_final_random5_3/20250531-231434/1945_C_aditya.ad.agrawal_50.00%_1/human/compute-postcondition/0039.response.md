Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1), `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `b_d` is 30001.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `b_d` is introduced with a value of 30001. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties.
