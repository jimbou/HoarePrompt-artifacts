Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 2, o_l is 0 or 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 - pos, then ans is 1, otherwise ans is 0, pos is 2, i is the third element in the list. If i is 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 2, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1. If i is 0, then o_r is the number of 1's in arr, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus 1.**

The code increments `z_l` by 1 and decrements `z_r` by 1. The initial state had `z_l` as 1, so it becomes 2. The initial state had `z_r` as the number of 0's in `arr`, so it becomes the number of 0's in `arr` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
