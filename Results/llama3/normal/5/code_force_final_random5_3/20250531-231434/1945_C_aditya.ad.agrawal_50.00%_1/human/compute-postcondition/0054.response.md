Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 0 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 0 plus one, o_l is 1, i is the second element in the list, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 1, pos is 2, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 2.**

The code increments `o_l` by 1 and decrements `o_r` by 1. Since `o_l` was 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 0 plus one, `o_l` becomes 1. The value of `o_r` was the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `o_r` is the number of 1's in arr minus one, so `o_r` decreases by 1. The values of `ans`, `pos`, and `b_d` remain unchanged because the conditions for updating them are not met.
