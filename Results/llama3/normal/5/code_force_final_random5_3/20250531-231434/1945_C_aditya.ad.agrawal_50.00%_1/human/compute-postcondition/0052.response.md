Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 0 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 0 plus one, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_l is 0 plus one, dist is the absolute value of n/2, and the current value of i is the second element in the list. If o_r is greater than or equal to (z_r + o_r) / 2, z_l is greater than or equal to (z_l + o_l) / 2, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 - pos, then ans is 1, pos is 2, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 2. Otherwise, the values of ans, pos, and b_d remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of pos has been incremented by 1. The values of ans and b_d remain unchanged, unless the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2, and b_d > |n/2 - pos| are met, in which case ans is 1, pos is 2, and b_d is |n/2 - 2|.
