Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1), z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for the new variable `b_d`, which is assigned the value of `dist`, which is the absolute value of `n/2`. This means that `b_d` is now equal to the absolute value of half of the length of the input string `input_string` or the list `arr`.
