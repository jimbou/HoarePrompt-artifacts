Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1), z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 if o_r is greater than or equal to (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 0 plus one, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_l is 0 plus one, dist is the absolute value of n/2, and the current value of i is the first element in the list. If o_r is greater than or equal to (z_r + o_r) / 2, z_l is greater than or equal to (z_l + o_l) / 2, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 - pos, then ans is 1, pos is 1, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 1. Otherwise, the values of ans, pos, and b_d remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 0 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 0 plus one, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_l is 0 plus one, dist is the absolute value of n/2, and the current value of i is the second element in the list. If o_r is greater than or equal to (z_r + o_r) / 2, z_l is greater than or equal to (z_l + o_l) / 2, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 - pos, then ans is 1, pos is 2, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 2. Otherwise, the values of ans, pos, and b_d remain unchanged. If i is 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 1, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_l is 0 plus one. If i is not 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 0 plus one, o_l is 1, ans is 1, pos is 2, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr. If i is 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 1 plus one, o_l is 1, ans is 1 if the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)) are not met, otherwise ans is 4, pos is 4, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 4. If i is not 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 0 plus one, o_l is 1, ans is 1 if the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)) are not met, otherwise ans is 4, pos is 4, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
