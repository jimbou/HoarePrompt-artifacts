Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr. If i is 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 1 plus one, o_l is 1, ans is 1 if the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)) are not met, otherwise ans is 4, pos is 4, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 4. If i is not 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 0 plus one, o_l is 1, ans is 1 if the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)) are not met, otherwise ans is 4, pos is 4, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 4.***
