Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is either 0 or 1, pos is 2, b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001. If the second element in the list is 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 2 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 1, o_l is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_l is 1. If the second element in the list is 1, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise z_l is 0 plus one, o_l is 1 if the first element in the list is 1, otherwise o_l is 0.***
