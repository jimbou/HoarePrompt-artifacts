Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1), `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `b_d` is 30001.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `b_d` which is assigned the value 30001. All other variables remain unchanged.
