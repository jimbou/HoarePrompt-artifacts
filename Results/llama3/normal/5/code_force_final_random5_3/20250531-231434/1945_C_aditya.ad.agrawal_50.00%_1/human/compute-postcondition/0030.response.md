Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 or 2, o_r is the number of 1's in arr or the number of 1's in arr minus 1, z_l is 1 or 2, o_l is 0 or 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 - pos, then ans is 1 or 2, otherwise ans is 4, pos is 4, i is the fourth element in the list. If the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)) are met, then ans is 4 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 4. Otherwise, ans remains 0 or 1.**
