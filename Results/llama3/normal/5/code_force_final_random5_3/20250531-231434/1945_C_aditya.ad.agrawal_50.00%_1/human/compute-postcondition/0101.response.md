Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0 decreased by 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) that must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is either 0 or the value of `pos` when `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, `b_d` is either the absolute value of `n/2` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001, `pos` is `n`, `i` is the last element in the list. If `i` is 0, then `z` is increased by 1 and `o` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, and the value of `ans` is being printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` has decreased by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The program is still in the same state as before, with the same values for `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`, `ans`, `b_d`, `pos`, and `i`. The only change is that `t` has been decremented by 1.
