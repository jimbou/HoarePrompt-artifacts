Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0's in `arr` minus 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1's in `arr` if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `o_r` is the number of 1's in `arr` minus one, `z_l` is 1 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0 plus one, `o_l` is 0 if the first element in the list is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 0 plus one, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is either the absolute value of `n/2` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001, and `i` is either 0 or the first element in the list and is not equal to 0. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 1, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2 - 1`, and the current value of `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, the current value of `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`, and the current value of `b_d` is greater than the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`.***
