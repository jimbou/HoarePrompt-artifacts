Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1), z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, then b_d is the absolute value of n/2. Otherwise, b_d is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 1, o_l is 0 or 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 - pos, then ans is 1, otherwise ans is 0, pos is 1, i is the second element in the list. If i is 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr. If i is 0, then o_r is the number of 1's in arr, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 1 or 2, o_l is 0 or 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 - pos, then ans is 1, otherwise ans is 0, pos is 2, i is the third element in the list. If i is 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 or 2, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1. If i is 0, then o_r is the number of 1's in arr, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus 1. If the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)) are met, then ans is 2 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 2. Otherwise, ans remains 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1 or 2, o_r is the number of 1's in arr or the number of 1's in arr minus 1, z_l is 1 or 2, o_l is 0 or 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 - pos, then ans is 4. Otherwise, ans remains 0 or 1. pos is 4, i is the fourth element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
