Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is either the absolute value of `n/2` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001, and `i` is the first element in the list. The current value of `i` is 0.***
