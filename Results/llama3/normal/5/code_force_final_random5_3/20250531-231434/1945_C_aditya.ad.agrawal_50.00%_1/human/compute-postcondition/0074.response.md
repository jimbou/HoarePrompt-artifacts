The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, all other variables are adjusted according to the loop body. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001, and i is the first element in the list**
