Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1), `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` are first met, `pos` is `n`, and `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2 - ans`, and the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` are first met which is `ans` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has decreased by 1, and the number of test cases in stdin has also decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the position where the conditions are first met is still being printed.
