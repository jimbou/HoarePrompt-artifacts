Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 4, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - 4, pos is 4, i is the third element in the list. If i is 0, then z is increased by 1 and o is decreased by 1. Otherwise, o_l is increased by 1 and o_r is decreased by 1.**

The code assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`, making `ans` equal to 4. It also calculates the absolute value of `n/2 - pos` and assigns it to `b_d`, making `b_d` equal to the absolute value of `n/2 - 4`. The values of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`, `pos`, and `i` remain unchanged.
