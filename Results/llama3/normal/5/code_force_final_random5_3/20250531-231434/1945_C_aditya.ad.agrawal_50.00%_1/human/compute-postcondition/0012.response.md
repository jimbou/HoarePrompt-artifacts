Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (3 <= `n` <= 3*10^5) and then a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1. `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list and is not equal to 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, then `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.***
