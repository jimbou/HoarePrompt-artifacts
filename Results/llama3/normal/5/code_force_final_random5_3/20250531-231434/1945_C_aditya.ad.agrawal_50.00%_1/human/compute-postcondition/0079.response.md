Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus one, z_l is 0 plus one, o_l is 0 plus one, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001, and i is the first element in the list and is not equal to 0**

In this output state, the values of `o_l` and `o_r` have been updated. `o_l` has been incremented by 1, and `o_r` has been decremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
