Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least n elements, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is either 0 or the value of pos when o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, otherwise b_d is 30001, pos is n, i is the last element in the list. If i is 0, then z is increased by 1 and o is decreased by 1. Otherwise, o_l is increased by 1 and o_r is decreased by 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates over the list `arr` and updates the variables `pos`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `ans`, and `b_d` based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The final state of these variables depends on the values of `arr` and the conditions in the loop body. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
