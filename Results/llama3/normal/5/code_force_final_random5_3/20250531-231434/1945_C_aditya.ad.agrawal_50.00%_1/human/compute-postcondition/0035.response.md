Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1), z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is 0, o_r is 0, z_l is the number of 0's in arr, o_l is the number of 1's in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) are met for the last time, pos is n, and the position where the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) are met for the last time, which is ans is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `t` has been decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case, with each test case having two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1. The values of `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, and `pos` remain the same as before.
