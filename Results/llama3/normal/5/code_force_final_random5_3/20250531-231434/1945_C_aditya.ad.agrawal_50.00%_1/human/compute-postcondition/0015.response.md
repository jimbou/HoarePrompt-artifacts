Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1) that must have at least 1 element, z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is the number of 0's in arr, o_r is the number of 1's in arr, z_l is 1, o_l is 0 or 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 1, i is the second element in the list. If i is 0, then z_r is the number of 0's in arr minus 1, otherwise z_r is the number of 0's in arr. If i is 0, then o_r is the number of 1's in arr, otherwise o_r is the number of 1's in arr minus 1. The current value of o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r. The current value of z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l. The current value of b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 - pos.***
