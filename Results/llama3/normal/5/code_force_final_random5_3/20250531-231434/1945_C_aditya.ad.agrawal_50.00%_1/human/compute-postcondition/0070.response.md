The code block reads three lines from stdin, decreasing the number of test cases by three. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `input_string`, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1. The third line assigns a list of integers (0 or 1) to `arr`, which is a list of `n` integers. The values of `z` and `o` are updated to be the number of 0's and 1's in `arr`, respectively. The values of `z_r` and `o_r` are updated to be the number of 0's and 1's in `arr`, respectively. The values of `z_l` and `o_l` are updated to be 0. The value of `dist` is updated to be the absolute value of `n/2`. The values of `ans` and `pos` are updated to be 0.
