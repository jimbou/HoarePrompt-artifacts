Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1. n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, input_string is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of n integers (0 or 1), z is the number of 0's in arr, o is the number of 1's in arr, z_r is 0, o_r is 0, z_l is the number of 0's in arr, o_l is the number of 1's in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) are met for the last time, pos is n, and the position where the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) are met for the last time, which is ans is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1 decreased by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1), `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` are first met, `pos` is `n`, and `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2 - ans`, and the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` are first met which is `ans` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0 decreased by 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `input_string` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) that must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of 0's in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1's in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is either 0 or the value of `pos` when `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, `b_d` is either the absolute value of `n/2` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001, `pos` is `n`, `i` is the last element in the list. If `i` is 0, then `z` is increased by 1 and `o` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, and the value of `ans` is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
