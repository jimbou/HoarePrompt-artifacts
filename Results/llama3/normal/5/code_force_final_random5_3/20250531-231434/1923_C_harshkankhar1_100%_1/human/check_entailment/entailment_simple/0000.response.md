Reasoning: The program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good or not. The array `b` is used to keep track of the minimum sum required to make all elements in the subarray greater than 1. The array `a` is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of the original array. The program then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to the minimum sum required to make all elements in the subarray greater than 1. If it is, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The program also handles the case where the subarray has only one element correctly by printing 'NO' in that case.

Correctness: **True**
