Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, q is an integer, a is a list of integers of length n+1, b is a list of integers of length n+1 where b[1] is 1 if a[1] > 1 else 2, b[2] is b[1] plus 1 if a[2] > 1 else 2, b[3] is b[2] plus 1 if a[3] > 1 else 2, i is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `q`, `a`, and `b` (except for `b[3]`) remain unchanged. The value of `b[3]` is updated based on the value of `a[3]`. If `a[3]` is greater than 1, `b[3]` becomes `b[2] + 1`, otherwise it becomes `b[2] + 2`. The value of `i` remains 3. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
