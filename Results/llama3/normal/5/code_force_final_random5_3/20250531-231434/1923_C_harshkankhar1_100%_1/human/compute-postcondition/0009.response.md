To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is at least 1. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to assign a specific value to it, but we can indicate that it will take on the values from 0 to `q-1` during the loop iterations.

State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `a[i]` is the sum of all elements in the original list up to index `i`, `b` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `b[i]` is `b[i-1]` plus 1 if the original `a[i]` was greater than 1 else 2 for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `_` will take on values from 0 to `q-1`**
