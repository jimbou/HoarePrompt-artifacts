#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two integers, and then a list of integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The two integers are the length of the array c and the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of integers of length n+1, b is a list of integers of length n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: n is an integer, q is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers of length n+1 where a[i] is the sum of all elements in the original list up to index i, b is a list of integers of length n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if the original a[i] was greater than 1 else 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, _ is q

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer (n) and two integers (length of array c and number of queries), followed by a list of integers (array c). It then calculates a new array b where each element is the sum of 1 (if the corresponding element in array c is greater than 1) or 2, plus the previous element in array b. After that, it reads a number of queries (q) and for each query, it reads a pair of integers (x, y) representing the borders of a subarray. It then checks if the sum of elements in the subarray (from x to y) is less than the sum of corresponding elements in array b, or if x is equal to y. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. This process is repeated for all test cases.
