To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers of length `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `b[1]` is 1 if `a[1]` > 1 else 2, and `b[2]` is `b[1]` plus 1 if `a[2]` > 1 else 2, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
