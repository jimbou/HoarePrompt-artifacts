Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". The program calculates the prefix sum of the array `a` and the prefix sum of the array `b`, where `b[i]` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1 and 2 otherwise. This is done to ensure that the sum of the elements in the subarray `b` is greater than the sum of the elements in the subarray `a`.

The program then iterates over the queries and checks if the sum of the elements in the subarray `a` from index `x` to `y` is less than the sum of the elements in the subarray `b` from index `x` to `y`. If this condition is true, it means that the subarray `a` from index `x` to `y` can be transformed into a subarray `b` that satisfies the conditions, and the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program also correctly handles the edge case where `x` is equal to `y`, in which case the subarray has only one element and cannot be transformed into a subarray `b` that satisfies the conditions.

Overall, the program correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good" and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
