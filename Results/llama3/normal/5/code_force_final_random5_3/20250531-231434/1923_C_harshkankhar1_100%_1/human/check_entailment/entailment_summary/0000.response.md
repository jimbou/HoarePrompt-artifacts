Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". The program calculates the sum of the subarray and the sum of the corresponding elements in array b, and checks if the sum of the subarray is less than the sum of the corresponding elements in array b, or if the subarray has only one element. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. This is in line with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
