Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, q is an integer, a is a list of integers of length n+1, b is a list of integers of length n+1 where b[1] is 1 if a[1] > 1 else 2, and b[2] is b[1] plus 1 if a[2] > 1 else 2, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `q` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `b` is modified at index `i` (which is 2) by adding the value of `x` to `b[i - 1]`. The value of `x` is determined by the condition `a[i] > 1`, which results in `x` being 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, and 2 otherwise. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin is reduced by 1 test case as the code consumes one test case.
