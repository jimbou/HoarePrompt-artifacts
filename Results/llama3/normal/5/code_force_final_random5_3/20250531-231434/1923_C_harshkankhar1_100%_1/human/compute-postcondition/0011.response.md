The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `_` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `q-2`, `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is `q-1` and for the loop to execute again `q` must be greater than `q-1` which is `q` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `a[i]` is the sum of all elements in the original list up to index `i`, `b` is a list of integers of length `n+1` where `b[i]` is `b[i-1]` plus 1 if the original `a[i]` was greater than 1 else 2 for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `_` is `q-1`**
