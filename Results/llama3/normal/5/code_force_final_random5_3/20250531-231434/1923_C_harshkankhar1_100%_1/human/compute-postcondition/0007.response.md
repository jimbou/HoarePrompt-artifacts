Output State: **n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of integers of length n+1, b is a list of integers of length n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The list `b` has been updated such that each element `b[i]` is the sum of the previous element `b[i-1]` and 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, or 2 otherwise, for all `i` from 1 to `n`. The values of `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged.
