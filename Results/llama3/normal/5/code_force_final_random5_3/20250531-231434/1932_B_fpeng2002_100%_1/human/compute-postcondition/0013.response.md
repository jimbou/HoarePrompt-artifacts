Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, x is n-1, and the smallest multiple of nums[n-1] that is greater than or equal to its previous value which is start_year is being printed**

Explanation:

The first line decrements `num_tests` by 1, so its value is now between 0 and 998 inclusive.

The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, so its value is now between 1 and 100 inclusive.

The third line assigns a list of `n` integers to `nums`, where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.

The fourth line assigns 0 to `start_year`, so its value is now 0.

The value of `x` is not modified by the code, so it remains `n-1`.

The smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value, which is `start_year`, is still being printed.

The number of test cases in `stdin` is decremented by 1, so it now contains `t-2` test cases.
