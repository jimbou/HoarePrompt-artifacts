The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 2 integers, x is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the x is 2.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[1]` and is greater than or equal to `nums[1]`, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is 2, `start_year` is updated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value.**
