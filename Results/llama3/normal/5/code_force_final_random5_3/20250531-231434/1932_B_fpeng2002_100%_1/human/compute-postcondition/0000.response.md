The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `num_tests`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). So, `num_tests` is assigned the value of t which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6)**
