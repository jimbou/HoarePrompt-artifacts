The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and the length of the list nums. If x is less than the length of the list nums, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 1, nums has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again x must be increased by 1 and nums must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 3 elements, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[1]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `x` is 2**
