To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `nums` has at least one element. Since `x` is the loop variable, it should start from 0.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `x` is 0**
