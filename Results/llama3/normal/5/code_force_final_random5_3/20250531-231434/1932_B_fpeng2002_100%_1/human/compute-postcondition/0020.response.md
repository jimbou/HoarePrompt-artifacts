Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `x` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in the `nums` list (`nums[n-1]`) that is greater than or equal to its previous value. The loop will have iterated over all elements in the `nums` list, and the value of `x` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `stdin`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
