Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `start_year` is updated to be the result of the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
2. Since `x` is 2, `nums[x]` is `nums[2]`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
3. `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[1]` greater than 0, so `start_year // nums[1]` is an integer.
4. `start_year // nums[x]` is an integer, so `start_year // nums[x] + 1` is also an integer.
5. The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is a multiple of `nums[x]`, so the new value of `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[x]`.

Now, let's update the output state:

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 3 elements, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[2]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `x` is 2**

Note that the value of `start_year` has changed, but its property of being a multiple of `nums[1]` is no longer guaranteed. Instead, it is now a multiple of `nums[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
