Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. 

The program iterates over each sign's periodicity and calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. It does this by dividing the current year by the sign's periodicity, rounding up to the nearest whole number, and then multiplying by the periodicity to get the next year. This effectively "waits" for the sign to occur before moving on to the next sign.

The program also correctly handles the case where the signs occur sequentially, as required by the problem statement. It does this by updating the current year after each sign's occurrence, ensuring that the next sign will occur after the previous one.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program is working as expected, as it correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the n integers and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
