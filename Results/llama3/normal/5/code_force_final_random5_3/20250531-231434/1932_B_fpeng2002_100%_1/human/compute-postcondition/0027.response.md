The only variables in the loop head are variable  x and list nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and list nums. If x is less than the length of the list nums, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 0, nums is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time the x is 1 and the list nums must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is either `nums[0]` or a multiple of `nums[0]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `x` is 1**
