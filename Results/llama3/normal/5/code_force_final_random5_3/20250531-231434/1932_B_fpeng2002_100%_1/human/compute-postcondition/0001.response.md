To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of `num_tests` since it is the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute if `num_tests` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. Since `num_tests` is already greater than 0 (it is between 1 and 1000), no adjustment is needed.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6)**
