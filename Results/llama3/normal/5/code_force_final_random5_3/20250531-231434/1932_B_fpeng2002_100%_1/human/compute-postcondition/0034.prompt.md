Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6)
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is n-1, and the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value which is `start_year` is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `x` is `n-1`, and the start year which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0 is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `x` is n-1, and the value of `start_year` which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0 is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
