Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged, `nums` still contains a list of integers, `start_year` is updated to be the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to its previous value, and `x` is now equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
