The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `x` is `n-1`, and the start year which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0 is being printed**
