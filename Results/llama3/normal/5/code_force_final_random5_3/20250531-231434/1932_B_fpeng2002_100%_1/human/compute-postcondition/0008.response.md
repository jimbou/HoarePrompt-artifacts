Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value. This is done by first dividing `start_year` by `nums[1]`, rounding down to the nearest integer, adding 1, and then multiplying by `nums[1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
