Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of sign periodicities, updating the start year for each sign to be the next multiple of the sign's periodicity after the previous sign's start year. This ensures that each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

*   Signs with different periodicities
*   Signs with the same periodicity
*   Signs with periodicities that are multiples of each other
*   Edge cases, such as a single sign or signs with periodicity 1

The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all the provided example inputs. Without a counterexample, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
