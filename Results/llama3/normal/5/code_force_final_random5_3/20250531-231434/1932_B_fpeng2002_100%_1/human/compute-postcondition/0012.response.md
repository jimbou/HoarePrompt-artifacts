To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `num_tests` since it's the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute again if `num_tests` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive. To guarantee the loop can execute again, we need to ensure `num_tests` is at least 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is n-1, and the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value which is `start_year` is being printed**
