The only variable in the loop head is variable x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and the length of the list nums. If x is less than the length of the list nums, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 0, nums is a list of at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again x must be 1 and for the loop to execute again nums must be a list of at least 2 integers.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 2 integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[0]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `x` is 1**
