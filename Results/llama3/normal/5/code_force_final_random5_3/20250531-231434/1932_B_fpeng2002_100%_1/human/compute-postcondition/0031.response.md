Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `x` is n-1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same constraints as the initial state for `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `stdin`. However, `start_year` will be a multiple of the last element in the `nums` list (`nums[n-1]`) greater than 0, and `x` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the `nums` list.
