Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[1]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `x` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be a multiple of `nums[1]` greater than 0, which is the result of the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
