Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[0]` and is greater than or equal to `nums[0]`, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[1]` and is greater than or equal to `nums[1]`, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is 1, `start_year` is updated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
