Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[0]` and is greater than or equal to `nums[0]`, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be a multiple of `nums[0]` and is greater than or equal to `nums[0]`. This is because the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
