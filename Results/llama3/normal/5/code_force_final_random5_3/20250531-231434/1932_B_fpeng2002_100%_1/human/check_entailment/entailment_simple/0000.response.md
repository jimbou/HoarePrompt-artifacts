Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. It initializes the `start_year` to 0, which represents the year when the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over each sign, updating the `start_year` to be the next multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`. This is done using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
5. After updating the `start_year` for all signs, the program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year when the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The program's logic is correct because it simulates the process of waiting for each sign to occur sequentially, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred. The formula used to update the `start_year` ensures that it is always a multiple of the current sign's periodicity, which is the correct behavior according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
