Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, x is n-1, and the start year which is a multiple of nums[n-1] greater than 0 is being printed**

The code block has the following effects on the program state:

*   The first line decrements `num_tests` by 1, reducing its value by 1.
*   The second line reads an integer from `stdin` and assigns it to `n`, updating its value.
*   The third line reads a list of `n` integers from `stdin`, separated by spaces, and assigns it to `nums`, updating its value.
*   The fourth line sets `start_year` to 0, overriding its previous value.

After executing the code block, the final state of the program is as follows:

*   `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, having been decremented by 1.
*   `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, having been updated with a new value from `stdin`.
*   `nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, having been updated with a new list of integers from `stdin`.
*   `start_year` is 0, having been set to 0 by the code.
*   `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, having been reduced by 2 test cases that were read by the code.
*   `x` is `n-1`, maintaining its relationship with `n`.
*   The start year, which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0, is being printed, but its value is not updated by the code.
