Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then enters a while loop to process each test case.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`) for the current test case.

3. It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the next sign is expected to occur.

4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign is expected to occur by using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula works by first dividing the current year by the periodicity of the sign and rounding down to the nearest whole number (`start_year // nums[x]`). It then adds 1 to this result to get the next multiple of the periodicity that is greater than the current year. Finally, it multiplies this result by the periodicity to get the actual year in which the sign is expected to occur.

5. After calculating the expected year for all signs, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
