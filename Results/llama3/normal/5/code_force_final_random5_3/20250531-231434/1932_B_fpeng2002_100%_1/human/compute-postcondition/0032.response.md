The code prints the value of `start_year` which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0.
Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n-1` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive.
`nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, so `nums[n-1]` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
`start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]`, so it is also an integer greater than 0.
However, the exact value of `start_year` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `nums[n-1]`.
Output: **a multiple of the last element of the list nums greater than 0**
