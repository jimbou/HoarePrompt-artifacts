Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 1 integer each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[0]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be a multiple of `nums[0]` greater than 0. This is because `start_year` was initially 0, and the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` evaluates to `nums[0]` when `start_year` is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
