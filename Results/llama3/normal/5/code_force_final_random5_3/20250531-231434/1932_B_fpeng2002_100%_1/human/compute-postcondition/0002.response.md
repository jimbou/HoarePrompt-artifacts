Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

Here's a breakdown of the changes made by the code:

1. `num_tests -= 1`: Decreases the value of `num_tests` by 1, so it's now an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive.

2. `n = int(input())`: Reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since each test case contains an integer `n` between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` will be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. Stdin now contains t-1 test cases.

3. `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]`: Reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and assigns the list to `nums`. Since each test case contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `nums` will be a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. Stdin still contains t-1 test cases.

4. `start_year = 0`: Assigns 0 to `start_year`. This variable was not present in the initial state, so it's added to the output state.

The final output state includes the updated values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`, as well as the new variable `start_year`. The state of stdin is also updated to reflect the remaining test cases.
