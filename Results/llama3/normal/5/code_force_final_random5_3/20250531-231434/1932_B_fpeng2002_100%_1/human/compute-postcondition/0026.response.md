Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is either `nums[0]` or a multiple of `nums[0]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` is either `nums[0]` or a multiple of `nums[0]` greater than 0, because `start_year` is initially 0 and then updated to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which is equivalent to `nums[0]` or a multiple of `nums[0]` greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
