Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and `x` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the number of tests (`num_tests`) will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `nums` will retain their last values from the input, representing the number of integers and the list of integers in the last test case, respectively. The `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last integer in the last test case that is greater than or equal to its previous value. The standard input (`stdin`) will be empty since all test cases have been read and processed. The loop counter `x` will be at its last value, which is `n-1`, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
