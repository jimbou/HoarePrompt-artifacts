The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and list nums. If x is less than the length of nums, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 1, nums is a list of at least 2 integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be 2 and the list must have at least 3 integers.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of at least 3 integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `start_year` is a multiple of `nums[1]` greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `x` is 2**
