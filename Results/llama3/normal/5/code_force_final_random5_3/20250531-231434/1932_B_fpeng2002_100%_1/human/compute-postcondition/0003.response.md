According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If the list `nums` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the x is 0.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `x` is 0**
