The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is a multiple of `nums[n-1]` greater than 0. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n-1` will be between 0 and 99 inclusive. `nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, so `nums[n-1]` will be an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. Therefore, `start_year` will be a multiple of an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, greater than 0.

Output: **a multiple of an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, greater than 0**
