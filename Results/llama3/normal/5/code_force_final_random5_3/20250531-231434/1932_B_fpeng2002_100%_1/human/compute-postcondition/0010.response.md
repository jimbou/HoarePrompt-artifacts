The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to its previous value.
Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and `x` is `n-1`, we can infer that `nums[n-1]` is the last element of the list `nums`.
However, without knowing the exact values of `nums` and `start_year`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`.
Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of the last element of the list nums that is greater than or equal to its previous value)**
