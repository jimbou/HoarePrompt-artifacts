This function determines the position of a target value k in a list of distinct integers arr. It first attempts to find the position of k in arr through a linear search. If k is found, the function prints 0. If k is not found, the function performs a binary search on arr to find the position where k should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order. The function then prints 1, followed by the position where k should be inserted (low + 1) and the position of k if it were present in the list (pos + 1).
