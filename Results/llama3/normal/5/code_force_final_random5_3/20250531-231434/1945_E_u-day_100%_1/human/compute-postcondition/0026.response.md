Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low + 1 is less than high, st is a set containing (low + high) // 2, mid, and (low + high) // 2, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k.**

The code calculates the value of `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`, and adds this value to the set `st`. The value of `mid` is now stored in `st`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
