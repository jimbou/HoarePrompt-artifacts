Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `low` is equal to `mid`, `high` is greater than `low`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid`, and `mid`, and `pos` is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `low` and `high` is still maintained, with `high` being greater than the new value of `low`. The set `st` still contains the same elements, and the value of `pos` depends on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`.
