Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, st is a set containing mid, mid, and mid, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k. If arr[mid] > k, then low + 1 is less than mid. Otherwise, low is equal to mid and high is greater than low.***
