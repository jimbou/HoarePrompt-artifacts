Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is 0, high is n, st is a set containing (low + high) // 2, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k. The current value of arr[mid] is greater than k.***
