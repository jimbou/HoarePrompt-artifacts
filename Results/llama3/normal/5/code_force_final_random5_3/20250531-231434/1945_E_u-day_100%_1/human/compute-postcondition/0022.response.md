Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low and high are updated based on the comparison of arr[mid] and k, st is a set containing (low + high) // 2 and mid, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k, and high is now equal to mid which is at least low + 1**

In this output state, the value of high has been updated to mid, which is at least low + 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The set st still contains (low + high) // 2 and mid, but since high is now equal to mid, (low + high) // 2 is also equal to mid. The value of pos is still either n-1 or its original value, depending on whether arr[i] equals k.
