To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `low` and `high` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `low + 1 < high` is still true. Since `i` is `n-1`, we know that `low` and `high` are already close to each other. To make sure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `low` and `high` so that `low + 1 < high` is still true.

One way to do this is to adjust `high` to be at least `low + 2`. This ensures that `low + 1 < high` is still true, and the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`, `st` is a set containing `(low + high) // 2`, and `pos` is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`, and `high` is at least `low + 2**
