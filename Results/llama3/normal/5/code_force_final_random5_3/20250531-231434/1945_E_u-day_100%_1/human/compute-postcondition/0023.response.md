Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `low` is equal to `mid`, `high` is at least `mid + 2`, `st` is a set containing `mid` and `mid`, and `pos` is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains distinct integers from 1 to n, and `i` is still at the second last index. The set `st` still contains the mid index, and `pos` is still either at the second last index or its original value depending on whether the element at the second last index is equal to `k`. The range defined by `low` and `high` has been updated, with `low` now being equal to `mid` and `high` being at least `mid + 2`.
