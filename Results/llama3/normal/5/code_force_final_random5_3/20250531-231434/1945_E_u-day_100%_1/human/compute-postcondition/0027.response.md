Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `low` + 1 is less than `mid`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid`, and `mid`, and `pos` is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `high` has been updated to `mid`, which means the search space has been reduced to the lower half of the original range. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and relationships. The set `st` still contains the same elements, and the value of `pos` is still dependent on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`.
