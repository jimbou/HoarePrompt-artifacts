The code prints the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Based on the precondition, `low` equals `high`, and since the element at index `low` in the array `arr` is not equal to `k`, `low` is incremented. Therefore, `low + 1` is equal to `high + 1`. Additionally, `pos` is either `n-1` or its original value depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`. Since `arr[i]` is not equal to `k`, `pos` remains its original value. Therefore, `pos + 1` is equal to the original value of `pos` plus 1.

Output: **high + 1, pos + 1 (where high is the value of high and pos is the original value of pos)**
