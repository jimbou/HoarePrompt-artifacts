Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm. In the while loop, the condition `low + 1 < high` is incorrect. It should be `low < high` instead. This is because the loop should continue until `low` and `high` converge, not until `low + 1` is less than `high`. This mistake can lead to incorrect results when the target element is at the last index of the array.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case when the target element is not found in the array. In this case, the program should print an error message or return a special value to indicate that the element was not found. However, the program simply prints the index of the last element that was checked, which is not correct.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
