Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 2, `pos` is 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `pos`, which is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2.
