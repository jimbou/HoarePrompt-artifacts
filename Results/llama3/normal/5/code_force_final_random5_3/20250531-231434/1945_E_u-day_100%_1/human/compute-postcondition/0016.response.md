Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is n-1, `low` is 0, `high` is (low + high) // 2, `st` is a set containing (low + high) // 2, and `pos` is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k. The current value of arr[mid] is greater than k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `high` has been updated to be the middle index of the current range `[low, high]`, which is `(low + high) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order, and the value of `arr[mid]` is still greater than `k`. The set `st` still contains the middle index `(low + high) // 2`. The value of `pos` is still either `n-1` or its original value, depending on whether `arr[i]` equals `k`.
