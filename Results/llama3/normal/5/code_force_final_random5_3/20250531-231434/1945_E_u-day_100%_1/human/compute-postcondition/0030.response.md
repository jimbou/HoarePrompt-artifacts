Output State: **low equals high, st is a set containing all integers from 0 to n-1, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k.**

The loop will continue to execute until low + 1 is no longer less than high. At this point, low and high will be equal, and the set st will contain all integers from 0 to n-1. The value of pos will remain unchanged, depending on whether arr[i] equals k.
