Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1. If the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, then pos is n-1. Otherwise, the state of pos remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has checked every element in the list `arr` to see if it matches the value of `k`. If a match is found, the index of that element is stored in `pos`. If no match is found after checking all elements, `pos` remains unchanged, which is -1.
