Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is 0, high is n, st is an empty set, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code introduced two new variables, `low` and `high`, which are assigned the values 0 and `n`, respectively. Additionally, an empty set `st` is created. The state of `pos` depends on the condition `arr[i] == k`, but since the code does not provide the specific values of `arr` and `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `pos`. Therefore, we describe it as either `n-1` or its original value, depending on the condition.
