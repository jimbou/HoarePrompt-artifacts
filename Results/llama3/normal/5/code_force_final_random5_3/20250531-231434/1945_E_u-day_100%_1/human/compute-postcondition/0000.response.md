Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, pos is -1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the return values of `func_1()`, which returns a tuple of two positive integers. The value of `arr` is updated based on the return value of `func_2()`, which returns a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order. The variable `pos` is assigned the value -1.
