Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is 0, high is n, st is a set containing (low + high) // 2, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k.**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`, which are 0 and `n`, respectively. This results in `mid` being equal to `n // 2`. The set `st` is updated to include the value of `mid`, which is `n // 2`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `i`, `low`, `high`, and `pos` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
