Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search. However, the permutation is not sorted, and the program is allowed to perform at most 2 operations (swapping elements) before running the binary search algorithm.

The program first finds the position `pos` of the target number `x` in the permutation. Then, it performs a binary search on the permutation, but with a twist. Instead of updating the `low` and `high` variables based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `x`, it updates them based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `x`. This is because the permutation is not sorted, and the program wants to find the first element that is less than or equal to `x`.

The program uses a set `st` to keep track of the indices that have been visited during the binary search. However, this set is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be removed.

After the binary search, the program checks if the element at the `low` index is equal to `x`. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no operations are needed. Otherwise, the program prints 1, indicating that one operation is needed, and prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which are the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

The program does not handle the case where the target number `x` is not found in the permutation. In this case, the program will print incorrect results.

However, based on the problem description, it is guaranteed that the target number `x` is present in the permutation. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
