Output State: **n is greater than 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1, low is (low + high) // 2, high is n, st is a set containing (low + high) // 2, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k. The element at the mid index of arr is less than or equal to k.**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to `(low + high) // 2`, which is the mid index of the array `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the element at the mid index of `arr` is less than or equal to `k` still holds.
