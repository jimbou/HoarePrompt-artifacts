Postcondition: ***low equals high, st is a set containing all integers from 0 to n-1, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, 1 is printed, low + 1 (where low equals high) and pos + 1 (where pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k) are printed.***
