Output: **low equals high, st is a set containing all integers from 0 to n-1, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k. The element at index low in the array arr is not equal to k, and 1 is being printed, and this is printed: low + 1 (where low equals high) and pos + 1 (where pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k)**
