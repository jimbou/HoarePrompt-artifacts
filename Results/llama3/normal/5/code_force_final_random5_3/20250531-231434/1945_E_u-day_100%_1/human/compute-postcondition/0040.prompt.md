You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, func_1() returns a tuple of two positive integers, and func_2() returns a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order.
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, i is n-1. If the current value of arr[i] is equal to k, then pos is n-1. Otherwise, the state of pos remains unchanged.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low equals high, st is a set containing all integers from 0 to n-1, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: high + 1, pos + 1 (where high is the value of high and pos is the original value of pos)
    #State: *low equals high, st is a set containing all integers from 0 to n-1, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, 1 is printed, low + 1 (where low equals high) and pos + 1 (where pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k) are printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: low equals high, st is a set containing all integers from 0 to n-1, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k. The current value of arr[low] is equal to k, and the number 0 is being printed

Case_2: low equals high, st is a set containing all integers from 0 to n-1, and pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k. The element at index low in the array arr is not equal to k, and 1 is being printed, and this is printed: low + 1 (where low equals high) and pos + 1 (where pos is either n-1 or its original value depending on whether arr[i] equals k)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
