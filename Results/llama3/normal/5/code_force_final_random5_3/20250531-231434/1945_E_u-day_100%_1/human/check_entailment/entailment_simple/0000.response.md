Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the position of the target number `k` in the permutation `arr`. It first finds the position of `k` in the array and then performs the binary search. If `k` is found at the correct position, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 and the positions of the two elements that need to be swapped to make the binary search work correctly.

The program correctly handles the case where `k` is not found in the array by printing 1 and the positions of the two elements that need to be swapped.

The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is found at the correct position by printing 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
