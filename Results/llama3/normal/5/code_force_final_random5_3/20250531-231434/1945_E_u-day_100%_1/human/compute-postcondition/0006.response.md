Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1. If the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `pos` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the value of `pos` when `arr[i]` is equal to `k` is still applicable, but now `pos` is 1 instead of 0.
