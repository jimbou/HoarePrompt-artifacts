Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the case where the target value is not found in the list. The program also correctly prints the position where the target value should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The use of a set to keep track of the indices visited during the binary search is unnecessary, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
