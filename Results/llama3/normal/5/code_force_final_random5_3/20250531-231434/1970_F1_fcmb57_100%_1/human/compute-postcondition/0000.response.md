Output State: **a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings, x is the first integer in a, y is the second integer in a, dx is the first string in b, dy is the second string in b.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning values to two variables from the lists `a` and `b`. The first line assigns the first and second elements of list `a` to `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `a` is a list of two integers, `x` and `y` become integers. The second line assigns the first and second elements of list `b` to `dx` and `dy`, respectively. Since `b` is a list of strings, `dx` and `dy` become strings. The original lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
