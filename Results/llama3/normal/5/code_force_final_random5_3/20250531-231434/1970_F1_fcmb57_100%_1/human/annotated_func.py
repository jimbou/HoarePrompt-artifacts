#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is the sum of the first integer in list 'a' and the first string in list 'b'. The second value is the sum of the second integer in list 'a' and the second string in list 'b'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input. It then returns a tuple containing the sum of the first integer in 'a' and the first string in 'b', and the sum of the second integer in 'a' and the second string in 'b'. The function does not modify the input lists.
