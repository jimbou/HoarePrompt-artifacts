Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers t, f, and k (1 <= t, f, k <= 100). The second line contains t integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0, f is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index f in the original list a, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the current value of the element at index k in list a is greater than the current value of x, 'NO' is printed. If the element at index k in list a is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If the element at index k in list a is less than or equal to x, either 'YES' if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k - 1 in list a is less than x, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, f is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index f in the list a, _ is 1, stdin is empty. If a[k] is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If a[k] is less than or equal to x, 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k - 1 in the list a is less than x; otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, f is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index f in the list a, _ is 2, stdin is empty. If the element at index k in the list a is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If the element at index k in the list a is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If the element at index k in the list a is equal to x, then if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k - 1 in the list a is less than x, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
