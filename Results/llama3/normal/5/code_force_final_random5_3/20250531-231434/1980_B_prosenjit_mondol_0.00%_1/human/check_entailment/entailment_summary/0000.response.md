Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not. The program sorts the list of cube values in descending order, then compares the kth element (which is the last element that will be removed) with the value of the favorite cube. If the kth element is greater than the favorite cube, it prints 'NO', indicating that the favorite cube will not be removed. If the kth element is less than or equal to the favorite cube, it checks if k is the last index or if the element before the kth is less than the favorite cube. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES', indicating that the favorite cube will be removed. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE', indicating that the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

Correctness: **True**
