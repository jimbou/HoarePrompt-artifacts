The code prints 'YES' if the value of k is equal to n - 1 or if the value of the element at index k - 1 in the list a is less than the value of x. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. Here, x is the value of the element at index f in the list a.

Output: **YES if k equals n - 1 or the value of the element at index k - 1 in the list a is less than the value of the element at index f in the list a, MAYBE otherwise**
