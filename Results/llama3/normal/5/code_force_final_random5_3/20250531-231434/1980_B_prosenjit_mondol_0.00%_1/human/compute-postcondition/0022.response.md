Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, f is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index f in the list a, _ is 1, stdin is empty. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k - 1 in the list a is less than x, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'MAYBE' is printed.***
