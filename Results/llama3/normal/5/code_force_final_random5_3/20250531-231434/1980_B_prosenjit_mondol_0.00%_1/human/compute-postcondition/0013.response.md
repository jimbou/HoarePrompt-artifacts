Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, f is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of the element at index f in the original list a, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the current value of the element at index k in list a is greater than the current value of x, 'NO' is printed. If the element at index k in list a is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If the element at index k in list a is less than or equal to x, either 'YES' if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k - 1 in list a is less than x, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.***
