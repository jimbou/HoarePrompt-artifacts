Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the favorite cube has the same value as the k-th cube, but there are other cubes with the same value that are not removed. In this case, the program will print 'YES' if the favorite cube is removed, but it should print 'MAYBE' because it is possible that the favorite cube is not removed.

For example, if n=5, f=2, a=[4, 3, 3, 2, 3], and k=2, the program will print 'YES' because a[k] == x, but it should print 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube can be either removed or not removed depending on the order of the cubes with the same value.
