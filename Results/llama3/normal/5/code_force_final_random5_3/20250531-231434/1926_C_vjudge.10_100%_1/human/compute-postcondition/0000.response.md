Output State: **t is a positive integer, values is a list of 200001 zeros, stdin contains a sequence of integers (each representing the largest number Vladislav writes).**

The code snippet reads the number of test cases from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. It then creates a list `values` of size `inf` (which is 200001) initialized with zeros. The state of `stdin` is updated to contain a sequence of integers, each representing the largest number Vladislav writes. The value of `t` is a positive integer, and the list `values` contains 200001 zeros.
