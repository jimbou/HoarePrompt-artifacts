Output: **`t` is at least 1, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `value` is an integer read from the input sequence and is equal to the integer read from the input sequence, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list is being printed, which is equal to `values[value - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `value`, and `value` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the input sequence and `int` converts it to an integer, and this is printed: `values[value]` which is equal to `values[value - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `value`**
