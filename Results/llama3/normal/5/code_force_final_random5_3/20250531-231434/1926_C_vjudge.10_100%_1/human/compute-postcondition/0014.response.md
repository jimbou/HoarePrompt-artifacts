To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `i`. According to the code, `x` is an iteration variable that takes on each character (digit) of the string representation of `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must have at least one digit.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `x` is the first digit of `i`**
