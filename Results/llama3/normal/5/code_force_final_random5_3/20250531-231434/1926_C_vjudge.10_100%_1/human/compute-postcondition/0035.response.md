To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is a positive integer, we can adjust its state to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`**
