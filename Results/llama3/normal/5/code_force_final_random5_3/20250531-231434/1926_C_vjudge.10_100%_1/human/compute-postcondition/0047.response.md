Output State: **t is 0, values is a list of 200001 integers where values[i] is equal to values[i - 1] plus the sum of all digits of i, values[0] to values[199999] are zeros, values[200000] is not zero, stdin contains a sequence of integers, i is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, x is the last digit of i, sum_value_digits is equal to the sum of all digits of i, and value is the last integer read from the input sequence, and the value at index value in the values list is being printed, which is equal to values[value - 1] plus the sum of all digits of value.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of t is now 0. The values list remains unchanged, with the same properties as before. The stdin still contains a sequence of integers, and the variables i, x, and sum_value_digits retain their previous values. The variable value holds the last integer read from the input sequence, and the value at index value in the values list is being printed, which is equal to values[value - 1] plus the sum of all digits of value.
