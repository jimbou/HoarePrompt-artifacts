Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 100 and has at least 3 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the first digit of `i`, the second digit of `i`, and the third digit of `i`, `x` is the third digit of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated to include the third digit of `i`, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `sum_value_digits` is now the sum of the first digit, second digit, and third digit of `i`.
