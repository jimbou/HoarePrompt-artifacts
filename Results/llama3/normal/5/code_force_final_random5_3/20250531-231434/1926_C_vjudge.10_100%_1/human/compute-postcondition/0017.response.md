Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 2 and has at least 2 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the first two digits of `i`, `x` is the second digit of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated to be the sum of the first two digits of `i`, since `x` is the second digit of `i` and `sum_value_digits` was initially equal to the first digit of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
