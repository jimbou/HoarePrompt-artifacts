To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in str(i):`. This means we're iterating over the digits of the integer `i` as a string.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `i` has at least 2 digits.
* `x` is the second digit of `i`.
* `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the first digit of `i` and the second digit of `i`.

To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next digit of `i`. Since `x` is the second digit, the next digit would be the third digit of `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be the third digit of `i`.

Additionally, since we're moving to the next digit, we need to update `sum_value_digits` to be the sum of the second digit of `i` and the third digit of `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `values`, `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` has at least 3 digits, `x` is the third digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the second digit of `i` and the third digit of `i`.**
