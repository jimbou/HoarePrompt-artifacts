Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` has at least 1 digit, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer, the list `values` remains unchanged with all elements being zeros, `stdin` still contains a sequence of integers, `i` has at least one digit, `x` is now the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is now the sum of all digits of `i`.
