Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    value = int(input())
    print(values[value])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `value` is an integer read from the input sequence, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list is being printed, which is equal to `values[value - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `value`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `value` is an integer read from the input sequence and is equal to the integer read from the input sequence, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list is being printed, which is equal to `values[value - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `value`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `value` is an integer read from the input sequence and is equal to the integer read from the input sequence, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list is being printed, which is equal to `values[value - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `value`, and `value` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the input sequence and `int` converts it to an integer, and this is printed: `values[value]` which is equal to `values[value - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `value`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
