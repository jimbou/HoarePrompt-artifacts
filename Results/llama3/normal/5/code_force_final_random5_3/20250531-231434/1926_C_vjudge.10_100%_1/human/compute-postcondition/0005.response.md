The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has at least 2 digits the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 10, `x` is the first digit of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `i` must have at least 2 digits and the `x` is the second digit of `i`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 10 and has at least 2 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the first digit of `i`, `x` is the second digit of `i`.**
