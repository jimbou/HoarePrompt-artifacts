Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 3 and has at least 3 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the first three digits of `i` plus the third digit of `i`, `x` is the third digit of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated by adding the third digit of `i` to its previous value, which was the sum of the first three digits of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
