Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of digits for each number from 1 to 200000 in a list. This allows it to efficiently calculate the sum of digits for each test case by simply looking up the precomputed value.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem description accurately. It reads the number of test cases, precomputes the sum of digits for each number, and then prints the sum of digits for each test case. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. The function `func_1()` is defined after it is called. In Python, you need to define a function before you can call it. This will cause a `NameError` when trying to run the program.

Correctness: **False**
