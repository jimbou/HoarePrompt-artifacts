The only object in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has at least 3 digits the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2 and has at least 2 digits, `x` is the second digit of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `i` must have at least 3 digits and the `x` is the third digit of `i`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 3 and has at least 3 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the first three digits of `i`, `x` is the third digit of `i`.**
