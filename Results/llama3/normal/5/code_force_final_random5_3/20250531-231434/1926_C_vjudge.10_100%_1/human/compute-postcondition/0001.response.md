The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer and `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, and `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, but these do not ensure that the loop will execute, so `i` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 1**
