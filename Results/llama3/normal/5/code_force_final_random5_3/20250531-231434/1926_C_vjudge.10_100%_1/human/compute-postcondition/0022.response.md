Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i`. The value of `values[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `values[i - 1]` and `sum_value_digits`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the value of `values[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous value of `values[i - 1]` and the sum of all digits of `i`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
