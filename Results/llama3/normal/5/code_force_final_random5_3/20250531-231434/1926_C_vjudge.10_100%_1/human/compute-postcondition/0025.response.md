According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is at least 3 and has at least 1 digit, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` has at least 1 digit and `x` is the first digit of `i`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` has at least 1 digit, `x` is the first digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is 0**
