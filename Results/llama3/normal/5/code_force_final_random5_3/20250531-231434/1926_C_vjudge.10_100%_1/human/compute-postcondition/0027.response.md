The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has at least 2 digits, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has at least 1 digit, `x` is the first digit of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `i` must have at least 2 digits and the `x` is the second digit of `i`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` has at least 2 digits, `x` is the second digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the first digit of `i`**
