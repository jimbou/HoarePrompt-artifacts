Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `value` is an integer read from the input sequence.**

In this output state, the value of `value` is an integer read from the input sequence, which was previously stored in `stdin`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial properties. The input sequence in `stdin` has been reduced by one integer, as it was consumed by the `input()` function.
