Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` has at least 1 digit, `x` is the first digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the first digit of `i`**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated to be equal to the first digit of `i`, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `values` still contains 200001 integers, with the first `i+1` elements being zeros, and the rest of the elements being the sum of the previous element and the sum of the digits of the index. The input `stdin` still contains a sequence of integers, and `i` still has at least one digit. The value of `t` is still a positive integer.
