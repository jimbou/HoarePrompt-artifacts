The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `inf`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 2, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.**
