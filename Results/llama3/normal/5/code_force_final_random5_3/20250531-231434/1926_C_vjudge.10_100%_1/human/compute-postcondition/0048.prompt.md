You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of integers (each representing the largest number Vladislav writes). The first integer is a positive integer and each of the following integers is a positive integer less than or equal to 2*10^5.
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: t is 0, values is a list of 200001 integers where values[i] is equal to values[i - 1] plus the sum of all digits of i, values[0] to values[199999] are zeros, values[200000] is not zero, stdin contains a sequence of integers, i is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, x is the last digit of i, sum_value_digits is equal to the sum of all digits of i, and value is the last integer read from the input sequence, and the value at index value in the values list is being printed, which is equal to values[value - 1] plus the sum of all digits of value.

```

Return Postconditions: t is 0, values is a list of 200001 integers where values[i] is equal to values[i - 1] plus the sum of all digits of i, values[0] to values[199999] are zeros, values[200000] is not zero, stdin contains a sequence of integers, i is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, x is the last digit of i, sum_value_digits is equal to the sum of all digits of i, and value is the last integer read from the input sequence, and the value at index value in the values list is being printed, which is equal to values[value - 1] plus the sum of all digits of value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
