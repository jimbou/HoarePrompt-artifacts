Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` has at least 3 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the program is such that `t` remains a positive integer, the `values` list remains unchanged with all elements from index 0 to `i` being zeros, and `stdin` still contains a sequence of integers. The variable `i` has at least 3 digits, and `x` has taken on the value of the last digit of `i`. Most importantly, `sum_value_digits` now holds the sum of all the digits of `i`, indicating that the loop has successfully iterated over each digit of `i` and accumulated their sum.
