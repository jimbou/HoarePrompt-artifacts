Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the first digit of `i`, `x` is the first digit of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated to be equal to the first digit of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `values` still contains 200001 integers, where each element is the sum of the previous element and the sum of the digits of its index. The first `i+1` elements of `values` are still zeros. The input buffer `stdin` still contains a sequence of integers. The variable `i` is still at least 2 and has at least 1 digit. The variable `x` is still the first digit of `i`.
