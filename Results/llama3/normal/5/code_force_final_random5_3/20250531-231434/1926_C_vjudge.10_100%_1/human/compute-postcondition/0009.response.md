Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 1, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer, `values` remains a list of 200001 zeros, and `stdin` still contains a sequence of integers. The variable `i` is at least 1, and `sum_value_digits` is now equal to the sum of all digits of `i`. The variable `x` is the last digit of `i`.
