The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `value` is an integer read from the input sequence, and the value at index `value` in the `values` list is being printed, which is equal to `values[value - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `value`.**
