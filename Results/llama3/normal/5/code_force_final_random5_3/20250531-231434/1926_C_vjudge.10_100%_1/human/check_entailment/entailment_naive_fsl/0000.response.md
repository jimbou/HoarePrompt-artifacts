Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to pre-calculate the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 2 * 10^5, and then uses this pre-calculated array to quickly calculate the sum for each test case.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the edge cases where n is 1, 2, or 3, as well as larger values of n. The program also correctly handles the case where n is equal to 2 * 10^5, which is the maximum possible value of n.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the maximum possible value of n, which is 2 * 10^5. This is within the allowed time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem for all potential cases.
