Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 10 and has at least 2 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the first digit of `i` and the second digit of `i`, `x` is the second digit of `i`.**

Explanation: The code increments `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`, which is the second digit of `i`. Since `sum_value_digits` was initially equal to the first digit of `i`, it now becomes the sum of the first digit of `i` and the second digit of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
