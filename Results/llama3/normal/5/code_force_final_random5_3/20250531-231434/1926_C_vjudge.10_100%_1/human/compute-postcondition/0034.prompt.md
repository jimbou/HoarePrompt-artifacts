Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, values is a list of 200001 zeros, stdin contains a sequence of integers (each representing the largest number Vladislav writes).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, inf):
    sum_value_digits = 0
    for x in str(i):
        sum_value_digits += int(x)
    values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i-1]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 1, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i`. The value of `values[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `values[i - 1]` and `sum_value_digits`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i-1]` are zeros, `values[i]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` has at least 3 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
