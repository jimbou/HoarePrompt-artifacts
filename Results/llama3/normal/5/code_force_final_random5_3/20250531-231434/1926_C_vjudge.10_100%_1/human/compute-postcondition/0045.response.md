The code prints the value at index `value` in the `values` list, which is equal to `values[value - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `value`. Since `value` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the input sequence and `int` converts it to an integer, the value printed is the value at index `value` in the `values` list, which is equal to `values[value - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `value`.

Output: **values[value - 1] + sum_value_digits (where value is the integer read from the input sequence, values[value - 1] is the value at index value - 1 in the values list, and sum_value_digits is the sum of all digits of value)**
