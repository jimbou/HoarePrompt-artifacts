To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in range(1, inf):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

Given that `i` is at least 2 and has at least 1 digit at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 3 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i`.**
