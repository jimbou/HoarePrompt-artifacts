Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 10, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the first digit of `i`, `x` is the first digit of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated to be equal to the first digit of `i`, which is also the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The first digit of `i` is a single digit integer between 1 and 9, because `i` is at least 10.
