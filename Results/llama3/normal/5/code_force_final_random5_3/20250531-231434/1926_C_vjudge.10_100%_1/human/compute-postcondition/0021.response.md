Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer, `values` remains a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i`.
