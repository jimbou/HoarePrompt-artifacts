Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[199999]` are zeros, `values[200000]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `values` has been updated such that each element `values[i]` is the sum of the previous element `values[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`. The first 199999 elements of `values` are zeros, and the last element `values[200000]` is not zero. The variable `i` has reached at least 200000 and has at least 6 digits. The variable `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i`. The other variables, `t` and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
