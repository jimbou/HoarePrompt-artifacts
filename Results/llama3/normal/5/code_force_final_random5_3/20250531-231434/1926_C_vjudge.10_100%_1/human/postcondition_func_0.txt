The function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents the largest number Vladislav writes. It then calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to 200000 and stores these sums in a list. For each test case, it prints the sum of digits for the given number. The function does not modify the input sequence or any external state, and its output is solely based on the input values.
