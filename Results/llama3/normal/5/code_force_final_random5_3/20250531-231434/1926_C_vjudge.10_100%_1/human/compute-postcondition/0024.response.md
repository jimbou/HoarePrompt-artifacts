Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i]` are zeros, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` is at least 3 and has at least 1 digit, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `values` still contains 200001 integers, with the first `i+1` elements being zeros, and the rest of the elements being the sum of the previous element and the sum of all digits of the index. The variable `i` is still at least 3 and has at least 1 digit, and `x` is still the last digit of `i`. The `stdin` still contains a sequence of integers.
