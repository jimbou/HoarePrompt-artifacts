Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1]` plus the sum of all digits of `i`, `values[0]` to `values[i-1]` are zeros, `values[i]` is not zero, `stdin` contains a sequence of integers, `i` has at least 3 digits, `x` is the last digit of `i`, and `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`.**

In natural language, after the code executes, the state of the program is such that `t` remains a positive integer, the `values` list remains unchanged with all elements from index 0 to `i-1` being zeros, but `values[i]` is now updated to be the sum of `values[i - 1]` and `sum_value_digits`. The `stdin` still contains a sequence of integers. The variable `i` still has at least 3 digits, and `x` still has taken on the value of the last digit of `i`. Most importantly, `sum_value_digits` still holds the sum of all the digits of `i`, indicating that the code has successfully updated the `values` list with the accumulated sum of the digits of `i`.
