Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 99, `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of non-negative integers less than or equal to 99, in ascending order**.

In this output state, the list `lst` remains unchanged, still containing non-negative integers less than or equal to 99. A new list `sorted_lst` is created, which is a sorted version of `lst` in ascending order. The sorting is done using the built-in `sorted` function, which returns a new sorted list without modifying the original list.
