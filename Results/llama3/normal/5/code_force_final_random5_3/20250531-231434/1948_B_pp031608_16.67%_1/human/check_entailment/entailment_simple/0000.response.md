Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, but based on the comment, it seems to check if the list is sorted in ascending order. However, the main issue lies in the logic of the program.

The program tries to split the previous element into two digits when it encounters an element that is smaller than the previous one and the previous element is greater than 10. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider all possible cases. 

For example, consider the list [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is correct. However, if the list is [12, 28, 5], the program will not be able to make it sorted because it only splits the previous element when it encounters a smaller element, but it does not consider the case where the current element is greater than the next element.

A correct approach would be to iterate through the list from the end to the beginning and split the current element into two digits whenever it is greater than the next element and greater than 10.

Correctness: **False**
