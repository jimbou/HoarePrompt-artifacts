Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will split the first element 12 into 1 and 2, resulting in the list [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. However, it will not split the element 45 into 4 and 5, even though it is possible to do so and get a sorted list. The program will incorrectly print "No" for this input.

The issue is that the program only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10, and if so, it splits the previous element. However, it does not recursively check if the resulting list can be sorted by splitting elements. It only checks if the list is sorted after splitting the previous element, which is not sufficient.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to recursively check if the list can be sorted by splitting elements, not just check if the previous element can be split.
