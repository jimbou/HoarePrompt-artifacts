Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the list is sorted after the first operation, but it does not continue to check if the list is sorted after subsequent operations. 

In the problem description, it is stated that the operation can be performed any number of times (possibly zero). However, the program only performs the operation once and then checks if the list is sorted. If the list is not sorted after the first operation, the program will print 'No', even if it is possible to make the list sorted with additional operations.

For example, if the input is [12, 3, 45, 67], the program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not split the third element into [4, 5, 67] because it only checks if the list is sorted after the first operation.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
