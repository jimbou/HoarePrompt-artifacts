Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-descending order using the operation of deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted in ascending order. The main part of the program iterates through the list, and if it finds a pair of elements that are not in ascending order, it checks if the previous element is greater than 10. If it is, the program splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them into the list.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only checks if the previous element is greater than 10 and splits it if necessary. But it does not consider the case where the current element is greater than 10 and can be split to make the list sorted.

For example, consider the list `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split the first element into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it will not split the third element `45` into `[4, 5]` to make the list sorted.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
