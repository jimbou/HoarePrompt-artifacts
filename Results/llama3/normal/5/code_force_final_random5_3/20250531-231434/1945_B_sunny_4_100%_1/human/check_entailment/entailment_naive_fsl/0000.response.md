Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The issue lies in the line where the answer is calculated: `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`. The addition of 2 is incorrect, as it assumes that there will always be at least two fireworks visible in the sky, which is not necessarily true.

A counterexample is when `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `m = 1`. In this case, the program will output `4`, but the correct answer is `2`, because only two fireworks will be visible in the sky at the same time.

The correct calculation should be `ans = m // a + m // b + 1`, without the extra addition of 1. This is because the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation in the time interval `m`, plus one for the possibility that both installations launch a firework at the same time.
