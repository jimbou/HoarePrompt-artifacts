The code reads an integer `t` from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from stdin. It calculates `A` as the integer division of `m` by `a` plus 1, and `B` as the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 1. It then prints the sum of `A` and `B`.

After the loop finishes, stdin is empty.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin is empty**
