The only variable in the loop head is variable `qi` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `qi` and `t`. If `qi` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `qi` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `qi` must be increased by 1, so `qi` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `qi` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is an integer equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`, `stdin` is empty**
