Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, qi is t-1, a is an integer, b is an integer, m is an integer, ans is an integer equal to m // a + m // b + 2, stdin is empty, and the value of ans which is equal to m // a + m // b + 2 is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains the same as in the initial state, `qi` has reached its final value which is one less than `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are still integers, `ans` is still an integer equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`, the standard input is empty, and the final value of `ans` is being printed.
