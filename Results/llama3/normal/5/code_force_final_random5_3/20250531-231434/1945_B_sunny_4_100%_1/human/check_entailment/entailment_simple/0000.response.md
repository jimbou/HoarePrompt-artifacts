Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The program is adding 2 to the sum of the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation. This is incorrect because the problem statement does not guarantee that there will be at least two fireworks visible at the same time. In fact, the problem statement explicitly states that if one firework was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one minute. Therefore, the correct program should only print the sum of the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation.

Correctness: **False**
