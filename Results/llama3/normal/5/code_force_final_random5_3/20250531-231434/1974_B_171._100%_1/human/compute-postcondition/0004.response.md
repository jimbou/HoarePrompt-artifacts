Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `char_map` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the value of `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` is updated to `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the `encoded` string remains unchanged, the `unique_chars` list remains unchanged, the `char_map` dictionary has its second key-value pair updated, and the values of `len_unique` and `i` remain unchanged.
