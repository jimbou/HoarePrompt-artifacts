To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(len_unique):`.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `len_unique`. If `i` is less than `len_unique`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `len_unique` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `len_unique` remains the same.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `char_map` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
