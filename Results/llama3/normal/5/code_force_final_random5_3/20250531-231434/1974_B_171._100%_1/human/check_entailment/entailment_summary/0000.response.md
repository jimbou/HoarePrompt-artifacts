Reasoning: 

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the length of each string, and the strings themselves.

2. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string, sorts them in alphabetical order, and creates a character mapping where each character is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters.

4. The program then uses this character mapping to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character, effectively reversing the encoding process.

5. The program correctly handles repeated characters in the input string by preserving their original order in the decoded string.

6. The program prints the decoded strings for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding process described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
