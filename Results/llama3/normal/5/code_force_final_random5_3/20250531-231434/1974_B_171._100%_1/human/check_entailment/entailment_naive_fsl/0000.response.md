Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` itself.
2. The `func_1` function takes an encoded string `b` as input and performs the following steps:
	* It creates a set of unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order. This gives the auxiliary string `r` described in the problem statement.
	* It creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`).
	* It uses the `char_map` dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character, effectively decoding the string.
3. The decoded string is then returned and printed for each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters
* Strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order
* Strings with a single character
* Strings with multiple characters

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
