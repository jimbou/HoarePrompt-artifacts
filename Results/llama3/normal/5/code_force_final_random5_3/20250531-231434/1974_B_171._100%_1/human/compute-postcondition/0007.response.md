Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `char_map` is a dictionary with `len_unique` key-value pairs where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 0, `i` is `len_unique - 1`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `encoded` string remains unchanged, the `unique_chars` list remains sorted and unchanged, and the `char_map` dictionary has been populated with `len_unique` key-value pairs, where each key is a unique character from `encoded` and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored index in `unique_chars`. The loop has iterated `len_unique` times, and the final value of `i` is `len_unique - 1`.
