Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a given string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` itself.

2. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order. This is done using the `sorted(set(encoded))` expression, which correctly generates the auxiliary string `r` as described in the problem statement.

4. The program then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character to its symmetric character in the auxiliary string `r`. This is done by iterating over the indices of the unique characters and mapping each character to the character at the mirrored index from the end of the list. This correctly implements the encoding algorithm's replacement rule.

5. The program then uses a generator expression to iterate over each character `ch` in the encoded string `b` and replaces it with its corresponding symmetric character from the `char_map` dictionary. The resulting decoded characters are joined together into a single string using the `''.join(...)` method.

6. Finally, the program appends the decoded string to the `results` list and prints each decoded string after processing all test cases.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
