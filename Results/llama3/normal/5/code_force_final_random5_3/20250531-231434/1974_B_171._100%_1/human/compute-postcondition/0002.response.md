Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**.

In this output state, the dictionary `char_map` has been updated with a new key-value pair. The key is the character at index `i` (which is 0) in the sorted list of unique characters `unique_chars`, and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` (which is the last index in the list) in `unique_chars`. The other variables remain unchanged.
