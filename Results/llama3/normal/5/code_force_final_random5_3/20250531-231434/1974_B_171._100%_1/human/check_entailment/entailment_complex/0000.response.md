Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an encoded string `b` as input and returns the original string `s` from which the encoding result `b` was obtained.

The program first creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character in the encoded string to its corresponding character at the mirrored index in the sorted list of unique characters. This is done by iterating over the sorted list of unique characters and assigning each character to its corresponding character at the mirrored index.

Then, the program uses this dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character in the dictionary. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over each character in the encoded string and replaces it with its corresponding character in the dictionary.

Finally, the program returns the decoded string, which is the original string `s` from which the encoding result `b` was obtained.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string contains repeated characters, as the dictionary `char_map` preserves the original order of repeated characters.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
