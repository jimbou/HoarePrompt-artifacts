According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len_unique`. If `len_unique` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, and `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `len_unique` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `len_unique` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
