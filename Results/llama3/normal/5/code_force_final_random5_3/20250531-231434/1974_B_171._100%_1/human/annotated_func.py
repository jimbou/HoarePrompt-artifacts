#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `char_map` is a dictionary with `len_unique` key-value pairs where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 0, `i` is `len_unique - 1`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string 'decoded' where each character is replaced by its corresponding character in the dictionary 'char_map', which maps each unique character in 'encoded' to its corresponding character at the mirrored index in the sorted list of unique characters 'unique_chars'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a string of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character is replaced by its corresponding character at the mirrored index in the sorted list of unique characters from the input string. The function effectively reverses the order of unique characters in the input string, while preserving the original order of repeated characters.
