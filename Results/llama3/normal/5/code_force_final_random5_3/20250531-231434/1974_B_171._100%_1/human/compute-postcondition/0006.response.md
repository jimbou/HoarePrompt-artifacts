Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `char_map` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `char_map[unique_chars[2]]` is updated to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - 2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `encoded` remains unchanged, the list `unique_chars` remains the same, the dictionary `char_map` has been updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the third character in `unique_chars` and the value is the third character from the end in `unique_chars`, the length of `unique_chars` is still greater than 1, and the value of `i` is still 2.
