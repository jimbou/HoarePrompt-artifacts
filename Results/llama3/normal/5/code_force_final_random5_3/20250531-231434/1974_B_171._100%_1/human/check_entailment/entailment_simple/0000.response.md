Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The program first constructs a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character in the encoded string to its corresponding character at the mirrored index in the sorted list of unique characters. Then, it uses this dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of a dictionary to map characters to their decoded counterparts is efficient and effective. The program also correctly handles the case where the input string contains duplicate characters, as the `set` function is used to get the unique characters.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
