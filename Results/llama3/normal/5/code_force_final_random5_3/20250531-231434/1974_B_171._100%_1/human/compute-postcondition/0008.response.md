Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `char_map` is a dictionary with `len_unique` key-value pairs where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is greater than 0, `i` is `len_unique - 1`, `decoded` is a string where each character is replaced by its corresponding character in `char_map`.**

In this output state, the `decoded` variable is a new string where each character from the `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character in the `char_map` dictionary. The `char_map` dictionary maps each unique character in the `encoded` string to its corresponding character at the mirrored index in the `unique_chars` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
