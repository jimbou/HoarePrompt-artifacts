According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range `4`. If `i` is less than `4`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 3, which is less than 4, so the loop can execute. The state of `i` needs to be adjusted to be the starting value of the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `n` currently must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, `i` is 0, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points is being printed**
