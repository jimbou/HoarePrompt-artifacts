According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-6 test cases, coord is a list containing the coordinates (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 1, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed.**
