Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is an empty list, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3, the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed, and stdin contains t-9 test cases, and res is printed.**

The code resets the values of `coord` and `res` to an empty list and 0, respectively. The values of `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has already been printed, and `res` is also printed.
