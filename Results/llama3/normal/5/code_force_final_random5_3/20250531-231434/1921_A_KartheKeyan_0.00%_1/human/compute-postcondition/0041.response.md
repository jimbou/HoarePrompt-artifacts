Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates (x, y) representing the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The function then calculates the area of the square by finding the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points. Finally, it prints the calculated area for each test case.**
