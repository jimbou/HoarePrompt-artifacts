Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus t and n is currently equal to 0, coord is a sorted list containing four pairs of coordinates (x, y), res is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3, and stdin contains 0 test cases, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed t times.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed t times, and the loop has finished executing. The value of n has been decremented t times and is now equal to 0. The coord list contains the last set of four pairs of coordinates (x, y) that were input. The res variable contains the last calculated absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points. The p1 and p2 variables contain the last calculated squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, respectively. The i variable is still equal to 3, indicating that the last iteration of the inner for loop has finished. The stdin contains 0 test cases, indicating that all input test cases have been processed. Finally, the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed t times.
