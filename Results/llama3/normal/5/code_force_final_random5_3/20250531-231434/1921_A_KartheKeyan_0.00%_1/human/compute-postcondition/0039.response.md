Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 4 and `n` is currently greater than -1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four pairs of coordinates (x, y), `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, `i` is 3, and stdin contains t-13 test cases, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, resulting in a new value that is 1 less than its original value minus 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-13 test cases.
