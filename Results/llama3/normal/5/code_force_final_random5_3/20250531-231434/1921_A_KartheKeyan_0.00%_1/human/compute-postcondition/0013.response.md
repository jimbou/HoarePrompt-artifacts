Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than -1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of n has been decremented by 1, so it is now equal to its original value minus 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on n, stdin, coord, res, p1, p2, and i are still valid.
