Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is a list containing three pairs of coordinates (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 2, the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed, and stdin contains t-12 test cases, and res is printed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to x and y. The second line appends a tuple containing x and y to the coord list. 

The initial state indicates that n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is a list containing two pairs of coordinates (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 2, the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed, and stdin contains t-11 test cases, and res is printed.

After the code executes, the coord list will contain three pairs of coordinates (x, y), and stdin will contain t-12 test cases. All other variables remain unchanged.
