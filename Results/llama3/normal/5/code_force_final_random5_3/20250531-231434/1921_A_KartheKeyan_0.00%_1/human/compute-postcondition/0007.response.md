The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2.
State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, coord is a list containing two tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is 2**
