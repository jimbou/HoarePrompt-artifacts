Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is a list containing two pairs of coordinates (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 1, the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed, and stdin contains t-11 test cases, and res is printed.**

The code reads a pair of coordinates (x, y) from stdin and appends them to the list coord. This means that coord now contains two pairs of coordinates. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
