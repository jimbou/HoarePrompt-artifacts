Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is a list containing one pair of coordinates (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 0, the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed, and stdin contains t-10 test cases, and res is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The `coord` list now contains one pair of coordinates `(x, y)` which were read from the input. The values of `res`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` also remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has already been printed, and `res` is also printed. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1, from `t-9` to `t-10`.
