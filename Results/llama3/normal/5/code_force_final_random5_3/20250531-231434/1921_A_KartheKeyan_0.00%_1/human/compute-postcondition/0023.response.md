Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, coord is a sorted list containing the coordinates (x, y) and the newly added point, res is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed, and stdin contains t-9 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The `coord` list has been sorted, and its elements are now in ascending order. The `res` variable now holds the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points. The `p1` and `p2` variables have been updated to hold the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. Finally, the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed, and stdin still contains t-9 test cases.
