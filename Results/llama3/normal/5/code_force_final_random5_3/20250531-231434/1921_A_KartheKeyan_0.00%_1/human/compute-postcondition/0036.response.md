Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and n is currently greater than 0, coord is a sorted list containing four pairs of coordinates (x, y), res is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3, and stdin contains t-13 test cases.**

The code sorts the list of coordinates in ascending order, updates the values of p1 and p2 based on the new coordinates, and calculates the absolute value of the product of the square roots of p1 and p2, assigning it to res. The value of n remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of i also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, as the code does not modify it.
