Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is 3**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: the value of n remains unchanged, the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 4, the coord list now contains four pairs of coordinates, the result res is still 0, and the loop counter i has reached 3.
