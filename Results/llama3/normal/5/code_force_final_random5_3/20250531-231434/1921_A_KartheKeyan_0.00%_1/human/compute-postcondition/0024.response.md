The code prints the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, which is the value of `res`.
Output: **the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points (where the points are from the sorted list coord)**
