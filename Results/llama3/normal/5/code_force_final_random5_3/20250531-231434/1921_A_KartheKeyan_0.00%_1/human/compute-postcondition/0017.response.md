Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-6 test cases, coord is a list containing the coordinates (x, y), res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 0, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1, from `t-5` to `t-6`, as one test case is consumed by the `input()` function. The `coord` list, initially empty, now contains the coordinates `(x, y)` read from the input. The values of `res`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed, but this does not affect the state of any variables.
