The `print(res)` statement will print the calculated value of `res`, which is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points.

Since `res` is calculated using the `p1` and `p2` values, which are the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, respectively, we can describe `res` as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of these squared differences.

However, without knowing the exact values of the coordinates in the `coord` list, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. Nevertheless, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points in the coord list**
