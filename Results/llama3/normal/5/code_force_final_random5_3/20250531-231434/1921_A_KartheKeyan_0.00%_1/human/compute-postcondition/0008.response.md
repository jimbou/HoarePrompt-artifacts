Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, coord is a list containing three tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is 2**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. These values are then appended to the `coord` list as a tuple. Since `n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than 0, it remains unchanged. The value of `res` and `i` also remains unchanged. The only modification is to the `coord` list, which now contains three tuples of two integers. Stdin now contains t-4 test cases.
