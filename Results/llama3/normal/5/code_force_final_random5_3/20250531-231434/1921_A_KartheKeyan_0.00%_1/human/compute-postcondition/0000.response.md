Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

Explanation: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The while loop runs as long as `n` is not zero. Inside the loop, the first line assigns the integer value of the input to `l`. The second line initializes `s` to 0. The third line calculates the value of `s` based on `l`. The fourth line prints the value of `s`. The fifth line decrements `n` by 1. Since the loop runs `n` times, the value of `n` is reduced by 1 after the loop finishes. The stdin contains `t-1` test cases after the execution of the code.
