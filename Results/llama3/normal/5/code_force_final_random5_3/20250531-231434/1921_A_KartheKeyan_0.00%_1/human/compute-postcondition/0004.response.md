Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, coord is a list containing one tuple of two integers, res is 0, i is 0**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains two space-separated integers. These integers are assigned to the variables x and y, respectively. The tuple (x, y) is then appended to the coord list. Since stdin initially contained t-1 test cases, after reading one line, it now contains t-2 test cases. The values of n, res, and i remain unchanged.
