Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and n is greater than 0, stdin contains t-8 test cases, coord is a list containing the coordinates (x, y) and the newly added point, res is 0, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 2, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed.**

The code reads a new point (x, y) from stdin and appends it to the coord list. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The values of n, res, p1, p2, and i remain unchanged.
