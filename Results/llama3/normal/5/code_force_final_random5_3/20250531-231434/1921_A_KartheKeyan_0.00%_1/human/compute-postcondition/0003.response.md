According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range `4`. Since `4` is a constant, we can't adjust it. However, we can adjust the variable `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be equal to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and `n` currently must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
