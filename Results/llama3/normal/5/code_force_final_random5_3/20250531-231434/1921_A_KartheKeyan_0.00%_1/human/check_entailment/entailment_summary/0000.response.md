Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the number of test cases and the coordinates of the corners of the square for each test case. It then calculates the area of the square by finding the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points. This is a valid method for calculating the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners.

However, there is a more efficient way to calculate the area of the square. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the length of the side can be found by taking the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of two adjacent points. The area can then be calculated by squaring the length of the side.

Correctness: **True**
