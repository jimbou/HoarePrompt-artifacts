The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `n` currently must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-7` test cases, `coord` is a list containing the coordinates (x, y) and the newly added point, `res` is 0, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, `i` is 2, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed.**
