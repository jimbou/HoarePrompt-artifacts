Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `n` is currently greater than -1, `coord` is a sorted list containing the coordinates (x, y) and the newly added point, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, `p1` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, `p2` is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, `i` is 3, the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points has been printed, and stdin contains t-9 test cases, and res is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, resulting in a new value that is 1 less than its original value minus 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `coord`, `res`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and stdin are still valid.
