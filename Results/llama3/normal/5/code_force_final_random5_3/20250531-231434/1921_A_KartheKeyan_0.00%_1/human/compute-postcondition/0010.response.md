Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and n currently must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, coord is a sorted list containing four tuples of two integers, res is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, p1 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the second and first points, p2 is the squared difference between the coordinates of the fourth and third points, i is 3**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `stdin` also remains the same as no input is taken from it. The `coord` list is sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple. The `res` variable is updated to hold the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points. The `p1` and `p2` variables are assigned the squared differences between the coordinates of the second and first points and the coordinates of the fourth and third points, respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
