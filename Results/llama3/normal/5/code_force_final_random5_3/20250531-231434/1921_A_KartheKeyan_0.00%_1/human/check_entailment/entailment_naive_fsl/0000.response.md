Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y1), (x2, y2). The program assumes that the coordinates are in this order and calculates the distance between the first two points and the last two points. However, if the coordinates are in a different order, the program will calculate the distance between two points that are not adjacent, resulting in an incorrect area.

For example, if the input coordinates are (1, 2), (4, 2), (1, 5), (4, 5), the program will calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (4, 2) and between (1, 5) and (4, 5), resulting in an area of 0, which is incorrect. The correct area is 9.
