To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `sequence`, and the `default` value in the `max` function.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `max(sequence, default=0)` is greater than 0. If `sequence` is an empty list, the `default` value of 0 will be used, and the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `sequence` to ensure it has at least one element.

Additionally, since `i` is initialized to the maximum value in `sequence`, we can adjust its state to be equal to the maximum value in `sequence`.

The state of `size_overlap` is not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **The number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, size_overlap is (0, 0), i is equal to the maximum value in sequence**
