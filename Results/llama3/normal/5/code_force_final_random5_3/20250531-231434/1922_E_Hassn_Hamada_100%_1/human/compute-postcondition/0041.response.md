Output State: **The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: size_overlap is equal to the original size, i is equal to the original i decremented by the number of iterations, size is equal to i + n, and value is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)). The number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the size_overlap variable remains unchanged, the i variable is decremented by the number of iterations, the size variable is equal to i plus the number of iterations, and the value variable is equal to 2 to the power of i plus the number of iterations minus 2 to the power of i minus 1. The number variable must be greater than or equal to 2 to the power of size_overlap plus 1 minus 2 to the power of i minus 1 and sufficient to satisfy 2 to the power of i plus the number of iterations minus 2 to the power of i minus 1 is less than or equal to the number.
