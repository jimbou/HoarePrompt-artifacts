Output State: **sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, number is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (max(sequence) + k)) - (1 << max(sequence))`, size_overlap is (max(sequence) + k, max(sequence)), i is equal to the maximum value in sequence, size is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus k, value is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus k minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `size` to the first element of the `size_overlap` tuple and the value of `i` to the second element of the `size_overlap` tuple. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The values of `sequence`, `number`, `i`, `size`, and `value` remain unchanged.
