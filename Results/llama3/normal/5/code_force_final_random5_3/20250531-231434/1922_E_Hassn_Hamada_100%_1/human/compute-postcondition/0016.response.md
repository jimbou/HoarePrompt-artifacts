Postcondition: ***The number is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (max(sequence) + k)) - (1 << max(sequence))`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If the value is less than or equal to the number, then `size_overlap` is (max(sequence) + k, max(sequence)), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus k, and `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus k minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence. Otherwise, no changes are made to `size_overlap`, `i`, `size`, and `value`.***
