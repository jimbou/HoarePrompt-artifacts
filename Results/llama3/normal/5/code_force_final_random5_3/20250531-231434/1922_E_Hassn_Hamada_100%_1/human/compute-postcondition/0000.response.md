Output State: **The number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers, and no changes have been made to the variables as the given code snippet is a docstring and does not contain any executable code.**

In this case, the code snippet is a docstring, which is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a function, class, or module definition. It is used to document the code and does not have any effect on the execution of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.
