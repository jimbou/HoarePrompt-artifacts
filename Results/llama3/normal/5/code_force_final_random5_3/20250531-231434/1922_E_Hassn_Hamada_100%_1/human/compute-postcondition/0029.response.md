To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):`

From the given state, we know that:
- `size` is increased by the number of iterations
- `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`
- `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)`
- If the current `value` is less than or equal to the current `number`, `size_overlap` is equal to the original `size`, and `i` is equal to the original `i`

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `sequence`.

Since `i` is the loop variable, it will be decremented by 1 in the next iteration (due to the `-1` step in the `range` function).

The `sequence` variable is not directly modified in the loop head, but its maximum value is used as the starting point for the `range`. However, since we are given that `i` is equal to the original `i` when the current `value` is less than or equal to the current `number`, we can assume that the `sequence` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`size` is increased by the number of iterations, `value` is `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1))`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1))`, `size_overlap` is equal to the original `size`, and `i` is equal to the original `i` decremented by 1**

Note that we decremented `i` by 1, as it will be the next value in the `range` function.
