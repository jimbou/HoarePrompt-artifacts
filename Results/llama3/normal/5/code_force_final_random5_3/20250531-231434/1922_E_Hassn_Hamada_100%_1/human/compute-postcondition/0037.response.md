Output State: **size is equal to i + n, value is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, size_overlap is equal to the original size, and i is equal to the original i decremented by 1, where n is the number of iterations of the loop.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `size` will be equal to the original value of `i` plus the number of iterations `n`. The value of `value` will be equal to the difference between the left shift of 1 by `i + n` bits and the left shift of 1 by `i - 1` bits. The value of `number` will be greater than or equal to the difference between the left shift of 1 by `size_overlap + 1` bits and the left shift of 1 by `i - 1` bits, and sufficient to satisfy the condition `(1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number`. The value of `size_overlap` will remain equal to the original value of `size`, and the value of `i` will be equal to the original value of `i` decremented by 1.
