Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers, and size_overlap is a tuple of two zeros (0, 0).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
    size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
    while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
        size += 1
        value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
    if value <= number:
        size_overlap = size, i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The number is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (max(sequence) + k)) - (1 << max(sequence))`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If the value is less than or equal to the number, then `size_overlap` is (max(sequence) + k, max(sequence)), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus k, and `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus k minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence. Otherwise, no changes are made to `size_overlap`, `i`, `size`, and `value`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *size is increased by the number of iterations, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), and number must be greater than or equal to (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i). If the current value of value is less than or equal to the current value of number, size_overlap is equal to the original value of size, and i is equal to the original value of i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *size is equal to i + n, value is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, size_overlap is equal to the original size, and i is equal to the original i decremented by 1. If value is less than or equal to number, then size_overlap is equal to i + n. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
