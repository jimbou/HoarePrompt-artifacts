Output State: **size is increased by 1, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)**

The first line increments the value of `size` by 1. The second line assigns a new value to `value` based on the updated value of `size` and the existing value of `i`. The expression `(1 << size)` calculates 2 to the power of the new `size` value, and `(1 << i)` calculates 2 to the power of `i`. The difference between these two values is assigned to `value`.
