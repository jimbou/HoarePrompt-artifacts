To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`. Given the states at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the states of `size`, `i`, and `number` to satisfy this condition.

1. `size` is equal to `i + 3`: This relationship between `size` and `i` should be maintained to ensure the condition is met.
2. `i` is equal to the original `i`: This means `i` has not changed, so we don't need to adjust it.
3. `number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << i)` and sufficient to satisfy `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) <= number`: These conditions imply that `number` is already sufficient to satisfy the loop condition for the current values of `size` and `i`. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` must still be true. Given that `size` is equal to `i + 3`, we can substitute `size` with `i + 3` in the condition:

`(1 << (i + 3) + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`

Simplifying the condition:

`(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i) <= number`

Since `i` is equal to the original `i`, we can conclude that the relationship between `size` and `i` will still hold in the next iteration. Therefore, we don't need to adjust `size` or `i`.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `number` to be greater than or equal to the new value of `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`. This means `number` must be greater than or equal to the next value in the sequence.

State: **`size` is equal to `i + 3`, `value` is equal to `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`, `number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, and `i` is equal to the original `i`**
