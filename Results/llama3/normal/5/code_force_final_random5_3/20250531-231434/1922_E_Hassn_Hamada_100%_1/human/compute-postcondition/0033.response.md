To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `size`, `i`, and `number`.

According to the code, the loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`. To make this condition true again, we need to adjust the values of `size`, `i`, and `number`.

Since `size` is equal to `i + 2`, we can't adjust `size` independently. We need to adjust `i` and `number` to make the condition true.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the original `i` decremented by 1. To make the condition true again, we need to increment `i` by 1, so that `i` is equal to the original `i`.

The value of `number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1))` and sufficient to satisfy `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number`. To make the condition true again, we need to adjust `number` to be greater than or equal to `(1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i))`.

State: **`size` is equal to `i + 2`, `value` is equal to `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << (i - 1))`, `number` is greater than or equal to `(1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i))` and sufficient to satisfy `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << (i)) <= number`, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, and `i` is equal to the original `i`**
