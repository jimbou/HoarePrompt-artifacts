Output State: **`size` is equal to `i + 1`, `value` is equal to `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1))`, `size_overlap` is equal to the original `size`, and `i` is equal to the original `i` decremented by 1**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been updated to be equal to `i + 1`, and the value of `value` has been updated to be equal to `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`. The other variables, `number`, `size_overlap`, and `i`, retain their original values and relationships.
