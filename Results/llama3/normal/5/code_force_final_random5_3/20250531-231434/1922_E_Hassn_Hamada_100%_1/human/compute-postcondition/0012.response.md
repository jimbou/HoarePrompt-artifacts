Output State: **The number is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (max(sequence) + 5)) - (1 << max(sequence))`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 5, `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 5 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.**

The code first increments the value of `size` by 1, making it equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 5. Then, it updates the value of `value` by calculating 2 to the power of the new `size` minus 2 to the power of `i`, which is the maximum value in sequence. The other variables remain unchanged.
