To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from the maximum value in the `sequence` list down to -1, decrementing by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is equal to the maximum value in `sequence`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`. The new value of `i` should be the current maximum value in `sequence` minus 1.

The other variables, such as `number`, `sequence`, `size_overlap`, `size`, and `value`, are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **The number is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (max(sequence) + k)) - (1 << max(sequence))`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence minus 1, `size_overlap` is (max(sequence) + k, max(sequence)), `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus k, and `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus k minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.**
