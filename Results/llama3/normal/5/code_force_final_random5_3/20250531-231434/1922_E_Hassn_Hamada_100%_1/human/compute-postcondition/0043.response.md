To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `size`, and `overlap`. The loop condition is `i in range(size - overlap)`, which means the loop will execute if `size - overlap` is greater than 0.

State: **`size` is greater than `overlap`, `overlap` is less than `size`, `i` is 0, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, `value` is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), and the number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number**
