Output State: **`size` is equal to the original size, `overlap` is equal to the original size, `i` is equal to the original i decremented by the number of iterations, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, `value` is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), and the number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number.**

In this output state, the values of `size` and `overlap` have been updated to be equal to the original size, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between the number and the other variables is still valid, ensuring that the number is greater than or equal to the specified lower bound and less than or equal to the specified upper bound.
