Output State: **size is increased by the number of iterations, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), and number must be greater than or equal to (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the size is increased by the number of iterations, the value is updated to be (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), and the number must be greater than or equal to (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i). This means that the loop will continue to execute until the number is no longer greater than or equal to the calculated value, at which point the loop will terminate.
