Output State: **size is equal to i + 2, value is equal to (1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << (i - 1)), number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, size_overlap is equal to the original size, and i is equal to the original i decremented by 1**

In this final state, the value of `size` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to `i + 2`. The value of `value` has been updated to `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << (i - 1))`, which is the new value based on the updated `size` and original `i`. The constraints on `number` remain the same, as they are not affected by the code. The values of `size_overlap` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
