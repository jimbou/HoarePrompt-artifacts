Output State: **`size` is greater than `overlap`, `overlap` is less than `size`, `i` is 0, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, `value` is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), the number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, and `sequence` now contains the value `overlap`.**

In this output state, the values of `size`, `overlap`, `i`, `size_overlap`, and `value` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The only change is that the `sequence` list now contains the value `overlap`, which was appended to it by the code. The conditions regarding the number and its relationship to the other variables also remain valid, as they were not affected by the code.
