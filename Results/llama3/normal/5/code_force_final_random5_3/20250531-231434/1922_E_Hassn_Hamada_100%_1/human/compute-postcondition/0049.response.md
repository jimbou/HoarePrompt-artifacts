Output State: `size` is greater than `overlap`, `overlap` is less than `size`, `i` is equal to `size - overlap`, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, `value` is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), the number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, and `sequence` now contains the values `overlap`, `overlap + 1`, ..., `size - 1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that the `size` is still greater than `overlap`, and `overlap` is still less than `size`. The loop counter `i` has reached its final value, which is `size - overlap`. The `size_overlap` variable remains unchanged, equal to the original size. The `value` variable still satisfies the conditions related to the number and the bit shifts. Finally, the `sequence` list now contains all the values from `overlap` to `size - 1`, inclusive.
