Output State: **size is equal to i + 4, value is equal to (1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i), number is greater than or equal to (1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i), size_overlap is equal to the original size, and i is equal to the original i**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to `i + 4`. The value of `value` has been updated to `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`, which is a new calculation based on the updated `size`. The value of `number` remains greater than or equal to `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `size_overlap` remains the same as the original size, as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as the original `i`, as it was not modified by the code.
