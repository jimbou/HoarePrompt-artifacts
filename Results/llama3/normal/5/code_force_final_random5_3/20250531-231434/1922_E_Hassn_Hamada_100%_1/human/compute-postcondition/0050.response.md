Output State: **`size` is greater than or equal to `overlap`, `overlap` is less than or equal to `size`, `i` is equal to `size - overlap`, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, `value` is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), the number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, and `sequence` now contains the values `overlap`, `overlap + 1`, ..., `size - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over the range from `overlap` to `size - 1`, and the `sequence` list now contains all the values in this range. The other variables, `size_overlap` and `value`, remain unchanged, and the conditions on `size`, `overlap`, and the number are still satisfied.
