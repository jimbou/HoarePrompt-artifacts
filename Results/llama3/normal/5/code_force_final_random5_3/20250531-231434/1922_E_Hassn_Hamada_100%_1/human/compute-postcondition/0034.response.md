Output State: **size is equal to i + 3, value is equal to (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i), number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << i) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) <= number, size_overlap is equal to the original size, and i is equal to the original i**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to `i + 3`. The value of `value` has been recalculated based on the new value of `size`, resulting in `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`. The values of `number`, `size_overlap`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code.
