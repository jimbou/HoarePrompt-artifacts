Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, size_overlap is (0, 0), i is equal to the maximum value in sequence, size is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 1, value is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 1 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.
Code of the loop:
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
    size += 1
    value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The number is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large to satisfy the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 2, `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 2 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The number is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large to satisfy the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 4, `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 4 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The number is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (max(sequence) + 5)) - (1 << max(sequence))`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 5, `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 5 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
