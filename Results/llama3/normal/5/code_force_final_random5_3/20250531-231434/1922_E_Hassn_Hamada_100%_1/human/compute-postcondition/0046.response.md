Output State: **`size` is greater than `overlap`, `overlap` is less than `size`, `i` is 1, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, `value` is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), the number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, and `sequence` now contains the values `overlap` and `i + overlap`.**

In this output state, the value of `sequence` has been updated to include the new value `i + overlap`, in addition to the original value `overlap`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original relationships and values.
