Output State: **The number is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (max(sequence) + k)) - (1 << max(sequence))`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus k, `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus k minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the number is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (max(sequence) + k)) - (1 << max(sequence))`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus k, `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus k minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.
