Output State: **size is increased by 3, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), and number must be greater than or equal to (1 << (size + 1) + 1) - (1 << i)**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been increased by 1 from its initial state, which was already increased by 2. The value of `value` has been updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, which is a new calculation based on the updated `size`. The condition on `number` remains the same, but its lower bound has changed due to the increase in `size`.
