Output State: **The number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, size_overlap is (0, 0), i is equal to the maximum value in sequence, size is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 1, value is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 1 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.**

In natural language, the output state is that the number remains a positive integer, the sequence remains a list of integers with at least one element, and the size_overlap remains (0, 0). The variable i remains equal to the maximum value in the sequence. Two new variables are introduced: size, which is equal to the maximum value in the sequence plus 1, and value, which is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in the sequence plus 1 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in the sequence.
