Output State: **`size` is greater than `overlap` + 2, `overlap` is less than `size`, `i` is 2, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, `value` is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), the number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, and `sequence` now contains the values `overlap`, `i + overlap`, and `i + overlap`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The size is still greater than the overlap plus 2, and the overlap is still less than the size. The value of i remains 2. The size_overlap is still equal to the original size. The value is still equal to the expression (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)). The number is still greater than or equal to the expression (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and is sufficient to satisfy the condition (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number. The sequence now contains three values: the overlap, i plus the overlap (which was already present), and again i plus the overlap (which was just appended).
