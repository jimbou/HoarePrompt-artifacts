To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `size`, `i`, and `number`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 2, and `number` is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large to satisfy the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `size` and `i` so that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`. 

Since `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 2, and `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, we can increase `size` by 1 and keep `i` the same. This will ensure that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`.

State: **The number is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large to satisfy the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 3, `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 3 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.**
