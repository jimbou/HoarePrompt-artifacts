Postcondition: ***size is increased by the number of iterations, value is (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i), and number must be greater than or equal to (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i). If the current value of value is less than or equal to the current value of number, size_overlap is equal to the original value of size, and i is equal to the original value of i.***
