Output State: **The number is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(1 << (max(sequence) + k)) - (1 << max(sequence))`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence minus 1, `size_overlap` is (max(sequence) + k, max(sequence)), `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, and `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number is still a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to a certain value based on the maximum value in the sequence and k. The sequence is still a list of integers with at least one element. The variable i is still equal to the maximum value in the sequence minus 1. The size_overlap is still a tuple containing the maximum value in the sequence plus k and the maximum value in the sequence. However, the variable size is now equal to the maximum value in the sequence, and the variable value is now equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in the sequence minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in the sequence minus 1.
