Output State: **`size` is greater than or equal to `overlap`, `overlap` is less than or equal to `size`, `i` is equal to `size - overlap`, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, `value` is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), the number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, and `sequence` now contains the values `overlap`, `overlap + 1`, ..., `size - 1`, and a value has been returned from `func_1` with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that a value has been returned from the function `func_1` with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`. The values of the variables `size`, `overlap`, `i`, `size_overlap`, `value`, and `sequence` remain the same as in the initial state.
