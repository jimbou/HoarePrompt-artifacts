To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` and adjust the states of variables involved in this condition, which are `size`, `i`, and `number`.

Given the initial states:

- The number is a positive integer.
- Sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `size_overlap` is (0, 0), which is not relevant to the loop condition.
- `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence.
- `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 1.
- `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 1 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence, which is also not relevant to the loop condition.

The loop condition can be simplified by understanding that `(1 << size + 1)` is equivalent to `2 * (1 << size)` and `(1 << i)` is equivalent to `2` raised to the power of `i`. Given that `size` is `i + 1`, the condition can be seen as comparing the difference between two powers of 2 to `number`.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`. Since `size` is `i + 1`, and given the initial values, the expression simplifies to a comparison that depends on the values of `i` and `number`.

However, without specific numerical values for `i` and `number`, we can only ensure the loop can execute by making sure that `number` is sufficiently large to accommodate the difference calculated by the expression for any given `i` and `size`. Given that `i` is the maximum value in sequence and `size` is `i + 1`, the condition is always dependent on the relationship between `number` and the calculated expression.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `number` is greater than or equal to the difference that would be calculated by the expression for the given `i` and `size`. However, since `i` and `size` are determined by the sequence's maximum value, and without knowing the exact value of the sequence's maximum element, we can only state that `number` must be sufficiently large.

Given the provided information and the nature of the condition, we cannot specify an exact numerical adjustment for `number` without knowing the maximum value in sequence. However, we can state the requirement for `number` in relation to the expression.

State: **The number is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large to satisfy the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 1, `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 1 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.**
