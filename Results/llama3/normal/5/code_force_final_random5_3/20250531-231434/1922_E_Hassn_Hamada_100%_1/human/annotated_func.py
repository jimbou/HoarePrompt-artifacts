#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and recursively appends values to the sequence until the input number is reduced to 0, returning two values: 0 and 0. The function accepts a positive integer and a list of integers as input, and modifies the list by appending values to it. The final state of the program is that the input list contains a sequence of numbers generated based on the input number, and the input number is reduced to 0.
