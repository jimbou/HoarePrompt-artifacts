Postcondition: ***size is equal to i + n, value is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, size_overlap is equal to the original size, and i is equal to the original i decremented by 1. If value is less than or equal to number, then size_overlap is equal to i + n. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
