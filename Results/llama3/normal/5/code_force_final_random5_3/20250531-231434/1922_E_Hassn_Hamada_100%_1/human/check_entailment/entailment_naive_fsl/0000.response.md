Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 3, the program outputs [0, 1, 0], which has 4 increasing subsequences ([], [0], [1], [0, 1]), not 3. This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the input number is a power of 2 minus 1.

The program's logic is based on finding a sequence of numbers that can be obtained by removing some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing. However, the program's implementation does not correctly achieve this goal.

The function `func_1` is recursive and tries to find a sequence of numbers that satisfies the condition. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the input number is a power of 2 minus 1. In this case, the program outputs a sequence that has more than the required number of increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
