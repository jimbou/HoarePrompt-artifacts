To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(size - overlap):`. The objects involved are `i`, `size`, and `overlap`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The condition for the loop to execute again is `i < size - overlap`. Since `i` is now 2, `size - overlap` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other states, such as `size_overlap`, `value`, `number`, and `sequence`, are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`size` is greater than `overlap` + 2, `overlap` is less than `size`, `i` is 2, `size_overlap` is equal to the original size, `value` is equal to (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)), the number is greater than or equal to (1 << (size_overlap + 1)) - (1 << (i - 1)) and sufficient to satisfy (1 << (i + n)) - (1 << (i - 1)) <= number, and `sequence` now contains the values `overlap` and `i + overlap`.**
