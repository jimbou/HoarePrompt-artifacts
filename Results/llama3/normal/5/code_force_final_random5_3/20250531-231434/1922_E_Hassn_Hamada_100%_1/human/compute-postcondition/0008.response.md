Output State: **The number is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large to satisfy the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`, sequence is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is equal to the maximum value in sequence, `size` is equal to the maximum value in sequence plus 2, `value` is equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence plus 2 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in sequence.**

In this output state, the number remains a positive integer and must still satisfy the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`. The sequence remains unchanged as a list of integers with at least one element. The `size_overlap` variable remains unchanged at (0, 0). The `i` variable remains equal to the maximum value in the sequence. The `size` variable is incremented by 1, making it equal to the maximum value in the sequence plus 2. The `value` variable is updated to be equal to 2 to the power of the maximum value in the sequence plus 2 minus 2 to the power of the maximum value in the sequence.
