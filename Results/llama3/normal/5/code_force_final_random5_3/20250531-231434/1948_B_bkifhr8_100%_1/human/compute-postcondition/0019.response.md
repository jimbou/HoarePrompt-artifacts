Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), i is m - 3, nums is a list of digits of arr[i - 1] plus arr[i], ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `ans` is now `False`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`) retain their original values and properties as described in the initial state.
