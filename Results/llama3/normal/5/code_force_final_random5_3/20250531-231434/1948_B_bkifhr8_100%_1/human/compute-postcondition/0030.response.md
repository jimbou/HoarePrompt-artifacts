Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is specifically calculated based on the values of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`. The digits of `arr[i - 1]` are converted to integers and added to the list, followed by the value of `arr[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
