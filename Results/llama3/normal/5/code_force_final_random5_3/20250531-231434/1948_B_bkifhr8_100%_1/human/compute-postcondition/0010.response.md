Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If the value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`, then the value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` is set to False if the digits of the updated `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` are not in ascending order. Otherwise, `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
