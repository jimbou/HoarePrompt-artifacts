Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, i is m - 2, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[m - 3] and the last element is arr[m - 2], ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program's flow in this context.

Given the initial state, all variables retain their original values except for `ans`, which is now explicitly set to `False`. The state of `n`, `m`, `arr`, the printed output ('YES' or 'NO'), `i`, and `nums` remains unchanged as none of these variables are modified by the provided code snippet.
