Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the sum of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]`. If the digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]` are not in sorted order, then `ans` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of the sum of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains `n` integers between 0 and 99, and `i` is still equal to `m - 3`. The list `nums` still contains the digits of the sum of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`. The value of `ans` is still False if the digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]` are not in sorted order.
