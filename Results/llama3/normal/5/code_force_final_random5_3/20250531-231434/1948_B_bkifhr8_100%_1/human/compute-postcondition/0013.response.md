Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), i is m - 2, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i], ans is False**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

Therefore, the only change to the initial state is the assignment of `False` to the variable `ans`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums`) remain unchanged.
