Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` which is also the first integer in `nums` and is equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be equal to the first digit of `arr[i - 1]`, which is also the first integer in `nums`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains `m` integers between 0 and 99, where the first element is the first digit of the last element. Either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and the value of `i` is still `m - 2`. The list `nums` still contains two integers, where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`. The value of `ans` depends on whether `nums` is sorted or not.
