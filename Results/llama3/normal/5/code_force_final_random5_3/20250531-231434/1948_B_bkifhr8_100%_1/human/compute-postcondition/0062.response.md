Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` which is also the first integer in `nums`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` has been updated to be a list of two integers, where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`. The value of `arr[i - 1]` has also been updated to be equal to the first digit of `arr[i - 1]`, which is also the first integer in `nums`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
