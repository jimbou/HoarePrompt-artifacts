Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a list that contains the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in the list `arr`, plus the integer at index `i` in the list `arr`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
