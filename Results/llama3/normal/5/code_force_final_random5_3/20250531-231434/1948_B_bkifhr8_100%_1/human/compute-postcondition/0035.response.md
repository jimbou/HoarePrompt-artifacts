Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr` is a list where the second last element is the first digit of the previous second last element, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
