To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 2 (since the range starts from `m - 1` and goes down to `1`). 

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 1`**
