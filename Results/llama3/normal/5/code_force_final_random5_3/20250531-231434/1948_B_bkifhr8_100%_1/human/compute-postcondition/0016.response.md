Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to its first digit, and a new list `nums` is created with the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then no changes are made to the variables.***
