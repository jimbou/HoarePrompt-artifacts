Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero).

The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning. If it encounters a pair of elements where the current element is less than the previous one, it checks if the previous element can be split into digits and inserted in the correct order to maintain the sorted order. If this is not possible, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop.

The program then prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the array is already sorted or where the operation is not needed.

Correctness: **True**
