Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where the value of `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains `n` integers between 0 and 99, and the relationship between `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is still maintained. The input stream `stdin` still contains `t-2` test cases, and the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `nums` are unchanged. The value of `ans` depends on whether `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not.
