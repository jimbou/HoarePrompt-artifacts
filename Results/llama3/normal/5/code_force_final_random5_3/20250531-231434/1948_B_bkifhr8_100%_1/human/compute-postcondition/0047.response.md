Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[i-1]` is the first digit of `arr[m-4]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m-4]` and the last element is `arr[m-3]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
