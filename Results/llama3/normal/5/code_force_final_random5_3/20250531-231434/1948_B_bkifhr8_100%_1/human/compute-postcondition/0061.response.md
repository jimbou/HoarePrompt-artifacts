To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 2`, `ans` is True, `nums` is undefined, `stdin` is empty. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` is a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` which is also the first integer in `nums`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
