Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged in non-decreasing order by only swapping adjacent elements and replacing the first digit of the first element with the first digit of the last element. The program iterates through the list from the end to the beginning, and for each pair of adjacent elements that are in the wrong order, it checks if the digits of the first element can be rearranged to be in non-decreasing order with the second element. If this is not possible for any pair of elements, the program prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the case where the list is already sorted.

Correctness: **True**
