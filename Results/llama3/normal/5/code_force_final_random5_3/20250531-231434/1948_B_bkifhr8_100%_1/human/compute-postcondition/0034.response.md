Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where the second last element is the first digit of the previous second last element, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of the previous second last element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `arr[i - 1]` is now a single digit integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive), since it is the first digit of the previous second last element of `arr`.
