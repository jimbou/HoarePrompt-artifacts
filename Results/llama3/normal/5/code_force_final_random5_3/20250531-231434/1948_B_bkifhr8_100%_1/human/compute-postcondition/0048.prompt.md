Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr` is a list where the second last element is the first digit of the previous second last element, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[m - 3]` is less than `arr[m - 2]`, then `arr[m - 3]` is replaced by the first element of `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original value of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[i-1]` is the first digit of `arr[m-4]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m-4]` and the last element is `arr[m-3]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
