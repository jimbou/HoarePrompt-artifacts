Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is True if all pairs of adjacent elements in `arr` are in ascending order, otherwise `ans` is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` will have its elements updated according to the rules specified in the loop, and the variable `ans` will be set to True if all pairs of adjacent elements in `arr` are in ascending order, otherwise it will be set to False. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
