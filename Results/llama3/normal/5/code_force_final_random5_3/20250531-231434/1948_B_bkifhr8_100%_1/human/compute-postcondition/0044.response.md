Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, i is m - 3, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[m-4] and the last element is arr[m-3], ans is False**.

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the output state.

The initial state remains mostly unchanged, with the addition of `ans` being set to `False`. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums` remain the same as they were before the code execution. The state of whether 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed also remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not affect this condition.
