To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive)
- `i` is `m - 2`

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is `m - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 (due to the `-1` step in the `range` function), thus `i` becomes `m - 3`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their states do not change based on the loop head alone. However, since `i` changes, we need to consider how this change affects the conditions within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we focus only on the loop head's influence.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is `m - 3`**
