The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `m - 3`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` is a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` which is also the first integer in `nums` and is equal to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` is undefined and `ans` remains True.**
