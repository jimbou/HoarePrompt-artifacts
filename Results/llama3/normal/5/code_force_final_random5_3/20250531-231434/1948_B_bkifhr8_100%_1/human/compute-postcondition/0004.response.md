Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), `i` is `m - 1`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**
