Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]`. If the digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]` are not in sorted order, then `ans` is False.**
