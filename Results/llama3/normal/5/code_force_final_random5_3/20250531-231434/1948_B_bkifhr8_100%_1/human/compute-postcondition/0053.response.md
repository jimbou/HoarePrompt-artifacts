To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1, which is already given in the initial state. However, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be within the range of the loop.

Since the loop iterates from `m - 1` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order, we can set `i` to be `m - 1` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, `nums` is undefined, `stdin` is empty**
