Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If the value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`, then the value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` is set to False if the digits of the updated `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` are not in ascending order. Otherwise, `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to its first digit, and a new list `nums` is created with the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the sum of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]`. If the digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]` are not in sorted order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` and `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
