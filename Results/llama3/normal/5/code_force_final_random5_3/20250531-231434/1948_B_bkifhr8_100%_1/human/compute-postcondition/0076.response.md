Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is 1, `ans` is True or False, `nums` is undefined, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of `ans`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and for each test case, it has checked if the list of integers is in ascending order. If the list is in ascending order, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The loop has also updated the value of `arr[0]` to be the first digit of `arr[m-1]` for each test case. The value of `i` is 1, indicating that the loop has finished processing all the test cases. The value of `ans` is either True or False, depending on whether the list of integers is in ascending order. The variable `nums` is undefined, and the input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all the test cases have been processed.
