Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m-4]` and the last element is `arr[m-3]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a combination of the digits of `arr[m-4]` and `arr[m-3]`. The digits of `arr[m-4]` are converted to integers and added to the list, followed by `arr[m-3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
