Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is 1, `ans` is True or False, `nums` is undefined, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches 1. At each iteration, if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` will be a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, `ans` will be set to False. Otherwise, `ans` will remain True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` will be undefined and `ans` will remain True.

After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be 1, and `ans` will be either True or False depending on whether any of the `nums` lists were not sorted in ascending order. The other variables, `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `stdin`, will remain unchanged.
