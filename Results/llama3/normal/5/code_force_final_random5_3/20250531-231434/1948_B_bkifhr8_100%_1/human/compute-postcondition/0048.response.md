Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is 1. If `arr[1]` is less than `arr[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m-1]` and the last element is `arr[m-2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, `m` is still greater than 1, and `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). The value of `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`. Either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed. The value of `i` is 1. If `arr[1]` is less than `arr[0]`, then `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m-1]` and the last element is `arr[m-2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.
