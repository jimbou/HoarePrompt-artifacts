Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where arr[0] is the first digit of arr[m-1], either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, i is 1, ans is True, nums is undefined, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `m`. Since `m` is an integer greater than 1, this line does not change the fact that `m` is an integer greater than 1. The second line assigns a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) to `arr`, where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`. This line does not change the fact that `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`. The third line assigns `True` to `ans`. Since `ans` is either `True` or `False`, this line sets `ans` to `True`. No other variables are affected.
