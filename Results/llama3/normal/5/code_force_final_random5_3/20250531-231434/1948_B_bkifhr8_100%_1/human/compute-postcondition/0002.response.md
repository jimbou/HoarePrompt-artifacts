Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99)**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `m`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` also becomes an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The second line reads `m` integers from stdin and assigns them to `arr`. Since each integer is between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `arr` becomes a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). The third line assigns `True` to `ans`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, leaving `t-2` test cases.
