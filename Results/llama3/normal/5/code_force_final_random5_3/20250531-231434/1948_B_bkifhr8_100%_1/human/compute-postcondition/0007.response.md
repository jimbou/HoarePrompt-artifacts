Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is False, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), i is m - 1, nums is a list of digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i], the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], and nums is not sorted in ascending order.**

The code snippet sets `ans` to `False` and then breaks out of the loop. The `break` statement does not affect any variables, but it does terminate the loop. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
