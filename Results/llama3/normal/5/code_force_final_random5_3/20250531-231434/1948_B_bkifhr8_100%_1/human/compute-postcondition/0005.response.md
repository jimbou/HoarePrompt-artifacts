Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the code has created a new list `nums` that contains the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in the `arr` list, followed by the integer at index `i` in the `arr` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]` is still valid.
