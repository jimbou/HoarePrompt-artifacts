Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a combination of the digits of `arr[m - 3]` and the value of `arr[m - 2]`. The digits of `arr[m - 3]` are obtained by converting it to a string and then to a list of integers. The value of `arr[m - 2]` is appended to this list. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
