Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed**.

The code block first reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `m`, overwriting its previous value. Then, it reads a list of `m` integers from the input, splits them into individual integers, and assigns this list to `arr`, replacing its previous value. The value of `ans` is set to `True`, but this does not depend on the previous state of `ans`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The code does not print anything based on the value of `ans`, so either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, but the exact output depends on the previous state of `ans`, which is not specified.
