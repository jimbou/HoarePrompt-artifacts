Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where arr[i-1] is the first digit of arr[m-4], either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, i is m - 3, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[m-4] and the last element is arr[m-3]. If nums is not sorted, ans is False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n remains the same, m also remains the same, arr is still a list of m integers between 0 and 99, but the value of arr[i-1] has been updated to be the first digit of arr[m-4]. The value of i remains the same, and the list nums also remains the same. The value of ans is still False if nums is not sorted, and no additional changes are made if nums is sorted. Either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed.
