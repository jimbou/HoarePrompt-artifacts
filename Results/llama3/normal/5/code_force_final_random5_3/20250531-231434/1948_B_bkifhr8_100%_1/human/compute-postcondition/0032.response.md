Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is False, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, i is m - 1, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was previously `True`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or the program's flow.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `ans`, which is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
