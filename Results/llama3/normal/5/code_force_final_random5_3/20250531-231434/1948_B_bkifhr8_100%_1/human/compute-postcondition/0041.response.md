Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[m - 3]` is less than `arr[m - 2]`, then `arr[m - 3]` is replaced by the first element of `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original value of `arr[m - 3]` and the last element is `arr[m - 2]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
