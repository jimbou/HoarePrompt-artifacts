Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` is a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` which is also the first integer in `nums` and is equal to `nums[0]`, and `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` is undefined and `ans` remains True.**
