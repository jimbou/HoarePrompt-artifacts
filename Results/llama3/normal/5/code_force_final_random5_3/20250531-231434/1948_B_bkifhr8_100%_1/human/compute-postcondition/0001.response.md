According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we only need to adjust the state of `_` to be 0, since it will be the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), `_` is 0**
