To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions that affect the value of `ans`.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive).
   - `m` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`.
   - Either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed.
   - `i` is 1.
   - If `arr[1]` is less than `arr[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[m-1]` and the last element is `arr[m-2]`.
   - If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.

2. **Print Statement**: `print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])`

Given the conditions, the value of `ans` is determined by whether `nums` is sorted or not. However, the initial state does not provide explicit values for `arr`, `m`, or `n`, nor does it specify whether `arr[1]` is less than `arr[0]`. Therefore, we cannot directly compute the value of `ans` or the output of the print statement.

However, we can describe the output based on the conditions provided:

- If `nums` is sorted (which happens if `arr[1]` is not less than `arr[0]` or if the constructed list `nums` from the digits of `arr[m-1]` and `arr[m-2]` is sorted), `ans` would be True, and the output would be 'YES'.
- If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False, and the output would be 'NO'.

Since we cannot determine the exact state of `nums` or the comparison between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` without explicit values, the output depends on these conditions.

Output: **'YES' if nums is sorted, 'NO' if nums is not sorted**
