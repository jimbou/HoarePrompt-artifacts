Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where arr[0] is the first digit of arr[m-1], either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, i is m - 1, ans is False, and nums is a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of arr[i - 1] and the second integer is arr[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was previously `True`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or the state.

Therefore, the only change in the state is the value of `ans`, which is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
