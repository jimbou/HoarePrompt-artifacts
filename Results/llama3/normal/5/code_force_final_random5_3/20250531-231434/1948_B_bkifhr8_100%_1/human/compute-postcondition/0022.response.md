Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the sum of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]`. If the digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]` are not in sorted order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` and `ans` remains unchanged.***
