Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[0]` is the first digit of `arr[m-1]`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`, and `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `nums` is newly defined as a list of two integers, where the first integer is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]` and the second integer is `arr[i]`. The condition that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` is still valid.
