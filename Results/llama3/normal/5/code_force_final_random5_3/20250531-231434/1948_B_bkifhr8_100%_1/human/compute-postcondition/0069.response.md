Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where arr[0] is the first digit of arr[m-1], either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, i is m - 3, nums is a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of arr[i - 1] and the second integer is arr[i], arr[i - 1] is now equal to the first digit of arr[i - 1] which is also the first integer in nums and is equal to nums[0], ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `ans` to `False`, regardless of its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the output state. 

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `ans` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
