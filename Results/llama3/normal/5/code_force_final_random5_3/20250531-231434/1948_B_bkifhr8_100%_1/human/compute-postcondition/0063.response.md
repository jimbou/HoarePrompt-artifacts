Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of m integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where arr[0] is the first digit of arr[m-1], either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, i is m - 2, ans is False, nums is a list of two integers where the first integer is the first digit of arr[i - 1] and the second integer is arr[i], arr[i - 1] is now equal to the first digit of arr[i - 1] which is also the first integer in nums.**

The code snippet sets the value of `ans` to False and then breaks out of the loop. The break statement does not affect any variables, so the only change is that `ans` is now False. All other variables remain unchanged.
