To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is `m - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1 (since the step size is -1). Therefore, `i` should be `m - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

The other variables in the loop head are `m` and the range object created by `range(m - 1, 0, -1)`. However, since `m` is not modified within the loop, its value remains the same.

The range object is created based on the value of `m`, and its bounds are determined by `m - 1` and `0`. Since `m` is an integer greater than 1, the range object will still be valid for the next iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`, which should be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `m` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, `i` is `m - 3`.**
