The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer equal to n // 2. This does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n is an integer greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-8 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2 times x plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 4, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4, n is an integer greater than 0**
