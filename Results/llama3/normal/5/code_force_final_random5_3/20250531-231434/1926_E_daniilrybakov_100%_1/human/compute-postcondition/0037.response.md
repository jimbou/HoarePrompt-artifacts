Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x, m is equal to four times its original value, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to n // 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, _, stdin, n, k, s, m, x, and n remain the same as in the initial state.
