The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 and stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
