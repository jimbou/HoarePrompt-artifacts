The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 2, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4**
