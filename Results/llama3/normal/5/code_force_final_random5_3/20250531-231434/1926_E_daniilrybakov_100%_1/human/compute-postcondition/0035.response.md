According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer greater than 0 divided by 2. This does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n is an integer greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x, m is equal to four times its original value, x is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus one divided by 2, n is an integer greater than 0**
