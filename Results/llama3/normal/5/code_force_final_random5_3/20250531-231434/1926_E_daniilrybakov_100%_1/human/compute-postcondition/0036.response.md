Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x, m is equal to four times its original value, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to n // 2.**

In this output state, the value of x has been updated to be equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of n has been updated to be equal to n // 2. The values of t, _, stdin, s, m, and k remain unchanged.
