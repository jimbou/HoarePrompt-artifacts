Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` becomes 0, and the value of `s` is updated to be equal to its original value plus the integer part of `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `m` is updated to be equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1. The value of `x` is updated to be equal to the integer part of `(n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `_`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
