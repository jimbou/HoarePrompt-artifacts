Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 4, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2x + (n+1)//2, m is equal to its original value times 4, x is an integer equal to (n+1)//4. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
