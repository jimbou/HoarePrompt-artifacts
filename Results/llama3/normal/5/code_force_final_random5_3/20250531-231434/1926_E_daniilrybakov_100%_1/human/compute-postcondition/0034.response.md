Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x, m is equal to four times its original value, x is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus one divided by 2, n is an integer greater than 0 divided by 2.**

The code modifies the values of `s` and `m`. The first line increments `s` by the value of `x`, which is half of the original value of `n` plus one divided by 2. The second line doubles the value of `m`, making it four times its original value. The rest of the variables and the state of stdin remain unchanged.
