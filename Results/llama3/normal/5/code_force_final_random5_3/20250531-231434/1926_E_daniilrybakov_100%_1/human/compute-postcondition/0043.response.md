The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus the sum of x values, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, n is an integer equal to n // 2, and this is printed: (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m**
