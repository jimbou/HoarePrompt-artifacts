The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 2. If s < k and k <= s + x, then n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 4. In either case, n is not zero, so it does not need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2x, m is equal to its original value times 4, x is an integer equal to (n+1)//2, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 2. If s < k and k <= s + x, then n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 4, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus (n+1)//2 + (n+1)//4, m is equal to its original value times 8, x is an integer equal to (n+1)//4**
