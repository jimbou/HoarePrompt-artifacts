The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer equal to its original value divided by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of n needed to have been greater than 0 and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x, m is equal to its original value times 2, x is an integer equal to the ceiling of n/2, n is an integer greater than 0**
