Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 4, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus (n+1)//2, m is equal to its original value times 4, x is an integer equal to (n+1)//4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state means that the value of `n` has been divided by 4, the value of `m` has been multiplied by 4, the value of `x` has been updated to `(n+1)//4`, and the value of `s` has been updated to its original value plus `(n+1)//2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
