Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x, m is equal to twice its original value, x is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus one divided by 2, n is an integer greater than 0 divided by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 2 and 5 * 10^4, the value of `_` is still 1, the stdin still contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is still an integer greater than 0, k is still an integer, s is still equal to its original value plus x, m is still equal to twice its original value, x is still an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus one divided by 2, n is still an integer greater than 0 divided by 2. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
