According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer. An integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is not zero.

State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is not zero, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1, and this is printed: (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m**
