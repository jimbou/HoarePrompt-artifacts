Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x, m is equal to twice its original value, x is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus one divided by 2, n is an integer greater than 0 divided by 2. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
