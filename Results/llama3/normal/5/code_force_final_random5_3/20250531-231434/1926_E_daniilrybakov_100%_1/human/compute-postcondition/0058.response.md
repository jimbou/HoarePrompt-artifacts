Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-9 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2 times x plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 4, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4, n is an integer greater than 0 and is half of its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, _, stdin, n, k, s, m, and x remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
