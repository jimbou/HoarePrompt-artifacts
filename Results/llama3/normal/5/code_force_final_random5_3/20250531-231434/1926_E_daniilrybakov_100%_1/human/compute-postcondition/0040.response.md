Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus the sum of x values, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, n is an integer equal to n // 2.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` becomes 0, the value of `s` becomes the sum of all `x` values, and the value of `m` becomes 2 to the power of the number of iterations. The values of `t`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The loop breaks when `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, or when `n` becomes 0.
