Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-9 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 3 times x plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 8, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4, n is an integer greater than 0 and is half of its original value. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has increased by `x` due to the first line of code, and the value of `m` has doubled due to the second line of code. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `s`, `k`, and `x` still apply, and the loop or if statement will break if the conditions are met.
