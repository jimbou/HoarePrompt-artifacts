Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the process of laying down cards as described in the problem description. It iteratively calculates the number of cards that are odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on, until it finds the range where the k-th card lies. It then calculates the exact value of the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, where `s` is the cumulative sum of cards laid down before the current range, and `m` is the multiplier for the current range (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as `k` being 1 or `n` being a power of 2. The use of integer division (`//`) and the calculation of `x` as `(n + 1) // 2` ensure that the program works correctly for all values of `n` and `k`.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
