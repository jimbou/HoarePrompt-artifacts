Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, and this is printed: (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m**
