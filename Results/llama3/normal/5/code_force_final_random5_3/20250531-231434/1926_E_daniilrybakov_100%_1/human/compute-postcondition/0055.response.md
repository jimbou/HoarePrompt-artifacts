Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-8 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2 times x plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 4, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4, n is an integer equal to n // 2. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by `x` twice, resulting in `s` being equal to its original value plus 2 times `x` plus `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `m` has been multiplied by 2, resulting in `m` being equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 4. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
