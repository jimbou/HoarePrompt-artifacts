Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2x, m is equal to its original value times 4, x is an integer equal to (n+1)//2, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 2. If s < k and k <= s + x, then n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 4, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus (n+1)//2 + (n+1)//4, m is equal to its original value times 8, x is an integer equal to (n+1)//4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `s` and `m` have been updated based on the initial state and the code snippet. The value of `s` is now equal to its original value plus 2 times the value of `x`, and the value of `m` is now equal to its original value times 4. The value of `x` remains the same, and the value of `n` is now equal to its original value divided by 2. If the condition `s < k and k <= s + x` is true, then the value of `n` is further divided by 4, and the value of `s` is updated to be equal to its original value plus `(n+1)//2 + (n+1)//4`. The value of `m` is also updated to be equal to its original value times 8.
