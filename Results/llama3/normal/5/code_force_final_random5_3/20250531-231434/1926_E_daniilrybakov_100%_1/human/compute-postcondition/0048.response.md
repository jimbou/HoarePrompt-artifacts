Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 3 and 5 * 10^4, and `_` is still 2. The stdin still contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, where n is non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, and k is an integer. The value of `s` is still equal to its original value plus (n + 1) // 2, and `m` is still equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1. The value of `x` is still an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
