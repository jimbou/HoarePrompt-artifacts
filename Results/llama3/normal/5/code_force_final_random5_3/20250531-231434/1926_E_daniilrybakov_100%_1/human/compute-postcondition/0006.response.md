Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is an integer equal to the ceiling of n/2, `n` is an integer equal to its original value divided by 2, the current value of `s` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `s + x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `s`, `m`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
