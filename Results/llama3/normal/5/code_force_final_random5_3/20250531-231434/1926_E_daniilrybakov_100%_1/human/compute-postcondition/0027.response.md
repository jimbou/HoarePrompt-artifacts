Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is not zero, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1, x is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus one, n is an integer equal to half of its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, _, s, m, x, and n remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and k, because we have already read one line in the previous iteration. The current value of s is still less than k, and k is still less than or equal to the sum of s and x.
