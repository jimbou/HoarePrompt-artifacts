Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x, m is equal to its original value times 2, x is an integer equal to the ceiling of n/2, n is an integer equal to its original value divided by 2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `s` is incremented by `x`, which is the ceiling of `n/2`. The value of `m` is doubled. The values of `x` and `n` are updated based on their original values, with `x` being the ceiling of `n/2` and `n` being divided by 2.
