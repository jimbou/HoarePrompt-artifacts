Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, and this is printed: (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m
Code of the loop:
while n:
    x = (n + 1) // 2
    n //= 2
    if s < k and k <= s + x:
        break
    s += x
    m *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 2, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-8 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2 times x plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 4, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4, n is an integer equal to n // 2. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-9 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 3 times x plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 8, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4, n is an integer greater than 0 and is half of its original value. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
