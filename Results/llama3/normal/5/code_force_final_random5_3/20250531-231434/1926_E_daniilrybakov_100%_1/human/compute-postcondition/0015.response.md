Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 4, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2x + (n+1)//2, m is equal to its original value times 4, x is an integer equal to (n+1)//4**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. The number of lines in stdin remains `t-2`, with each line containing two integers `n` and `k`.

The value of `n` is updated to be its original value divided by 4, as a result of the second line of the code. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

The value of `s` is updated to be its original value plus `2x` plus `(n+1)//2`, where `x` is the new value of `x` calculated in the first line of the code. The value of `m` is updated to be its original value times 4.

The value of `x` is updated to be `(n+1)//4`, which is the result of the first line of the code.
