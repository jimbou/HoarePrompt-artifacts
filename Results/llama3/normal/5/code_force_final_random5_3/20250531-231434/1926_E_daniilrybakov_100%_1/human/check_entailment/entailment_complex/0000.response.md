Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case using a `for` loop.

2. For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `k` and initializes variables `s` and `m` to 0 and 1, respectively.

3. The program then enters a `while` loop that continues until `n` becomes 0. In each iteration of the loop, the program calculates the number of odd-numbered cards `x` that are less than or equal to `n` using the formula `(n + 1) // 2`. It then updates `n` to `n // 2` and `m` to `m * 2`.

4. The program checks if `k` is within the range of the current iteration (i.e., `s < k and k <= s + x`). If it is, the program breaks out of the loop.

5. After the loop, the program calculates the `k`-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` and prints the result.

6. The program correctly handles the case where `k` is 1, in which case the `k`-th card is simply `m`.

7. The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is a power of 2, in which case the `k`-th card is `m * (k - 1)`.

8. The program's use of integer division (`//`) and multiplication (`*`) ensures that the calculations are performed correctly even for large values of `n` and `k`.

9. The program's use of a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop allows it to handle cases where `n` is not a power of 2.

10. The program's final state is correct, with all test cases having been processed and the corresponding results printed.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
