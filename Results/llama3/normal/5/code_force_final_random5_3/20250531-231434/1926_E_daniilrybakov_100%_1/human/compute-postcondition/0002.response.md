Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1**

The code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from the first line of stdin and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The variable `s` is initialized to 0, and the variable `m` is initialized to 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The variable `_` also remains unchanged, with a value of 0. Since one line has been read from stdin, it now contains `t-1` lines.
