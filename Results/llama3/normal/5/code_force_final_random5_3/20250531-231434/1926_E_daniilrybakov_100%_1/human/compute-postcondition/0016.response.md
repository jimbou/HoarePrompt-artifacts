Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value divided by 4, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2x + (n+1)//2, m is equal to its original value times 4, x is an integer equal to (n+1)//4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, _, n, k, s, m, and x remain the same as in the initial state, and the stdin still contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k.
