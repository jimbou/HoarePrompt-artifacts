Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is not zero, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1, x is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus one, n is an integer equal to half of its original value. If s < k and k <= s + x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
