Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus the sum of x in each iteration, m is equal to its original value times 2 to the power of the number of iterations.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 't' remains unchanged, the variable '_' remains unchanged, the input from stdin remains unchanged, the variable 'n' becomes 0, the variable 'k' remains unchanged, the variable 's' is updated to be the sum of its original value and the sum of 'x' in each iteration, and the variable 'm' is updated to be its original value multiplied by 2 to the power of the number of iterations.
