Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-9 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n must be non-zero and is the integer part of (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus 2 times x plus (n + 1) // 2, m is equal to 2 to the power of the number of iterations plus 1 times 4, x is an integer equal to (n + 1) // 4, n is an integer greater than 0 and is half of its original value. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
