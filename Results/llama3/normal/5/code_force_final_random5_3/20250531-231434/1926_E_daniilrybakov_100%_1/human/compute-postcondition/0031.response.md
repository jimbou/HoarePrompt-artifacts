Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to its original value plus x, m is equal to twice its original value, x is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus one divided by 2, n is an integer greater than 0 divided by 2**

The code modifies the values of `x` and `n`. The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `x`, effectively making `x` equal to half of the original value of `n` plus one. The second line divides `n` by 2, updating its value. The other variables remain unchanged.
