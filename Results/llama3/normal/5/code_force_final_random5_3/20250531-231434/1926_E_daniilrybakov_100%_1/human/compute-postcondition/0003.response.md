According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, n is an integer. An integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to n is not equal to 0.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1**
