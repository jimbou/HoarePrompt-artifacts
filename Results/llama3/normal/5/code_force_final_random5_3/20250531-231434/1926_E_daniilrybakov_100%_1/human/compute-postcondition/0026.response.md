Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and k, n is not zero, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1, x is an integer equal to half of the original value of n plus one, n is an integer equal to half of its original value, and this is printed: (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m. The current value of s is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of s and x.**
