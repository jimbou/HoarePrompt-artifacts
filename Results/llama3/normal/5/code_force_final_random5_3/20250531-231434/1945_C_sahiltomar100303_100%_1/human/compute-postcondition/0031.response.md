Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 3, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is mid + 2. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1, and rightOne and trightOne remain unchanged. If s[i] is '1', then rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1, and rightZero and trightZero remain unchanged.***
