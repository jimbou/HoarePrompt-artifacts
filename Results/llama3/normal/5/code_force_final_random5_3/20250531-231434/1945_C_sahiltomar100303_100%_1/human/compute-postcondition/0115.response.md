Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is at least 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 0. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0, and all other variables remain unchanged.***
