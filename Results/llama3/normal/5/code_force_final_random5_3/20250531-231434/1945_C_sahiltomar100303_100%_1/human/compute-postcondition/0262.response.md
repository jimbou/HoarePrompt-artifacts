Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, s is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is greater than 0 and sufficiently large to keep the conditions involving leftZero and rightOne true, leftZero is as previously described based on the state of s[left - 1], and rightOne is as previously described based on the state of s[left - 1] but now rightOne is incremented by 1 and leftOne is decremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 2. The string `s` still allows for a distribution where the second condition can be met. The value of `mid` remains the same, equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0. The value of `t` is still greater than 0. The value of `i` remains equal to `n`. The value of `left` is still greater than 0 and sufficiently large to keep the conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` true. The value of `leftZero` remains the same, based on the state of `s[left - 1]`. The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1, and the value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1.
