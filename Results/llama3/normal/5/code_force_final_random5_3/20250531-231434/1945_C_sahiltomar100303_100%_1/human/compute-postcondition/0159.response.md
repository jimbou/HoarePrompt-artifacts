Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2`, `right` is equal to `mid`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the values of `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged. The relationships between `leftZero` and `mid`, and `rightOne` and `n` and `mid` are still valid.
