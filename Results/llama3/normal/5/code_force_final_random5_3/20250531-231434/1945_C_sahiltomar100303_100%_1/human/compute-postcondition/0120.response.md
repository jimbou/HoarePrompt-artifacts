The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and mid, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `mid` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `mid` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is at least 3, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 2. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 2, tleftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then leftOne is 2, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 0, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0.**
