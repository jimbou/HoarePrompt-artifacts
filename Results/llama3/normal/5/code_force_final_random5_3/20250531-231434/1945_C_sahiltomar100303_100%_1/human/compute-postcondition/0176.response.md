Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is less than `n - 3`, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 3) // 2`, `right` is `mid + 3`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid - 2) // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, and `trightOne` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is decreased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been increased by 1, which means it is now `mid + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged, but the conditions related to `rightOne` and `leftZero` are still valid. Note that `mid` is now less than `n - 3` because `right` has moved one step to the right.
