Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2 plus 1, rightZero is either rightZero or rightZero - 2, leftOne is either leftOne or leftOne + 1, rightOne is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, and right is less than n**

The code increments `leftZero` by 1 and decrements `rightZero` by 1. The initial state of `leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2`, so after incrementing, it becomes less than `(right + 1) // 2 plus 1`. The initial state of `rightZero` is either `rightZero` or `rightZero - 1`, so after decrementing, it becomes either `rightZero` or `rightZero - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
