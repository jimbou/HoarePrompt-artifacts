Output State: **tleftZero is less than or equal to (right + 1) // 2, trightZero is less than (n - right + 1) // 2, right is less than n**

The code increments `tleftZero` by 1 and decrements `trightZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` was less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, after the increment, `tleftZero` is now less than or equal to `(right + 1) // 2`. Similarly, since `trightZero` was not constrained by any condition, after the decrement, `trightZero` is now less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. The value of `right` remains unchanged, so it is still less than `n`.
