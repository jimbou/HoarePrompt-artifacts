Postcondition: **The value of either `left` or `right` is printed, depending on whether `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus 1, divided by 2. If `rightOne` meets this condition, the value of `left`, which is 0, is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right`, which is equal to `n`, is printed.**
