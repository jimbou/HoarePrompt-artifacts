Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2`, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2`. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value. If `s[right - 1]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is one less than its original value, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value, and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and its new value is `mid + 1`. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain the same as before, but the conditions related to `s[right]` are now applied to `s[right - 1]`.
