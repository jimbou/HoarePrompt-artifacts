Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `right` is less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `rightZero` is decreased by 1, while `leftOne` and `rightOne` remain unchanged. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is incremented by 1 and `rightOne` is decremented by 1, while `leftZero` and `rightZero` remain unchanged.***
