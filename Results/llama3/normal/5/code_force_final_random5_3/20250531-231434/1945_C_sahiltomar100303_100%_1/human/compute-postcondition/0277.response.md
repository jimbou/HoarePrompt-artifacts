Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `right` is less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` plus 1, `rightZero` is either `rightZero` or `rightZero - 2`, `leftOne` is either `leftOne` or `leftOne + 1`, and `rightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero` or `rightZero - 1`, `leftOne` is either `leftOne + 1` or `leftOne + 2`, and `rightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2` and is either `rightOne - 1` or `rightOne - 2`***
