Output State: **left is 0, mid is less than n - 2, leftZero is less than (mid + 3) // 2 and equals to its original value plus 1, right is mid + 2, rightOne is less than (n - mid - 1) // 2, tleftZero is its original value plus 1, trightZero is its original value minus 1.**

The code increments `tleftZero` by 1 and decrements `trightZero` by 1. The value of `tleftZero` is increased by 1, and the value of `trightZero` is decreased by 1. No other variables are affected.
