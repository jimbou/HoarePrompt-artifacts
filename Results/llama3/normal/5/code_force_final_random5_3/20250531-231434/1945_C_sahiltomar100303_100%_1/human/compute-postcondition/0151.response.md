Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2` minus 1 and `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2` plus 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, and `leftOne` is less than `leftZero`.***
