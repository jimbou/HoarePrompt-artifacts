Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1. The current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**
