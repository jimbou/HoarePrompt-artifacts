Postcondition: ***`left` is not equal to 0, `right` is equal to `n`, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `rightOne` is 0. If `left` is not equal to 0, the value of `left` is being printed. If `left` is equal to 0, then if `leftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of `right` which is `n` is being printed. Otherwise, 0 is being printed.***
