Output State: **right** is equal to **n**, **left** is the minimum value between **n // 2** and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false, **leftZero** is the number of zeros in the first half of **s**, **rightZero** is the number of zeros in the second half of **s**, **rightOne** is the number of ones in the second half of **s**, and **leftMove** is 0.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the right pointer has reached the end of the string **s**, the left pointer is at the minimum value between the middle of the string and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false, the number of zeros in the first and second halves of the string are updated accordingly, the number of ones in the second half of the string is updated, and the left move counter remains 0.
