Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 3, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is mid + 2, rightZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is incremented by 1, rightOne remains unchanged, trightOne remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only increments `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1, so their new values are their original values plus 1. The values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
