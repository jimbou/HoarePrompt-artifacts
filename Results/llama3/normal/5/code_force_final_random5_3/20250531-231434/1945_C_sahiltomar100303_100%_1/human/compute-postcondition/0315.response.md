Output: **left is not equal to 0, leftZero is less than or equal to right // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2, leftOne is less than or equal to right // 2, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2, and right is not equal to n. The current value of left is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the sequence (n+1)//2 as the current value of right, and the value of left is printed**
