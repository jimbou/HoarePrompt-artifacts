Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`. If the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', then `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftZero` is one less than the number of '0's in the string `s`, `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'. Otherwise, `left` is `mid`, `leftOne` is one less than the number of '1's in the string `s`, `rightOne` is one more than the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'. In both cases, `right` is either 0 or `n`, `leftMove` is 0, and `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` are equal to the number of '0's and '1's in the string `s` and its second half, respectively.**
