Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is 1. If s[i] is '0', leftZero and tleftZero are incremented by 1, and the values of leftOne and tleftOne remain unchanged. If s[i] is not '0', leftZero and tleftZero are unchanged, and leftOne and tleftOne are incremented by 1.***
