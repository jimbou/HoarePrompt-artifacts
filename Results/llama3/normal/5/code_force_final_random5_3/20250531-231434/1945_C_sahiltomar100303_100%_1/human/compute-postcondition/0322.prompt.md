Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if left != 0:
            print(left)
        elif tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *Either the value of `left` or `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `left` is printed if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus 1, divided by 2, or if `left` is not 0. Otherwise, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value that is closer to the middle index (n+1)//2 is printed, or the value of `right` is printed if `left` is 0 and `tleftZero` is less than half of the value of `n` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`left` and `right` are either 0 or `n`, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `rightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `left` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` is printed. If `left` is not equal to 0, then if `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `left` is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of either `left` or `right` is printed, whichever is closer to or equally distant from the middle index of `n` (i.e., `(n + 1) // 2`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: left, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, rightOne are integers. leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, rightOne are less than or equal to half of the right and n - right + 1 respectively. If right is equal to n, then if left is not equal to 0, the value of left is printed. If left is equal to 0, then if leftZero is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of right which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left which is 0 is printed. If right is not equal to n, then the value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the sequence (n+1)//2. If left is 0 and right is not equal to n, the value of right is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
