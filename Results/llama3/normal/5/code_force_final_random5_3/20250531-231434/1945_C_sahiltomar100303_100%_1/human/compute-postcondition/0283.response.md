Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is less than or equal to `n`. If `s[right-1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `rightZero` is decreased by 1, while `leftOne` and `rightOne` remain unchanged. If `s[right-1]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is incremented by 1 and `rightOne` is decremented by 1, while `leftZero` and `rightZero` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `n`. The conditions for `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are still dependent on the value of `s[right-1]`, which is the character at the previous index of `right`. The value of `left` remains unchanged at 0.
