Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1 and s[left - 1] is '1', mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is n, rightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s plus one if s[left - 1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, trightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s plus one if s[left - 1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, rightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s and must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, trightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s, left is n // 2 - 1, leftMove is 0, leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2 minus one if s[left - 1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, and leftOne is one less than its original value**

The code decrements `leftOne` by 1 and increments `rightOne` by 1. The value of `s[left - 1]` is now '1' because it was '0' initially. The number of zeros in the second half of `s` remains the same, so `rightZero` and `trightZero` are unchanged. The number of ones in the second half of `s` increases by 1, so `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1. The value of `leftOne` is one less than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
