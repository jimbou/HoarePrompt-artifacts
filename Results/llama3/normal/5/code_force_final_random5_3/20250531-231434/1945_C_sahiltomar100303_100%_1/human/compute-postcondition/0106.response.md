Postcondition: **right and left are not equal to 0. If right is equal to n, then if left is not 0, the value of left is printed. If left is 0, and tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of the value of n plus 1, the value of right which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left which is 0 is printed. If right is not equal to n, the value that is closer to the middle index (n+1)//2 is printed.**
