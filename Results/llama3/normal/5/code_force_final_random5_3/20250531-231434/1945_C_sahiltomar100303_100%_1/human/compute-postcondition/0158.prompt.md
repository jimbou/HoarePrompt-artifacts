Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is n - 1, left is mid, leftMove is 0, rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` are unchanged. If the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is not '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is incremented by 1, `leftOne` is decremented by 1, and `trightOne` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2` minus 1 and `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2` plus 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, and `leftOne` is less than `leftZero`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than 4, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `mid - 3`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2` minus 1 and `rightZero` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value and `rightOne` is one more than its original value, while `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2` and `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
