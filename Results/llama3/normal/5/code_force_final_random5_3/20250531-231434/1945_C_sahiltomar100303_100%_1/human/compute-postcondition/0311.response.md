Postcondition: **left, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, rightOne are integers. leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, rightOne are less than or equal to half of the right and n - right + 1 respectively. If left is not equal to 0, the value of left is printed. If left is equal to 0, then if leftZero is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of right which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left which is 0 is printed.**
