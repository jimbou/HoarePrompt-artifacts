Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `i` is `n`, `rightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s` plus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `trightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s` plus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `left` being `n // 2 - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
