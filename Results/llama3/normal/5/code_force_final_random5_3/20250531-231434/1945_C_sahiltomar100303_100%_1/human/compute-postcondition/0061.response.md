Output State: **right is less than n, left is the minimum value between n // 2 and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false, tleftZero is one more than its original value, trightZero is one less than its original value, leftZero, rightZero, rightOne, leftMove, and tleftOne remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `right`, `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftMove`, and `tleftOne` remain the same as in the initial state, as they are not modified by the code. The code only increments `tleftZero` by 1 and decrements `trightZero` by 1, resulting in the updated values of these two variables.
