Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left is mid, right is either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the string s, leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the string s, rightZero and trightZero are equal to the number of '0's in the second half of s, and rightOne and trightOne are equal to the number of '1's in the second half of s, leftMove is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`. If the character at index `left - 2` in the string `s` is '0', then `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftZero` is one less than the number of '0's in the string `s`, `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, and the current value of `s[left - 2]` is '1'. Otherwise, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftOne` is one less than the number of '1's in the string `s`, `rightOne` is one more than the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, and the character at index `left - 2` in the string `s` is not '0'. In both cases, `right` is either 0 or `n`, `leftMove` is 0, and `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` are equal to the number of '0's and '1's in the string `s` and its second half, respectively.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and less than its original value by 1. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is greater than its original value by 1 and `rightOne` is less than (`n - left + 1`) // 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is greater than 0 and `rightOne` is greater than 0, and `leftZero` is less than (`left + 1`) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and sufficiently large to keep the conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` true, and one less than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
