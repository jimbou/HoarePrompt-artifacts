Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid - 1. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is mid, tleftZero is mid, rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then leftOne is mid, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is mid, trightOne is 0, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are each incremented by 1. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then rightOne and trightOne are each incremented by 2 and 1 respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid + 1. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1, and rightOne and trightOne remain unchanged. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then rightZero and trightZero remain unchanged, and rightOne is incremented by 3 and trightOne is incremented by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `mid + 2`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are each incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
