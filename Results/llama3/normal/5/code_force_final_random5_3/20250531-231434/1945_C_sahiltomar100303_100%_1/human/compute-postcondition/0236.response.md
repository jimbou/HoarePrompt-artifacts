Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than mid, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0 and less than n, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to mid, leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of s, leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is one more than the number of '1's in the second half of s, and trightOne is one more than the number of '1's in the second half of s. The character at index i in string s is not '0'.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `left`, `right`, `t`, `i`, `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `leftOne`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The only changes are to `rightOne` and `trightOne`, which are both incremented by 1, indicating that the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` has increased by 1.
