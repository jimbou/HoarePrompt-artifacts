Postcondition: ***`left` is not equal to 0, `right` is either equal to `n` or not, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `rightOne` is 0. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `left` is not equal to 0, the value of `left` is printed. If `left` is equal to 0, then if `leftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of `right` which is `n` is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of either `left` or `right` is printed, whichever is closer to or equally distant from the middle index of `n` (i.e., `(n + 1) // 2`).***
