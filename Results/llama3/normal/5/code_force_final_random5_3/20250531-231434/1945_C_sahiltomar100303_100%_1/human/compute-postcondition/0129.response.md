Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid, the character at index i of string s is not '0', rightOne is incremented by 2, trightOne is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `stdin`, `i`, and the character at index `i` of string `s` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are the increments to `rightOne` and `trightOne`, which are both incremented by 1.
