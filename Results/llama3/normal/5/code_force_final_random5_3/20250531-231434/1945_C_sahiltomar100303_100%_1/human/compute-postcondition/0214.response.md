Postcondition: ***`left` and `right` are either 0 or `n`, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `rightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `left` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` is printed. If `left` is not equal to 0, then if `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `left` is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of either `left` or `right` is printed, whichever is closer to or equally distant from the middle index of `n` (i.e., `(n + 1) // 2`).***
