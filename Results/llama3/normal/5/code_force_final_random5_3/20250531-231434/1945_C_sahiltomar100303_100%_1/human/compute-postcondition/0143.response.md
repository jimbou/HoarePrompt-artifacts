Output State: **n is greater than 0, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is n - 1, left is mid, leftMove is 0, rightZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is incremented by 1, rightOne is unchanged, trightOne is unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `trightZero`. The first line decrements `leftZero` by 1, and the second line increments `rightZero` by 1. Since the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0', `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
