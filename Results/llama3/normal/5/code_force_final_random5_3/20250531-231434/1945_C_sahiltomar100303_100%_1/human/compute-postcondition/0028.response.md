The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mid, and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `mid`, and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `mid + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `mid + 2`. For the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 3`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `i` is `mid + 2`, if `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1, otherwise `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1**
