Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is mid - 1. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero is mid, tleftZero is mid and leftOne, tleftOne, rightZero, trightZero, rightOne, trightOne are 0. If the current value of s[i] is '1', then leftOne is mid, tleftOne is mid, leftZero is mid - 1, tleftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, rightOne is 0, trightOne is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 0.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive).
- The value of `s` remains unchanged, still a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1.
- The value of `mid` remains unchanged, still an integer equal to `n // 2`.
- The value of `i` is now `mid - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `mid` times.
- If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are equal to `mid`, and `leftOne`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` are all 0.
- If the current value of `s[i]` is '1', then `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are equal to `mid`, `leftZero` is `mid - 1`, and `tleftZero`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` are all 0.
