Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is mid + 1, rightZero is incremented by 0, trightZero is incremented by 0, rightOne is incremented by 1, trightOne is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 0, meaning they remain the same as before. The values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1, meaning they are each increased by 1 from their previous values.
