Postcondition: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is mid + 1, if s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1, otherwise rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.**
