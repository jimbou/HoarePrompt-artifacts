Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, and i is 0. If s[i] is '0', then leftZero, tleftZero are 1 and all other variables are 0. If s[i] is not '0', then leftOne, tleftOne are 1 and all other variables are 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is 1. If s[i] is '0', leftZero and tleftZero are incremented by 1, and the values of leftOne and tleftOne remain unchanged. If s[i] is not '0', leftZero and tleftZero are unchanged, and leftOne and tleftOne are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is 2. If s[i] is '0', leftZero and tleftZero are incremented by 1, and the values of leftOne and tleftOne remain unchanged. If s[i] is not '0', leftZero and tleftZero are unchanged, and leftOne and tleftOne are incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
