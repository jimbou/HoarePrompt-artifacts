Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is at least 3, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 2. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 3, tleftZero is 3, rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then leftOne is 2, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 0, leftZero is 2, rightZero is 0.**

The code increments `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` were initially 2, so they become 3. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` were initially 1, so they become 2. No other variables are affected.
