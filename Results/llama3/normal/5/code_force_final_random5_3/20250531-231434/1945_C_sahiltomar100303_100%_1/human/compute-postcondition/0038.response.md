Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is n, rightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s, trightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s, rightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s and must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, trightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s, left is n // 2, leftMove is 0, leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, leftOne is one less than its original value, and the character at index left - 1 of s is '1'.**

In this final state, all variables retain their original values except for `leftOne`, which has been decremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, and `leftMove`. The character at index `left - 1` of `s` is still '1'.
