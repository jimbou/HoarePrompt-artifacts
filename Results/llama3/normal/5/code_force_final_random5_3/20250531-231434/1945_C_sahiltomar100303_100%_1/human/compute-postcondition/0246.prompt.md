Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is mid. leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of s, and leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of s.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `mid`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0 and less than `n`, `left` and `right` are either 0 or `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `mid`, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of `s` plus one, and `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of `s`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is one more than the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, and `trightOne` is one more than the number of '1's in the second half of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than mid, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0 and less than n, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to mid + 1. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of s plus one, leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightZero is one more than its original value, and trightZero is one more than its original value. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of s, leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is two more than the number of '1's in the second half of s, and trightOne is two more than the number of '1's in the second half of s.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0 and less than n, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to mid + 2. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of s plus one, leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightZero is one more than its original value, and trightZero is one more than its original value. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of s, leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is two more than the number of '1's in the second half of s, and trightOne is two more than the number of '1's in the second half of s.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
