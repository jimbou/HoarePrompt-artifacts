Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, `trightOne` is one more than its original value. `right` is equal to `mid + 1`. If `s[right - 1]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2 - 1` if `s[right]` is '0', and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2 - 2` if `s[right]` is not '0'. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2` if `s[right]` is '0', and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2 - 1` if `s[right]` is not '0'.***
