Postcondition: ***`right` is less than `n`, `left` will be the minimum value between `n // 2` and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false, `leftZero` and `rightZero` will be the number of zeros in the first and second halves of `s`, respectively, after the loop terminates, `rightOne` will be the number of ones in the second half of `s` after the loop terminates, `leftMove` will still be 0, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0'***
