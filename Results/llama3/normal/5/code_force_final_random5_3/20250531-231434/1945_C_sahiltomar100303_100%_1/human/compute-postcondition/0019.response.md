Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 1, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `i` is `mid`, `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightOne` are as before. The current value of `s[i]` is '0'.***
