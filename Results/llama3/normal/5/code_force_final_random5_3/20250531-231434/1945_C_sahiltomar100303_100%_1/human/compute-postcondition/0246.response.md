Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the string s, leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the string s, rightZero and trightZero are equal to the number of '0's in the second half of s, and rightOne and trightOne are equal to the number of '1's in the second half of s.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `leftOne`, and `tleftOne` will be equal to the total number of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The values of `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` will be equal to the number of '0's and '1's in the second half of the string `s`, respectively. The value of `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire string. The other variables remain unchanged.
