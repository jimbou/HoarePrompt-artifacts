Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `left` variable has reached 0, indicating that the loop has finished iterating. Additionally, the number of zeros in the left half of the string (`leftZero`) is less than or equal to half of the middle index (`mid // 2`), and the number of ones in the right half of the string (`rightOne`) is less than or equal to half of the remaining characters in the string (`(n - mid + 1) // 2`).
