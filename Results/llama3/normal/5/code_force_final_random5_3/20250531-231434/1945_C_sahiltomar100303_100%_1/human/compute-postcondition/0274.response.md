According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne`. If `right` is less than `n` and (`leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `rightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is less than or equal to `n`, `leftZero` is either `leftZero` or `leftZero + 1`, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne` or `rightOne - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `right` must be less than `n`, and either `leftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `rightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. Since `right` is less than or equal to `n`, it needs to be adjusted to `right` is less than `n`. Also, since `leftZero` is either `leftZero` or `leftZero + 1`, it needs to be adjusted to `leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2`. Similarly, since `rightOne` is either `rightOne` or `rightOne - 1`, it needs to be adjusted to `rightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero` or `rightZero - 1`, `leftOne` is either `leftOne` or `leftOne + 1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, and `right` is less than `n`**
