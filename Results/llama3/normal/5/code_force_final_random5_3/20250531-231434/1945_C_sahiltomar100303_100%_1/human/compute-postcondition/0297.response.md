Postcondition: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to right // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2, leftOne is less than or equal to right // 2, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2. If right is not equal to n, the value of right is printed. If right is equal to n, then if rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of left which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is equal to n is printed.**
