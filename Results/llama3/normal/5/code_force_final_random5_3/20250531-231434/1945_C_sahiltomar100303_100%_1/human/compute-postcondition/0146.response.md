Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is n - 1, left is mid, leftMove is 0. If the character at index left - 1 of string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1, and rightOne and trightOne are unchanged. If the character at index left - 1 of string s is not '0', then rightZero is incremented by 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise rightOne is incremented by 1, leftOne is decremented by 1, and trightOne is incremented by 1.***
