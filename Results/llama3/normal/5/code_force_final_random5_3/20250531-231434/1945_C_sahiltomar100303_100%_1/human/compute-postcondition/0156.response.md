Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2` minus 1 and `rightZero` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value and `rightOne` is one more than its original value, while `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2` and `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`***
