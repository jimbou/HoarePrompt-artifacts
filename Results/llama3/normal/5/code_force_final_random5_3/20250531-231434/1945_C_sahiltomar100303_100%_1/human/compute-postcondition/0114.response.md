Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is at least 1, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 0, and the character at index i of string s is not '0'**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` and `tleftOne` were initially 0, they both become 1 after the execution of the code. No other variables are affected by the code.
