Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is at least 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 1, leftZero is 2, tleftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0**

The code increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` and `tleftZero` were initially 1, they become 2 after the code executes. All other variables remain unchanged.
