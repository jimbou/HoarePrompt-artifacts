Postcondition: **left, leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, rightOne are integers. leftZero, rightZero, leftOne, rightOne are less than or equal to half of the right and n - right + 1 respectively. If right is equal to n, then if left is not equal to 0, the value of left is printed. If left is equal to 0, then if leftZero is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of right which is equal to n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left which is 0 is printed. If right is not equal to n, then the value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the sequence (n+1)//2. If left is 0 and right is not equal to n, the value of right is printed.**
