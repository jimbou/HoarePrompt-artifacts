Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and must be at least 2, i is 1, leftZero is 2, tleftZero is 2, leftOne is 0, tleftOne is 0, rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, rightOne is 0, trightOne is 0.**

The code increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` and `tleftZero` were initially 1, they become 2. No other variables are affected by the code.
