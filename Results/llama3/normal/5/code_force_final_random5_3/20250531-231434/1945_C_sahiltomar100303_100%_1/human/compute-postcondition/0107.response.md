Postcondition: ***Either the value of `left` or `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `left` is printed if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus 1, divided by 2, or if `left` is not 0. Otherwise, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the value that is closer to the middle index (n+1)//2 is printed, or the value of `right` is printed if `left` is 0 and `tleftZero` is less than half of the value of `n` plus 1.***
