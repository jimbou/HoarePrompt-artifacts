Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid + 1. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1, and rightOne and trightOne remain unchanged. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then rightZero and trightZero remain unchanged, and rightOne is incremented by 3 and trightOne is incremented by 2.***
