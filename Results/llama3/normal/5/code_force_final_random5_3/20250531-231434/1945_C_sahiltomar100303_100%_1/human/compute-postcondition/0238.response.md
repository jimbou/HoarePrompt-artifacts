State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `mid`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0 and less than `n`, `left` and `right` are either 0 or `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `mid + 1`, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of `s` plus one, and `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of `s`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is one more than the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, and `trightOne` is one more than the number of '1's in the second half of `s`.**
