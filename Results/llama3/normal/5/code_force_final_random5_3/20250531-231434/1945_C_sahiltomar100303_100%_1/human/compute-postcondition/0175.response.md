Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `mid` is less than `n - 2`, `leftZero` is less than `(mid + 3) // 2`, `right` is `mid + 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, and `trightOne` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is decreased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.***
