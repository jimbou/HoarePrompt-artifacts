To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mid`, and `n`. The loop will execute if `mid` is less than `n`. Since `mid` is `n` divided by 2, we can infer that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to `mid`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `mid`**
