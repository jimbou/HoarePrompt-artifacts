The code prints the value of `right` which is not equal to 0 and not equal to `n`. The exact value of `right` is not provided, but based on the precondition, it is known that the absolute difference between `(n+1)/2` and `left` is larger than the absolute difference between `(n+1)/2` and `right`.

Output: **right (where right is a value not equal to 0 and not equal to n, and is closer to (n+1)/2 than left)**
