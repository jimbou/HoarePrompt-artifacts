Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are each incremented by 1. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then rightOne and trightOne are each incremented by 2 and 1 respectively.***
