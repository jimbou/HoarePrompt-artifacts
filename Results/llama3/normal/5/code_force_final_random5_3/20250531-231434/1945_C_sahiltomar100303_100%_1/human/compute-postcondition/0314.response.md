The code prints the current value of `left`, which is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the sequence `(n+1)//2` as the current value of `right`. Since the exact value of `left` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `left`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current value of `left`.

Output: **the current value of left (which is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the sequence (n+1)//2 as the current value of right)**
