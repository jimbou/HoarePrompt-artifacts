Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than mid, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0 and less than n, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to mid + 1, if the character at index i in string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of s plus one, and leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of s. If the character at index i in string s is not '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of s, leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is two more than the number of '1's in the second half of s, and trightOne is two more than the number of '1's in the second half of s.**

The code increments `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', the values of `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `leftOne`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', the values of `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `leftOne`, and `tleftOne` also remain unchanged, but `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1, making them two more than the number of '1's in the second half of `s`.
