Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is at least 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 1. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 2, tleftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then leftOne is 2, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 0, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0.***
