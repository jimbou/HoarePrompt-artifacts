To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mid`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `mid`, which is `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `mid + 1`.
* `mid` remains the same, as it is not dependent on the loop iteration.
* `n` remains the same, as it is not dependent on the loop iteration.

The other variables, `t`, `stdin`, `s`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1**
