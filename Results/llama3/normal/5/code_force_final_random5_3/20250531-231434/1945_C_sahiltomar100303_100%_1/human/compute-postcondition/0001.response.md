To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` since it's the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
