Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `rightOne` is 0.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `left` remains unchanged at 0, and the value of `right` has reached the end of the string `s` at index `n`. The value of `leftZero` has increased by at most half the length of the string `s`, and the value of `rightOne` has decreased to 0.
