Output State: **`right` is less than or equal to `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(right + 1) // 2` and `trightZero` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.**

The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `n`. The conditions for `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are still valid, but the values of `tleftOne` and `trightOne` may have changed if `s[right]` is '1'.
