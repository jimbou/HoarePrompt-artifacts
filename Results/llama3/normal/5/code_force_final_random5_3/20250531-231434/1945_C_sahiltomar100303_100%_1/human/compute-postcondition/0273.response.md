Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either `leftZero` or `leftZero + 1`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero` or `rightZero - 1`, `leftOne` is either `leftOne` or `leftOne + 1`, `rightOne` is either `rightOne` or `rightOne - 1`, and `right` is less than or equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1. The values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` depend on the value of `s[right]`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `rightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is increased by 1 and `rightOne` is decreased by 1. The value of `left` remains unchanged.
