The code prints the current value of `left`, which is closer to or equally distant from the middle index of `n` (i.e., `(n + 1) // 2`) compared to the current value of `right`. Since the exact value of `left` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `left`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current value of `left`.

Output: **the current value of left (which is closer to or equally distant from the middle index of n)**
