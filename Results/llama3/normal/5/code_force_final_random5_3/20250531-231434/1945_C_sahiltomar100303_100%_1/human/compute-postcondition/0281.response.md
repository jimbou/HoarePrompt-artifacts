Output State: **left is 0, right is less than n, leftZero remains unchanged, rightZero remains unchanged, leftOne is incremented by 1, rightOne is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `leftZero` and `rightZero` also remain unchanged as their adjustment depends on the value of `s[right - 1]` and the loop body's execution, which is not executed in this code snippet. The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1, and the value of `rightOne` is decremented by 1 due to the execution of the code.
