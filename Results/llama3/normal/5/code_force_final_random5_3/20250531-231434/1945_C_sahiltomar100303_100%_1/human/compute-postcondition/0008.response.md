Postcondition: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and must be at least 1, i is 0. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero, tleftZero are 1 and leftOne, tleftOne, rightZero, trightZero, rightOne, trightOne are 0. If the current value of s[i] is '1', then leftOne, tleftOne are 1 and leftZero, tleftZero, rightZero, trightZero, rightOne, trightOne are 0.**
