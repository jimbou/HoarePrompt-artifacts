Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is mid - 1. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero is mid, tleftZero is mid and leftOne, tleftOne, rightZero, trightZero, rightOne, trightOne are 0. If the current value of s[i] is '1', then leftOne is mid, tleftOne is mid, leftZero is mid - 1, tleftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, rightOne is 0, trightOne is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 1, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is mid, if s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1, otherwise, rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is mid + 1, if s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1, otherwise rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than or equal to mid + 3, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is mid + 2. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are incremented by 1, and rightOne and trightOne remain unchanged. If s[i] is '1', then rightOne and trightOne are incremented by 1, and rightZero and trightZero remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
