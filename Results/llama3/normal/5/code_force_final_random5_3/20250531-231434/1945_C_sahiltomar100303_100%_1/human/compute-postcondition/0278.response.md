Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is less than or equal to `n`. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than `right // 2` plus 1, `rightZero` is either `rightZero` or `rightZero - 2`, `leftOne` is either `leftOne` or `leftOne + 1`, and `rightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. If `s[right - 1]` is not '0', then `leftZero` is less than `right // 2`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero` or `rightZero - 1`, `leftOne` is either `leftOne + 1` or `leftOne + 2`, and `rightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2` and is either `rightOne - 1` or `rightOne - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and the conditions for `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` have been updated accordingly based on the value of `s[right - 1]`. The value of `left` remains unchanged at 0.
