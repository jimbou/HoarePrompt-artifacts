Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, s is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, left is greater than 0. If s[left - 1] is '0', then leftZero is greater than its original value by 1 and rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2. Otherwise, leftOne is greater than 0 and rightOne is greater than 0, and leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2.***
