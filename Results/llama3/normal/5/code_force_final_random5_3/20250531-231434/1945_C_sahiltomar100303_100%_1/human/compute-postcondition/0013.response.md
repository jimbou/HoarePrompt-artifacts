The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and mid, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `mid` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `mid` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and must be at least 3, i is 2. If the current value of s[i] is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are 2 and leftOne, tleftOne, rightZero, trightZero, rightOne, trightOne are 0. If the current value of s[i] is '1', then leftOne and tleftOne are 2 and leftZero, tleftZero, rightZero, trightZero, rightOne, trightOne are 0.**
