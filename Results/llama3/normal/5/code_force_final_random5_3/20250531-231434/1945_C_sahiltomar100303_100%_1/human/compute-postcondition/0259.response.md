Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and less than its original value by 1. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is greater than its original value by 1 and `rightOne` is less than (`n - left + 1`) // 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is greater than 0 and `rightOne` is greater than 0, and `leftZero` is less than (`left + 1`) // 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `leftZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` still hold, but with the updated value of `left`.
