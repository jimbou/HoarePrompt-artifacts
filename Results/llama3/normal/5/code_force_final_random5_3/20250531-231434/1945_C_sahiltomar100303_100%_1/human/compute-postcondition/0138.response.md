Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `mid + 2`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are each incremented by 1.***
