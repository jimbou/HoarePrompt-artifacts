The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` and then a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1. Since `t` is assigned the first input from the first test case, `t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), and stdin now contains the remaining test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
