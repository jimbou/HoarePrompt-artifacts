Postcondition: **`right` is less than `n`, `left` is the minimum value between `n // 2` and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false, `leftZero` and `rightZero` are the number of zeros in the first and second halves of `s`, respectively, after the loop terminates, `rightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s` after the loop terminates, `leftMove` is still 0, and the current value of `s[right]` is '0'.**
