The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and mid, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `mid` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `mid` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and must be at least 2, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero`, `tleftZero` are 1 and `leftOne`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightOne` are 0. If the current value of `s[i]` is '1', then `leftOne`, `tleftOne` are 1 and `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightOne` are 0.**
