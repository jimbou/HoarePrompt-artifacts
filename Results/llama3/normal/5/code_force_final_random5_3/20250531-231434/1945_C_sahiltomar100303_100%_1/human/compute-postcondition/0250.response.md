Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left is mid - 1, right is either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, leftZero is one less than the number of '0's in the string s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0's in the string s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1's in the string s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1's in the string s, rightZero is one more than the number of '0's in the second half of s, trightZero is equal to the number of '0's in the second half of s, rightOne is equal to the number of '1's in the second half of s, trightOne is equal to the number of '1's in the second half of s, leftMove is 0. The current value of s[left - 1] is '1'.**

The first line decrements the value of `leftZero` by 1, which means it now represents one less than the number of '0's in the string `s`. The second line increments the value of `rightZero` by 1, which means it now represents one more than the number of '0's in the second half of `s`. No other variables are affected by the code.
