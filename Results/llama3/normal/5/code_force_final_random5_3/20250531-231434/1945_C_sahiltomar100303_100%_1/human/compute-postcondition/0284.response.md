Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to right // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2, leftOne is less than or equal to right // 2, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2, and right is equal to n.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `left` remains 0, and the values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are all less than or equal to the corresponding half of the string `s`. The value of `right` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire string.
