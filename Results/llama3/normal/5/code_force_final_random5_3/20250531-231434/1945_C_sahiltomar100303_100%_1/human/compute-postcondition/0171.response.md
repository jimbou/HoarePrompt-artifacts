Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, `trightOne` is one more than its original value. `right` is equal to `mid + 2`. If `s[right - 2]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2 - 1` if `s[right - 1]` is '0', and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2 - 2` if `s[right - 1]` is not '0'. If `s[right - 2]` is '0', then `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2` if `s[right - 1]` is '0', and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid) // 2 - 1` if `s[right - 1]` is not '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and the conditions for `leftZero`, `trightOne`, and `rightOne` remain the same as in the initial state, but with `right` now equal to `mid + 2`. The value of `left` remains unchanged at 0.
