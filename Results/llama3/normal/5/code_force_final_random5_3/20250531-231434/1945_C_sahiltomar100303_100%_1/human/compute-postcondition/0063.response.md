Postcondition: ***`right` is less than `n`, `left` is the minimum value between `n // 2` and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value, `trightZero` is one less than its original value, and all other variables remain unchanged. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is the number of zeros in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s` minus one, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value, and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.***
