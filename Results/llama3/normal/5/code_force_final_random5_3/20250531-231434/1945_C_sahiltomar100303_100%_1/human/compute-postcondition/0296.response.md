Postcondition: ***left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to right // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2, leftOne is less than or equal to right // 2, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2, and right is not equal to n. If rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of left which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is not equal to n is being printed.***
