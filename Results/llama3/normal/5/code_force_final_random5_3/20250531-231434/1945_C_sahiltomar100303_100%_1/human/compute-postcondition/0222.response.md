Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, and i is 0. If s[i] is '0', then leftZero, tleftZero are 1 and all other variables are 0. If s[i] is not '0', then leftOne, tleftOne are 1 and all other variables are 0.***
