To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mid`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid`, which is `n` divided by 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is `mid + 1`
* `mid` remains the same, as it is not updated in the loop head
* `n` remains the same, as it is not updated in the loop head

The other variables, such as `s`, `stdin`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne`, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string, `mid` is `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 2 and 1 respectively if the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0'**
