Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2, rightZero is either rightZero or rightZero - 1, leftOne is either leftOne + 1 or leftOne + 2, rightOne is less than (n - right + 1) // 2 and is either rightOne - 1 or rightOne - 2, and right is less than n**

In this output state, the value of `left` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `leftZero` is still less than `(right + 1) // 2`, as it was not modified by the code. The value of `rightZero` is either its original value or one less than its original value, as it was not directly modified by the code but could have been affected by the changes to `rightOne`. The value of `leftOne` is either its original value plus one or its original value plus two, as it was incremented by one. The value of `rightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2` and is either its original value minus one or its original value minus two, as it was decremented by one. The value of `right` remains less than `n`, as it was not modified by the code.
