Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `right` is assigned the value of `mid`, the loop terminates when either `left` becomes 0 or the condition `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` is no longer true, `left` will be the minimum value between `n // 2` and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false, `leftZero` and `rightZero` will be the number of zeros in the first and second halves of `s`, respectively, after the loop terminates, `rightOne` will be the number of ones in the second half of `s` after the loop terminates, `leftMove` will still be 0.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `right` is less than or equal to `n`, `left` is the minimum value between `n // 2` and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `rightZero` is decreased by 1, with all other variables remaining unchanged. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is the number of zeros in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s` minus one, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value, and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `right` is less than or equal to `n`, `left` is the minimum value between `n // 2` and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value, `trightZero` is one less than its original value, and all other variables remain unchanged. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is the number of zeros in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s` minus one, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value, and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `right` is less than or equal to `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(right + 1) // 2` and `trightZero` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
