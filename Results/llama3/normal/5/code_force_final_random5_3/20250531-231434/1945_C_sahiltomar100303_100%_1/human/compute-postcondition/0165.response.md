Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `mid // 2`, `right` is equal to `mid`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is one less than its original value, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value, and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.***
