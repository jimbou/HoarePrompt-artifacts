Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is n, rightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s, trightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s, rightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s, trightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s, left is n // 2, leftMove is 0
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `i` is `n`, `rightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s` plus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `trightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s` plus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1' if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `i` is `n`, `rightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s` plus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `trightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s` plus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 5 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is n, rightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s plus one if s[left] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, trightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s plus one if s[left] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, rightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s and must be less than (n - left) // 2, trightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s, left is n // 2 - 3, leftMove is 0, leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2 minus one if s[left] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, leftZero must be less than (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne must be less than (n - left) // 2. If s[left] is '0', leftZero is one less than its original value, rightZero is one more than its original value. If s[left] is not '0', leftOne is one less than its original value, rightOne is one more than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
