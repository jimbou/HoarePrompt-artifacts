Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is 1, leftZero is its original value, tleftZero is its original value, leftOne is its original value plus 1, and tleftOne is its original value plus 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `left`, `right`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. However, the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are incremented by 1 due to the code.
