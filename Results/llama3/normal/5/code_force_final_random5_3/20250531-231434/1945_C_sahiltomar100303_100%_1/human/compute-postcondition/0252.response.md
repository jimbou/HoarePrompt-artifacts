Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0, left is mid, right is either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to n, leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the string s, leftOne is one less than the number of '1's in the string s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1's in the string s, rightZero and trightZero are equal to the number of '0's in the second half of s, rightOne is one more than the number of '1's in the second half of s, and trightOne is equal to the number of '1's in the second half of s, leftMove is 0. The character at index left - 1 in the string s is not '0'.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `mid`, `left`, `right`, `t`, `i`, `leftZero`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, and `leftMove` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `s` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1, and the value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The values of `tleftOne` and `trightOne` remain the same as they are not modified by the code. The character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is still not '0'.
