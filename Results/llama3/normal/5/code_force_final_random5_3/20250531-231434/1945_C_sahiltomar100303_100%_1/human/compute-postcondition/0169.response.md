Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to mid // 2, right is equal to mid + 1, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - mid) // 2 - 2 if s[right - 1] is not '0', and rightOne is less than or equal to (n - mid) // 2 - 1, tleftOne is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `leftZero`, and `right` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `rightOne` is decremented by 1, so its new upper bound is `(n - mid) // 2 - 2` if `s[right - 1]` is not '0', and `(n - mid) // 2 - 1` otherwise. The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, so it is one more than its original value.
