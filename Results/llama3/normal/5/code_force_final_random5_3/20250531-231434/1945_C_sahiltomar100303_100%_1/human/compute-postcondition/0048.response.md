Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 0, n is an integer between 5 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and must be greater than 2, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is n, rightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s plus one if s[left - 1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, trightZero is the number of zeros in the second half of s plus one if s[left - 1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, rightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s and must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, trightOne is the number of ones in the second half of s, left is n // 2 - 2, leftMove is 0, leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2 minus one if s[left - 1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, leftZero must be less than (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, leftOne is one less than its original value, rightOne is one more than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, still an integer between 5 and 3*10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 2. The string `s` remains the same, consisting only of 0 and 1, with a length of `n`. The value of `mid` remains unchanged, still equal to `n // 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, still equal to `n`. The values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` remain unchanged, still representing the number of zeros in the second half of `s` plus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise remaining the same. The value of `rightOne` is now one more than its original value, still representing the number of ones in the second half of `s` but now increased by one. The value of `trightOne` remains unchanged, still representing the number of ones in the second half of `s`. The value of `left` remains unchanged, still equal to `n // 2 - 2`. The value of `leftMove` remains unchanged, still equal to 0. The value of `leftZero` remains unchanged, still less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus one if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise remaining the same. The value of `leftOne` is now one less than its original value. The constraint that `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2` remains valid.
