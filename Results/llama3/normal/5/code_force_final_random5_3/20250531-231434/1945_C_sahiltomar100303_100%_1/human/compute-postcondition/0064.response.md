Output State: **`right` is less than or equal to `n`, `left` is the minimum value between `n // 2` and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value, `trightZero` is one less than its original value, and all other variables remain unchanged. If the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is the number of zeros in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of zeros in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of ones in the second half of `s` minus one, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value, and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and its relationship with `n` has changed to less than or equal to. The value of `left` remains the same, which is the minimum value between `n // 2` and the number of iterations it took for the condition to become false. The values of `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftMove`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` depend on the character at the new index `right` in string `s`. If the character is '0', then `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated accordingly. If the character is not '0', then `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftMove`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are updated accordingly.
