Postcondition: ***left is not equal to 0, leftZero is less than or equal to right // 2, rightZero is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2, leftOne is less than or equal to right // 2, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - right + 1) // 2, and right is not equal to n. The value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the sequence (n+1)//2.***
