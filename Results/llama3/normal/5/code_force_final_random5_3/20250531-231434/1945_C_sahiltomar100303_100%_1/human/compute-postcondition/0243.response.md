Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and greater than mid + 1, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 0 and less than n, left and right are either 0 or n, t is greater than 0, i is equal to mid + 2, leftZero and tleftZero are equal to the number of '0's in the first half of s, leftOne and tleftOne are equal to the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightZero is two more than its original value, and trightZero is two more than its original value.**

The code increments `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` and `trightZero` were originally one more than their original values, they are now two more than their original values. The other variables remain unchanged.
