Postcondition: ***left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0's in the string s, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the string s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of s, and right (equal to mid) is less than n. If s[right] is '0', then leftZero is increased by 1 and rightZero is decreased by 1. If s[right] is not '0', then leftOne is increased by 1 and rightOne is decreased by 1.***
