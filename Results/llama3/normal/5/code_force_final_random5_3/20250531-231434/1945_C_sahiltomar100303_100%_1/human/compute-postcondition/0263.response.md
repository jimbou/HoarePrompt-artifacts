Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and sufficiently large to keep the conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` true. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `left` is one less than its original value, `leftZero` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value. Otherwise, `left` remains unchanged, `leftZero` remains unchanged, and `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `leftOne` is decremented by 1.**
