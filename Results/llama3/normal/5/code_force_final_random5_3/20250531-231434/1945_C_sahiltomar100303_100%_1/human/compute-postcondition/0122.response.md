Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is at least 3, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 2. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 1, tleftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 3, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is not '0', then leftOne is 3, rightOne is 0, tleftOne is 3, trightOne is 0, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0.**
