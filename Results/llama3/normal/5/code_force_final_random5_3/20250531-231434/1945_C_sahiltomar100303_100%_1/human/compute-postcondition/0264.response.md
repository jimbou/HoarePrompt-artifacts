Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `s` is a string allowing for a distribution where the second condition can be met, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and sufficiently large to keep the conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` true, and one less than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `t`, and `i` remains unchanged. The value of `left` is decremented by 1, and the conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` are still valid.
