Output State: **n is greater than 2, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is n - 1, left is mid - 1, leftMove is 0, leftZero is less than mid // 2 minus 1, rightOne is less than (n - mid + 2) // 2 plus 1**

The code modifies the values of `leftZero` and `rightOne`. The first line decrements `leftZero` by 1, making it less than `mid // 2 minus 1`. The second line increments `rightOne` by 1, making it less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2 plus 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
