Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is n divided by 2, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid, rightZero is incremented by 1, trightZero is incremented by 1, the character at index i of string s is '0'.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are the increments to `rightZero` and `trightZero`, each increased by 1. The character at index `i` of string `s` remains '0' as it was in the initial state.
