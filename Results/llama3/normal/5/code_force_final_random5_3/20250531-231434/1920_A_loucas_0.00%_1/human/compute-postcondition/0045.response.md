Output State: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `less`, `big`, `no`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now an integer from the input, and the value of `a` is also an integer from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
