Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is an empty list and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, and `num` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `a` are updated to the integers read from the input. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains two integers `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` contains one integer `a` and `big` is an empty list and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.
