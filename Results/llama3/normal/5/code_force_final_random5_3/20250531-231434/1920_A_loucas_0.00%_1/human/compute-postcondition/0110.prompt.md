Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer, big is an empty list, less is an empty list, i is either the minimum value in less or the value of i remains unchanged, loop is greater than 1, iterable is 2
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing one integer which is `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` which is `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 1, `less` is a list containing one or two integers which are `a` if `x` is 2 or has been 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` which is `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 2, and also contains the integer `a` if `x` is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 1, `less` is a list containing one or two integers which are `a` if `x` is 2 or has been 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list or contains one integer which is `a` if `x` is not 2, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` which is `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 2, and also contains the integer `a` if `x` is 2, and contains another integer `a` if `x` is not 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `x` is 1, `big` also contains the integer `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
