Output State: **loop is an integer greater than 0, iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop test cases, less is a list containing innerLoop integers, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be that the loop variable will still be an integer greater than 0, the iterable variable will still be 0, the stdin will contain multiple test cases minus the number of test cases equal to the value of the innerLoop variable, the less list will contain a number of integers equal to the value of the innerLoop variable, the big and no lists will be empty, the num variable will still be 0, the innerLoop variable will still be an integer, the iterable2 variable will be equal to the value of the innerLoop variable minus 1, and the x and a variables will be integers.
