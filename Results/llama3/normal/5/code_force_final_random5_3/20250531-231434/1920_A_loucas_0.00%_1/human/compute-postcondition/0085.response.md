To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `iterable2` and `innerLoop`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `innerLoop`. If `innerLoop` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` or the value of `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2**
