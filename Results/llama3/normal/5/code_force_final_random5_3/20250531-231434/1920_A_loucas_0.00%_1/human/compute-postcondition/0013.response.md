Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.***
