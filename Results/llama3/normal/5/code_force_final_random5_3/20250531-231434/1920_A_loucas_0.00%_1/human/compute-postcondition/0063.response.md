Output State: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains two integers from the input and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains two integers `a` that were input and `less` and `big` are empty lists.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 3, because two integers have been read from the input. The values of `x` and `a` have been updated to the two integers read from the input. The values of `big`, `less`, and `no` depend on the value of `x`, which is now an integer from the input.
