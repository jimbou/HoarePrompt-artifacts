Output State: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 1, and also contains the integer `a`, `less` is a list containing one or two integers which are `a` if `x` is 2 or has been 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` which is `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 2, and also contains the integer `a` if `x` is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `big` now contains an additional integer `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
