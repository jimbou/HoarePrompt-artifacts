Output State: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` contains the integer `a` that was input, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remains the same. The value of `x` and `a` remains the same as they were input from the user. The list `no` now contains the integer `a` that was input. The lists `less` and `big` remain empty. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2. The value of `x` is still not equal to 1 and not equal to 2.
