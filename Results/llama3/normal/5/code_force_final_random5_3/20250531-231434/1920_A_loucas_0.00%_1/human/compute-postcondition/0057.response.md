Output State: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains two integers from the input and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains the integer `a` that was input and `less` and `big` are empty lists.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The value of `x` and `a` also remain unchanged. However, the value of `big` changes. If `x` is 1, `big` now contains two integers from the input. If `x` is 2, the value of `big` remains unchanged. If `x` is not 1 or 2, the value of `big` also remains unchanged. The values of `less` and `no` remain unchanged in all cases.
