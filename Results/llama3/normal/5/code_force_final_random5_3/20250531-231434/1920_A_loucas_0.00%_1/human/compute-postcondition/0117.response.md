Postcondition: ***num is either 0 or the minimum value in less, innerLoop is equal to iterable2 plus 1, x is either 1 or 2, a is an integer, big is a list containing all the integers a if x is 1, less is a list containing all the integers a if x is 2 and is not empty, i is the minimum value in less plus 1, loop is greater than 1, iterable is 2, no is a list containing all the integers a if x is not 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop. If i is not in no, then num is the minimum value in less plus 1.***
