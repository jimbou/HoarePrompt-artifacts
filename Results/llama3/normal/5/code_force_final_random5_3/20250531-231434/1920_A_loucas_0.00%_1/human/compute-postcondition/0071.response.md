Postcondition: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, the maximum value in `big` is less than the minimum value in `less`, `i` is the minimum value in `less`, and the current value of `i` is not in `no`.**
