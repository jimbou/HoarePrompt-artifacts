Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is an empty list and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, `x`, and `a` remain the same. The value of `less` is updated to include the value of `a`. The values of `big` and `no` depend on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains one integer `a` and `less` contains one integer `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` contains two integers. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` contains one integer `a` and `no` contains one integer `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
