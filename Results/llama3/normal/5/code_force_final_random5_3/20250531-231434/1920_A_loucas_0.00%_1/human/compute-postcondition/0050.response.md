Output State: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `less` is a list containing one integer, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input and its current value is 2, `a` is an integer from the input and `x` is not equal to 1**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `less` now contains one integer, which is the value of `a` that was appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `a` is still an integer from the input, and `x` is still 2 and not equal to 1.
