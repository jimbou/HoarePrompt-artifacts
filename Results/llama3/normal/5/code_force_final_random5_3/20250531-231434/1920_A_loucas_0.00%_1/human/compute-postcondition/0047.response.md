Output State: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` contains an integer from the input, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is 1, and `a` is an integer from the input.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to contain an integer from the input, which was previously empty. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 1, as one input has been consumed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
