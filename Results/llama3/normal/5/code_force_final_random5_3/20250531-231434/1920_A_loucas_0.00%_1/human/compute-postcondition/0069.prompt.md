Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is 1, iterable is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 or 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from the input and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains the integer `a` that was input and `less` and `big` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains two integers from the input and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains two integers `a` that were input and `less` and `big` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains three integers from the input and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains two integers `a` that were input and `less` and `big` are empty lists. If `x` is 1, `big` contains two integers from the input and `less` contains one integer from the input and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing three integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains two integers `a` that were input and `less` contains one integer from the input and `big` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
