This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers. It categorizes the integers into three lists based on their values and then finds the smallest integer that is not in the third list and is within the range of the maximum value in the first list and the minimum value in the second list. If such an integer is found, it prints the value; otherwise, it prints 0. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
