Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to include the integer `a` when `x` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The lists `less` and `no` remain empty when `x` is 1, and their values are unchanged when `x` is 2 or neither 1 nor 2.
