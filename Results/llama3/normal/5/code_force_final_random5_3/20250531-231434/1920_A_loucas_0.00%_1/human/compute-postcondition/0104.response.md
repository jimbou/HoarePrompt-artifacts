Output State: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 1, `less` is a list containing one or two integers which are `a` if `x` is 2 or has been 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` which is `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 2, and also contains the integer `a` if `x` is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `a` have been updated to the new integers read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged, but their values are still dependent on the new values of `x` and `a`. The stdin now contains one less test case.
