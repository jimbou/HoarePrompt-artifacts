Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer and equals 2, `a` is an integer, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing one integer which is `a`, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` which is `a` or the value of `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `less` has been updated to include the integer `a`. The value of `i` is either the minimum value in `less`, which is `a`, or remains unchanged. All other variables retain their original values.
