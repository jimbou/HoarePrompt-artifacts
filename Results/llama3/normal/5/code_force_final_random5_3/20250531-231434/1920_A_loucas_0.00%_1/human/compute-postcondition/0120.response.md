Postcondition: ***`num` is either 0 or the minimum value in `less` plus 2, `innerLoop` is equal to `iterable2` plus 1, `x` is either 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is 1 and `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, `less` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is 2 and is not empty and `min(less)` is greater than `i`, `i` is the minimum value in `less` plus 2, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is not 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is the minimum value in `less` plus 2, otherwise `num` remains 0.***
