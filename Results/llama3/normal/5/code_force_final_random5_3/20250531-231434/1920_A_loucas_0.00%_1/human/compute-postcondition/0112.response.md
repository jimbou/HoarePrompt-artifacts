Postcondition: ***`num` is 0, `innerLoop` is equal to `iterable2` plus 1, `x` is either 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is 1, `less` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is 2 and is not empty, `i` is the minimum value in `less`, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is not 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`. The current value of `i` is not in `no`.***
