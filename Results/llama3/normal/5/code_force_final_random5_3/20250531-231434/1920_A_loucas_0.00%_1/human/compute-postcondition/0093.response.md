Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `a` is an integer, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` or the value of `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

In this output state, the code has appended the integer `a` to the list `no`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2. The list `no` now contains the integer `a`, in addition to any previous elements it may have had.
