Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is 1, iterable is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer. If x is 1, big contains innerLoop integers from the input and less and no are empty lists. If x is 2, less is a list containing innerLoop integers and big and no are empty lists. If x is not 1 or 2, no contains innerLoop integers a that were input and less and big are empty lists. If x is 1, big contains innerLoop - 1 integers from the input and less contains one integer from the input and no is an empty list. If x is 2, less is a list containing innerLoop - 1 integers and big contains one integer from the input and no is an empty list. If x is not 1 or 2, no contains innerLoop - 1 integers a that were input and less contains one integer from the input and big is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *loop is 1, iterable is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, num is either 0 or the minimum value in less, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer, big is a non-empty list, less is a non-empty list, the maximum value in big is less than the minimum value in less, i is either the minimum value in less or the value of i remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *loop is 1, iterable is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, num is either 0 or the minimum value in less, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer, big is a non-empty list, less is a non-empty list, the maximum value in big is less than the minimum value in less, i is either the minimum value in less or the value of i remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is either 0 or the minimum value in `less`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, the maximum value in `big` is less than the minimum value in `less`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is set to `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
