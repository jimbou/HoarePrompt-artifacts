Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is an integer greater than 0, iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is an empty list and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing three integers `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing three integers if `x` is 2 in the if part, otherwise `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is a list containing two integers `a` if `x` is not 1 or 2 in the if part, otherwise `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` is a list containing two integers `a` if `x` is not 1 or 2 in the else part, otherwise `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
