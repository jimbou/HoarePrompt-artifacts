Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` or the value of `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2**

The code assigns the values of `x` and `a` to the integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, and after reading one test case, it now contains multiple test cases minus 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
