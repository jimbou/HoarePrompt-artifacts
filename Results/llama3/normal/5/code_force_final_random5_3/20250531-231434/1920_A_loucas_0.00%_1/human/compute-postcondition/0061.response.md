Postcondition: ***`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains two integers from the input and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains two integers `a` that were input and `less` and `big` are empty lists.***
