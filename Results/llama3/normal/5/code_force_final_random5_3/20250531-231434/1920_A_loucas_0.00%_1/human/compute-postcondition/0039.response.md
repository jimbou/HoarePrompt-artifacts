Output State: **loop is 0, iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop test cases, less is a list containing innerLoop integers, big is a list that must have at least one element, no is an empty list, num is equal to the last value of i if i is not in no, otherwise num remains 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable is 0, the iterable variable is 0, the stdin contains multiple test cases minus the innerLoop test cases, the less list contains innerLoop integers, the big list has at least one element, the no list is empty, the num variable is equal to the last value of i if i is not in the no list, otherwise it remains 0, the innerLoop variable is an integer, the iterable2 variable is innerLoop - 1, and the x and a variables are integers.
