Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing three integers if `x` is 2 in the if part, otherwise `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is a list containing two integers `a` if `x` is not 1 or 2 in the if part, otherwise `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is an empty list and `no` is a list containing two integers `a` if `x` is not 1 or 2 in the else part, otherwise `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.***
