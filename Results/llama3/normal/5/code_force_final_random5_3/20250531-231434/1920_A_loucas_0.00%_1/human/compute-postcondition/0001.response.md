The only variable in the loop head is variable `iterable` and `loop`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop`. If loop is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, loop is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `loop` is greater than 0 and iterable is now 0. 
State: **loop is an integer greater than 0, iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9)**
