Output State: **loop is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable loop is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 2 and 100 inclusive. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now contains n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x, where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
