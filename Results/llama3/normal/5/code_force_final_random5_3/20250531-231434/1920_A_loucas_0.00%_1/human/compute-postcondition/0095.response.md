Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing one integer which is `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` which is `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, and `no` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 2.***
