Output State: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from the input and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains the integer `a` that was input and `less` and `big` are empty lists.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2, since two integers have been read from the input. The values of `x` and `a` have been updated to the integers read from the input. The values of `big`, `less`, and `no` depend on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from the input, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains the integer `a` that was input, and `less` and `big` are empty lists.
