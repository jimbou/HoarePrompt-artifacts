Output State: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing one or two integers which are `a` if `x` is 2 or has been 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` which is `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `less` has been updated to include the integer `a` regardless of the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `less` now contains one or two integers, which are `a` if `x` is 2 or has been 2, otherwise it is an empty list. The value of `i` is either the minimum value in `less`, which is `a` if `x` is 2, or it remains unchanged.
