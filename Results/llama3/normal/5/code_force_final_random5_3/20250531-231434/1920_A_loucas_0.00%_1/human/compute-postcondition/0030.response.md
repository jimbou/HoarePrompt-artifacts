Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` test cases, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers that must have at least one element greater than the maximum value in `big`, `big` is a list that must have at least one element, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. The current value of `i` is not in the list `no`.***
