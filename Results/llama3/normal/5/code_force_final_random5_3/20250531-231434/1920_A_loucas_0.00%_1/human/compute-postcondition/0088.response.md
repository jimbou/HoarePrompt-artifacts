Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is an integer, `big` contains the integer `a`, `less` is an empty list, `i` is either the minimum value in `less` or the value of `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2**

The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an integer, `big` now contains this integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
