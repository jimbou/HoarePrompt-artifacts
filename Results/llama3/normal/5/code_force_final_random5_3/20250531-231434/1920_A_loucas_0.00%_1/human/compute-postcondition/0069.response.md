Output State: **loop is 1, iterable is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer. If x is 1, big contains innerLoop integers from the input and less and no are empty lists. If x is 2, less is a list containing innerLoop integers and big and no are empty lists. If x is not 1 or 2, no contains innerLoop integers a that were input and less and big are empty lists. If x is 1, big contains innerLoop - 1 integers from the input and less contains one integer from the input and no is an empty list. If x is 2, less is a list containing innerLoop - 1 integers and big contains one integer from the input and no is an empty list. If x is not 1 or 2, no contains innerLoop - 1 integers a that were input and less contains one integer from the input and big is an empty list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable remains 1, the iterable variable remains 1, the stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of iterations, the num variable remains 0, and the innerLoop variable remains an integer. The iterable2 variable is set to innerLoop - 1, and the x and a variables are set to integers from the input. The big, less, and no lists are populated based on the values of x and a. If x is 1, the big list contains innerLoop integers from the input, and the less and no lists are empty. If x is 2, the less list contains innerLoop integers, and the big and no lists are empty. If x is not 1 or 2, the no list contains innerLoop integers a that were input, and the less and big lists are empty. Additionally, if x is 1, the big list contains innerLoop - 1 integers from the input, and the less list contains one integer from the input, and the no list is empty. If x is 2, the less list contains innerLoop - 1 integers, and the big list contains one integer from the input, and the no list is empty. If x is not 1 or 2, the no list contains innerLoop - 1 integers a that were input, and the less list contains one integer from the input, and the big list is empty.
