To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `big` and `less`. The loop will execute if `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`. Since `big` is an empty list, `max(big)` will be undefined, so we need to adjust `big` to have at least one element. Similarly, since `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers, we need to adjust `less` to have at least one element that is greater than the maximum value in `big`.

State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` test cases, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers that must have at least one element greater than the maximum value in `big`, `big` is a list that must have at least one element, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer**
