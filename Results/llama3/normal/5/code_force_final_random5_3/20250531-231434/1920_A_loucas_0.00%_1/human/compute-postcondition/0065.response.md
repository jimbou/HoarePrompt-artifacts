Output State: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains two integers from the input and `less` contains one integer from the input and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing three integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains two integers `a` that were input and `less` contains one integer from the input and `big` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The value of `x` and `a` also remains unchanged. However, the list `less` now contains one more integer from the input. The contents of `big` and `no` depend on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` still contains two integers from the input, and `less` now contains one integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `less` now contains three integers. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` still contains two integers from the input, and `less` now contains one integer from the input.
