Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is equal to `iterable2` plus 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is 1, `less` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is 2, `i` is the minimum value in `less` if `less` is not empty, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is not 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *num is either 0 or the minimum value in less, innerLoop is equal to iterable2 plus 1, x is either 1 or 2, a is an integer, big is a list containing all the integers a if x is 1, less is a list containing all the integers a if x is 2 and is not empty, i is the minimum value in less, loop is greater than 1, iterable is 2, no is a list containing all the integers a if x is not 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *num is either 0 or the minimum value in less, innerLoop is equal to iterable2 plus 1, x is either 1 or 2, a is an integer, big is a list containing all the integers a if x is 1, less is a list containing all the integers a if x is 2 and is not empty, i is the minimum value in less plus 1, loop is greater than 1, iterable is 2, no is a list containing all the integers a if x is not 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop. If i is not in no, then num is the minimum value in less plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`num` is either 0 or the minimum value in `less` plus 2, `innerLoop` is equal to `iterable2` plus 1, `x` is either 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is 1 and `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, `less` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is 2 and is not empty and `min(less)` is greater than `i`, `i` is the minimum value in `less` plus 2, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing all the integers `a` if `x` is not 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is the minimum value in `less` plus 2, otherwise `num` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
