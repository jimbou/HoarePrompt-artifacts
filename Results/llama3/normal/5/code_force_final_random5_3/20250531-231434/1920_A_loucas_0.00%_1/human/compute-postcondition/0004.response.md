Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer**

The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `a`. Since `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, after reading two integers, `stdin` now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
