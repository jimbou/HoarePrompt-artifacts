To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `big`, and `less`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the minimum value in `less`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `big` has at least one element, and `less` has at least one element greater than the maximum value in `big`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, and `less` must still have at least one element greater than the maximum value in `big`. Since `big` is not modified in the loop head, its state remains the same.

State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` test cases, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers that must have at least one element greater than the maximum value in `big`, `big` is a list that must have at least one element, `no` is an empty list, `num` is equal to `i + 1` if `i + 1` is not in `no`, otherwise `num` remains 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is `i + 2`.**
