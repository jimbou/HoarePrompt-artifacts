Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the number of valid integers:

`for i in range(max(big), min(less)): if i not in no: num = i break`

This line only finds the first valid integer and assigns it to `num`, but it does not count the total number of valid integers. Instead, it should count all integers in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that are not in the `no` list.

A correct implementation would be:

`num = sum(1 for i in range(max(big), min(less)+1) if i not in no)`

This line correctly counts the total number of valid integers by summing up all integers in the range that are not in the `no` list.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid integers.
