Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
        if i not in no:
            num = i
            break
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: loop is 0, iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop test cases, less is a list containing innerLoop integers, big is a list that must have at least one element, no is an empty list, num is equal to the last value of i if i is not in no, otherwise num remains 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer, and the value of num is being printed, where num is either the last value of i if i is not in the empty list no, or 0 if i is in the empty list no

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: loop is 1, iterable is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, num is either 0 or the minimum value in less, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer, big is a non-empty list, less is a non-empty list, the maximum value in big is less than the minimum value in less, i is either the minimum value in less or the value of i remains unchanged, and the value of num which is either 0 or the minimum value in less is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: num is either 0 or the minimum value in less plus the number of iterations of the loop, innerLoop is equal to iterable2 plus 1, x is either 1 or 2, a is an integer, big is a list containing all the integers a if x is 1 and max(big) is less than min(less), less is a list containing all the integers a if x is 2 and is not empty and min(less) is greater than i, i is the minimum value in less plus the number of iterations of the loop, loop is greater than 1, iterable is 2, no is a list containing all the integers a if x is not 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop. If i is not in no, then num is the minimum value in less plus the number of iterations of the loop, otherwise num remains 0, and the value of num is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
