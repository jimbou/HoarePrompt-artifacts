Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer with a current value of 1, and `a` is an integer.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `big` now contains one integer, which is the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
