Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing two integers `a`.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `no` is updated to include the integer `a`. The conditions for the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are also updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains one integer `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains one integer, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` contains two integers `a`.
