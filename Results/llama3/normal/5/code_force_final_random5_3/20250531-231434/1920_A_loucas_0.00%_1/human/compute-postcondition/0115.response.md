To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `big`, and `less`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the minimum value in `less`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the minimum value in `less`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be increased by 1.

The state of `big` and `less` does not need to be adjusted because they are not used to determine whether the loop can execute again.

State: **`num` is either 0 or the minimum value in less, `innerLoop` is equal to iterable2 plus 1, `x` is either 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list containing all the integers a if x is 1, `less` is a list containing all the integers a if x is 2 and is not empty, `i` is the minimum value in less plus 1, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `no` is a list containing all the integers a if x is not 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop.**
