To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `iterable2` and `innerLoop`. The loop will execute if `innerLoop` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `innerLoop` to be greater than 0, and `iterable2` should be 0, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0**
