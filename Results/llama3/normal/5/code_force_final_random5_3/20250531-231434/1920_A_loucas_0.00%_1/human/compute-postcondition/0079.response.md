Postcondition: ***`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is either 0 or the minimum value in `less`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, the maximum value in `big` is less than the minimum value in `less`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is set to `i`.***
