Output State: **`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from the input and `less` and `no` are empty lists but now `no` contains the integer `a` that was input. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer and `big` and `no` are empty lists but now `no` contains the integer `a` that was input. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains the integer `a` that was input and `less` and `big` are empty lists but now `no` contains another integer `a` that was input.**

In natural language, the code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`, regardless of the value of `x`. This means that if `x` is 1, `no` will now contain the integer `a` that was input, in addition to the integer that was already in `big`. If `x` is 2, `no` will now contain the integer `a` that was input, in addition to the integer that was already in `less`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` will now contain another integer `a` that was input. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
