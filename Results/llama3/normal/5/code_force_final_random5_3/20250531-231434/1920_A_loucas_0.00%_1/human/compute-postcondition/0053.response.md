Postcondition: ***`loop` is 1, `iterable` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, and `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 2, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, and `no` contains the integer `a` that was input.***
