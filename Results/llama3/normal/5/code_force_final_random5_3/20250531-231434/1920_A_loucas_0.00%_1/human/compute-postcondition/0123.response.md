Output: **num is either 0 or the minimum value in less plus the number of iterations of the loop, innerLoop is equal to iterable2 plus 1, x is either 1 or 2, a is an integer, big is a list containing all the integers a if x is 1 and max(big) is less than min(less), less is a list containing all the integers a if x is 2 and is not empty and min(less) is greater than i, i is the minimum value in less plus the number of iterations of the loop, loop is greater than 1, iterable is 2, no is a list containing all the integers a if x is not 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop. If i is not in no, then num is the minimum value in less plus the number of iterations of the loop, otherwise num remains 0, and the value of num is being printed**
