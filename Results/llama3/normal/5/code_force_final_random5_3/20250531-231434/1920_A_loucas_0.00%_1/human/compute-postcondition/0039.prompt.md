Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is an integer greater than 0, iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop test cases, less is a list containing innerLoop integers, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *loop is an integer greater than 0, iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop test cases, less is a list containing innerLoop integers that must have at least one element greater than the maximum value in big, big is a list that must have at least one element, no is an empty list, num is equal to the current value of i if i is not in no, otherwise num remains 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x is an integer, a is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` test cases, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers that must have at least one element greater than the maximum value in `big`, `big` is a list that must have at least one element, `no` is an empty list, `num` is equal to `i` if `i` is not in `no`, otherwise `num` remains 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` test cases, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers that must have at least one element greater than the maximum value in `big`, `big` is a list that must have at least one element, `no` is an empty list, `num` is equal to `i` if `i` is not in `no`, otherwise `num` remains 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `i` is either `i + 2` if `i` is not in `no`, or remains unchanged if `i` is in `no`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
