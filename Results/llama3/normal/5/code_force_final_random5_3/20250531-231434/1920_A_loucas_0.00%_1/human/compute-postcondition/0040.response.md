The code prints the value of `num`, which is equal to the last value of `i` if `i` is not in the list `no`, otherwise `num` remains 0. Since `no` is an empty list, `num` will be equal to the last value of `i`. However, the exact value of `i` is not provided in the precondition, so we can't determine the exact numerical value of `num`.

Output: **the last value of i (where i is not in the empty list no)**
