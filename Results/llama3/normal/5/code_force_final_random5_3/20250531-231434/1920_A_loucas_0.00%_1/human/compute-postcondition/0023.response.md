Output State: **`loop` is an integer greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing three integers `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing two integers and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` is a list containing one integer `a` and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` now contains three integers `a`. If `x` is 2, the value of `big` remains unchanged. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `big` now contains one integer `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
