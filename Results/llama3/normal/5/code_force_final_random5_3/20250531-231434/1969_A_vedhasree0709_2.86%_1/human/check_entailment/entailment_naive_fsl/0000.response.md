Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
3 4 1 2

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2. The friends 1 and 2 can be invited, and both will come to the party.

The program only checks for a specific pattern in the input list, and if it doesn't find it, it prints 3. However, this is not a correct solution for all possible inputs. The program should find the minimum number of invitations needed to invite at least 2 friends, regardless of the pattern in the input list.

A correct solution would involve finding the minimum number of invitations needed to create at least one pair of friends who can come to the party. This can be done by iterating over the list and finding the minimum number of invitations needed to create a pair.
