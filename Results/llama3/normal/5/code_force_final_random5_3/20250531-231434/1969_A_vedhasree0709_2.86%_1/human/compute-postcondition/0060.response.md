Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers read from stdin. If the first two elements of `l` are equal to 2 and 1 respectively, then `i` is 1, `j` is 1 and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and no changes are made to `j`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains the same, and the list `l` is still a list of integers read from stdin. However, the value of `i` has changed. If the first two elements of `l` are equal to 2 and 1 respectively, then `i` is now 1 (previously it was 0), and `j` remains 1. The number 2 is still printed. If the first two elements of `l` are not equal to 2 and 1 respectively, then `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, and `j` remains unchanged.
