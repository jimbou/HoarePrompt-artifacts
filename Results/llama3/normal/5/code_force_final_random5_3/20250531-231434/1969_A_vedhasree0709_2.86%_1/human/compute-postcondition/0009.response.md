According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000. `n` being between 1 and 5000 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If the current value of `l[0]` is equal to 2 and the current value of `l[1]` is equal to 1, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
