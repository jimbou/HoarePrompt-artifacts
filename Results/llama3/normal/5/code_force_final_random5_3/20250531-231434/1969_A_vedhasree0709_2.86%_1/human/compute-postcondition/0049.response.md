Based on the initial state, the code snippet contains a simple print statement that prints the integer value 3.

The initial state describes various variables and conditions, but none of them affect the print statement. The print statement is a standalone instruction that outputs the value 3, regardless of the values of n, l, i, j, or any other variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the integer value 3.

Output: **3**
