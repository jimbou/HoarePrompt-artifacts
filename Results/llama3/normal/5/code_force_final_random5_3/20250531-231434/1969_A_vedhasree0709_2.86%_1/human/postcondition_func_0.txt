This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. For each test case, it checks if a list of distinct integers contains two consecutive elements that are in reverse order (i.e., `i + 2` followed by `i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function iterates through all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
