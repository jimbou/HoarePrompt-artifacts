Output: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `l` is a list of integers read from stdin. If the first two elements of `l` are equal to 2 and 1 respectively, then `i` is increased by 2, `j` is 1, and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 2 and no changes are made to `j`, and the number 2 is printed**
