Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If the current value of `l[i]` is equal to `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
