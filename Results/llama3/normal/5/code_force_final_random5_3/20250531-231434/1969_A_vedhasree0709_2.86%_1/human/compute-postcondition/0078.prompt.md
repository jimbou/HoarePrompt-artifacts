Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i <= n - 1:
        if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
            print(2)
            j = 1
            break
        i += 1
    if j == 0:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 5000, l is a list of integers, i is n, _ is 0, stdin is empty. If there exists an index k such that l[k] equals k + 2 and l[k + 1] equals k + 1, then the number 2 was printed and j is 1. Otherwise, if j is 0, the number 3 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, l is a list of integers, i is equal to n, j is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty. If j is 0, the number 3 is printed and there is no i such that l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1. If j is 1, the number 2 is printed and there is an i such that l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n`, `j` is 1 if `l` contains two consecutive elements `i + 2` and `i + 1` for any `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, otherwise `j` is 0. If `j` is 0, the number 3 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
