Output State: **n is greater than 1, l is a list of integers, i is 1, j is 1, and the number 2 is printed**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `l` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains 1 as it is not modified by the code. The value of `j` is set to 1 by the first line of the code, and since `j` is 1, the number 2 is printed. The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables.
