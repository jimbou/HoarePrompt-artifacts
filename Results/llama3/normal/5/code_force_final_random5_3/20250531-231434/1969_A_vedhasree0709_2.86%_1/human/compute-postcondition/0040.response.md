The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition that `l[1]` equals 3 and `l[2]` equals 2 is still valid, so `j` is still 1 and the number 2 is still printed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and the number 2 is printed.**
