Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If the current value of `l[0]` is equal to 2 and the current value of `l[1]` is equal to 1, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that determines the value of `j` is still valid, but now it refers to the values of `l[0]` and `l[1]` instead of `l[i]` and `l[i + 1]`.
