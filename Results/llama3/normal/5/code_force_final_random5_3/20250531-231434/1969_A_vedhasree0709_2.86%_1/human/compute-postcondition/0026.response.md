The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the value returned by `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If the value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value returned by `int(input())` is unknown, but `_` is 0. For the loop to execute again, the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` must be 1.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000, l is a list of integers, i is n, _ is 1, stdin is not empty**
