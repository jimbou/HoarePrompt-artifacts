Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 1 if `l` contains two consecutive elements `i + 2` and `i + 1` for any `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, otherwise `j` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`. The value of `j` will be 1 if the list `l` contains two consecutive elements `i + 2` and `i + 1` for any `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`. If no such pair is found, the value of `j` will be 0.
