Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000, l is a list of integers, i is 0, j is 1, _ is 0, stdin is empty, the current value of l[i] is equal to i + 2, the current value of l[i + 1] is equal to i + 1, and the number 2 is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains integers, with `l[i]` equal to `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equal to `i + 1`. The number 2 is still being printed. The break statement does not affect any variables, so the state of the program remains the same except for the updated value of `j`.
