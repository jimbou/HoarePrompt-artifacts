Postcondition: ***n is an integer, l is a list of integers, i is equal to n, j is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty. If j is 0, the number 3 is printed and there is no i such that l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1. If j is 1, the number 2 is printed and there is an i such that l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1.***
