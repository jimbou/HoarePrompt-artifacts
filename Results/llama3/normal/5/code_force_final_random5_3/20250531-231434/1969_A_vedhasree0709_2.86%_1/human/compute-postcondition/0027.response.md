Output State: **n is an integer, l is a list of integers, i is 0, j is 0, stdin is empty**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, replacing its original value. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`, replacing its original value. The third and fourth lines assign 0 to `i` and `j`, respectively. Since the code reads from stdin twice, it is now empty. The variable `_` is not affected by the code and remains 1.
