The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition that determines the value of `j` is still valid, so if the current value of `l[i]` is equal to `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is equal to `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the number 2 is printed. However, since `i` is now 1, this condition is now checking `l[1]` and `l[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0 or 1 depending on the values of `l[1]` and `l[2]`, and if `j` is 1, the number 2 is printed, stdin is empty.**
