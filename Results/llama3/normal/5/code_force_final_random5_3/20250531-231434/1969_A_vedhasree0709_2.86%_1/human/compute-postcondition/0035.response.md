According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. `n` being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0 or 1 depending on the values of `l[1]` and `l[2]`, and if `j` is 1, the number 2 is printed, stdin is empty.**
