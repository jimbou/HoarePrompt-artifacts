Output: **`n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If the current value of `l[0]` is equal to 2 and the current value of `l[1]` is equal to 1, then `j` is 1 and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `j` remains 0, and the number 2 is printed**
