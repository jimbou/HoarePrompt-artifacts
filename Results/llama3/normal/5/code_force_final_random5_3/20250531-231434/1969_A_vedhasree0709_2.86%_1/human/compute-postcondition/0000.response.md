To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `int(input())` represents the number of test cases `t`, we can adjust the state to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
