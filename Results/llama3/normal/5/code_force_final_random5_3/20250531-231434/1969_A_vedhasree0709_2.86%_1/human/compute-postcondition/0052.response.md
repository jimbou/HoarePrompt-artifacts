To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not used in the loop body. The loop condition is `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the standard input.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer
* `l` is a list of integers
* `i` is equal to `n`
* `j` is either 0 or 1
* `stdin` is empty

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The loop will execute again if there is another integer to read from the standard input.
* The value of `n` is not relevant to the loop condition.
* The value of `l` is not relevant to the loop condition.
* The value of `i` is not relevant to the loop condition.
* The value of `j` is not relevant to the loop condition.

Since the loop condition is `int(input())`, we need to consider the state of the standard input. At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, there must be another integer to read from the standard input.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` is not empty and contains at least one integer**

Note that we cannot determine the exact value of `j` or the contents of `l` at the start of the next iteration, as they are not relevant to the loop condition.
