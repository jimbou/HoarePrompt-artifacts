To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `i <= n - 1`.

Given that `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `0 <= n - 1`, which further simplifies to `n >= 1`.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers read from stdin, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
