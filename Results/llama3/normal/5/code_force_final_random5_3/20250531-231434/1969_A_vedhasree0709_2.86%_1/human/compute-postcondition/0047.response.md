Output State: **n is an integer, l is a list of integers, i is n, j is 1 if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1 for some i, otherwise j is 0, stdin is empty, and the number 2 is printed if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1 for some i.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `l` remains unchanged, the value of `i` is equal to `n`, the value of `j` is 1 if the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met for some `i`, otherwise `j` is 0, the standard input `stdin` remains empty, and the number 2 is printed if the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met for some `i`.
