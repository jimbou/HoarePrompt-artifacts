Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 1 if `l` contains two consecutive elements `i + 2` and `i + 1` for any `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, otherwise `j` is 0. If `j` is 0, the number 3 is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is 1 if the list `l` contains two consecutive elements `i + 2` and `i + 1` for any `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, otherwise `j` is 0. If `j` is 0, the number 3 is printed.
