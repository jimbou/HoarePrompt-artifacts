To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure that `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 2. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
