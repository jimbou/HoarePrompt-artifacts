Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `l` is a list of integers read from stdin. If the first two elements of `l` are equal to `i + 3` and `i + 2` respectively, then `j` is 1, and the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been increased by 1, and the condition for `j` and the print statement remains the same but with the updated value of `i`. The value of `n` is still greater than `i + 1`, but now it is also greater than `i + 2` since `i` has been increased by 1. The list `l` remains the same as it was read from stdin before the code execution.
