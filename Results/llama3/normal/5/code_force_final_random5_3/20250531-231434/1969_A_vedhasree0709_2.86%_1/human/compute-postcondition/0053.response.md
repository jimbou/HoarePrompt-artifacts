The code snippet consists of four lines, each affecting the variables in the initial state. Here's the combined effect of all lines:

1. `n = int(input())`: This line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `stdin` contains at least one integer, `n` will be updated with this value. The previous value of `n` is discarded.

2. `l = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`. Since `stdin` contains at least one integer, `l` will be updated with this list of integers. The previous value of `l` is discarded.

3. `i = 0`: This line assigns the value 0 to `i`, overwriting its previous value, which was equal to `n`.

4. `j = 0`: This line assigns the value 0 to `j`, overwriting its previous value, which was either 0 or 1.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is:

* `n` is an integer, but its value is now the integer read from `stdin`.
* `l` is a list of integers, but its value is now the list of integers read from `stdin`.
* `i` is 0.
* `j` is 0.

Note that the values of `n` and `l` are updated based on the input from `stdin`, but their types remain the same (integer and list of integers, respectively).

Output State: **n is an integer read from stdin, l is a list of integers read from stdin, i is 0, j is 0**
