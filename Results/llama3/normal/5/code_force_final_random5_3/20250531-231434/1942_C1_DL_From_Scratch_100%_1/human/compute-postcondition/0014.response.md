Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 3, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2, `num` is the difference between the fourth and third elements of `list0` minus 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `list0` minus 1 is 1, then `count` is 3 if the difference between the fourth and third elements of `list0` minus 1 is 1, otherwise `count` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `list0` minus 1 is 1, then `count` is now 3. Otherwise, `count` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
