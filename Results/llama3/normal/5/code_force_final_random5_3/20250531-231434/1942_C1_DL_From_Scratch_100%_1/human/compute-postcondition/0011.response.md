Postcondition: **T is at least 1, n is an integer, x is at least 3, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 1, num is the difference between the third and second elements of list0 minus 1. If the difference between the second and first elements of list0 minus 1 is 1, then count is 2 if num is 1, otherwise count is 1.**
