Output State: **T is at least 3, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, x is at least 3, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1, the current value of num is 1, which is equal to list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still at least 3, n is still an integer, y is still an integer, list0 is still a sorted list of integers, i is still x - 1, x is still at least 3, count has been incremented by 1, num is still 1, which is equal to list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1, and there is still no input in stdin.
