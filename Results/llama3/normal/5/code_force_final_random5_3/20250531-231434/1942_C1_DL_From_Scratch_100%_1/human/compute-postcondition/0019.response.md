Output State: **T is at least 1, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is x - 1, the current value of num is 1, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 whose difference minus 1 is 1 plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still at least 1, n is still an integer, y is still an integer, list0 is still a sorted list of integers, stdin still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is still x - 1, the current value of num is still 1, and count has been incremented by 1, so it is now the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 whose difference minus 1 is 1 plus 1.
