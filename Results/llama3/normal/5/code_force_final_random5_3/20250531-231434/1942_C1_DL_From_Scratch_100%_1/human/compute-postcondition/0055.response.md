Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 3, `num` is the difference between the third element of `list0` and the second element of `list0`, minus 1. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.***
