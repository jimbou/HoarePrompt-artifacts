Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. It first sorts the list of chosen vertices and then iterates through the list to count the number of triangular pieces that can be formed. The program also correctly handles the case where the first and last vertices are connected, forming a triangular piece.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the list of chosen vertices, counting the number of triangular pieces that can be formed, and adds the number of vertices minus 2 to the count, as each vertex can form a triangular piece with the two adjacent vertices.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
