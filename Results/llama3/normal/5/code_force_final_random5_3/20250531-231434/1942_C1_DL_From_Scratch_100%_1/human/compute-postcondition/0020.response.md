Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 whose difference minus 1 is 1. If the current value of num is 1, count is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
