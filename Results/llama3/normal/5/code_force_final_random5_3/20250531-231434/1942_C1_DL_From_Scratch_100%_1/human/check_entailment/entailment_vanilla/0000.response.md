Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n clockwise. The program is given a list of x vertices that can be used to form diagonals, and it needs to determine the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed.

The program first sorts the list of vertices in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the list and counts the number of pairs of adjacent vertices that have a difference of 1. This is because if two vertices have a difference of 1, they can form a diagonal that divides the polygon into two parts, and each part can be further divided into triangles.

The program also checks the difference between the first vertex and the last vertex, considering the polygon as a circular shape. If this difference is 1, it also counts as a pair of adjacent vertices that can form a diagonal.

Finally, the program adds the count of pairs of adjacent vertices to x - 2, where x is the number of vertices that can be used to form diagonals. This is because each pair of adjacent vertices can form a diagonal that divides the polygon into two parts, and each part can be further divided into triangles. The -2 is because the first and last vertices are already counted in the pairs.

The program prints the result, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

Correctness: **True**
