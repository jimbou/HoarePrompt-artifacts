Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the variable `T` has been assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been read and processed. The rest of the test cases remain in stdin, each consisting of two lines as described in the initial state.
