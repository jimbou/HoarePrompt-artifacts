#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: T is 0, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, x is at least 3, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2, if num is equal to 1, count is increased by 1, otherwise count remains the same, num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1, and stdin contains no input, and this is printed: count + x - 2 (where count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2, and x is at least 3)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then sorts these x integers and counts the number of pairs of adjacent elements that have a difference of 2. It also checks if the difference between the first element and the last element, considering the circular nature of the list (i.e., list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1), is 1, and if so, increments the count. Finally, the function prints the count plus x minus 2 for each test case.
