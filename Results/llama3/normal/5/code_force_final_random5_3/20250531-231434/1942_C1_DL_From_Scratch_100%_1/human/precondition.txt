stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the number of sides of the polygon (4 <= n <= 10^9), x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)), and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen (y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
