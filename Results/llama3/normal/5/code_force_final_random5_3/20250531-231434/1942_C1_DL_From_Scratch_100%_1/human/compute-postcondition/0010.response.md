Output State: **T is at least 1, n is an integer, x is at least 3, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 1, num is the difference between the third and second elements of list0 minus 1. If the difference between the second and first elements of list0 minus 1 is 1, then count is 2, else count is 1.**

In this output state, the value of count has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of count is now 2 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 minus 1 is 1, otherwise it is 1.
