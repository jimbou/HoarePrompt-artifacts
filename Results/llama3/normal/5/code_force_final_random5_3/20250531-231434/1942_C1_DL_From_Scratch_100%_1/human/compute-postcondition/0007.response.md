Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, n is an integer, x is at least 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 0. If the difference between the second and first elements of list0 minus 1 is 1, then count is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
