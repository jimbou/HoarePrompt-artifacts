Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `x` is at least 4, `num` is the difference between the fourth element of `list0` and the third element of `list0`, minus 1. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.***
