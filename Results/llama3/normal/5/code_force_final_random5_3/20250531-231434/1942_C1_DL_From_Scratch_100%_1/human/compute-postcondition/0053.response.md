Output State: **`T` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 3, `num` is the difference between the third element of `list0` and the second element of `list0`, minus 1, stdin contains no input. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be the difference between the third element of `list0` and the second element of `list0`, minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding `count` still applies, meaning that if the new value of `num` is 1, then `count` is 1.
