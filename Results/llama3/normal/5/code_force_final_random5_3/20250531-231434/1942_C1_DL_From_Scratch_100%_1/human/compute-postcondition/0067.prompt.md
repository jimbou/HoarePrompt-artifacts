Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is at least 1, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 whose difference minus 1 is 1. If the current value of num is 1, count is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. , and this is printed: count + x - 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is at least 2, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 whose difference minus 1 is 1. If num is 1, then count is increased by 1., and this is printed: count + x - 2 (where count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 whose difference minus 1 is 1, and x is an integer)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is at least 3, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, x is at least 3, count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2, if num is equal to 1, count is increased by 1, otherwise count remains the same, num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1, and stdin contains no input, and this is printed: count + x - 2 (where count is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in list0 that have a difference of 2, and x is at least 3)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
