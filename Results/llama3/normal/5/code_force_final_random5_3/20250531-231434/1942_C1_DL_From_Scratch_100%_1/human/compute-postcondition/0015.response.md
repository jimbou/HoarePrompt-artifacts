Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 3, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2, `num` is the difference between the fourth and third elements of `list0` minus 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `list0` minus 1 is 1, then if `num` is 1, `count` is 3, otherwise `count` is 2. If the difference between the third and second elements of `list0` minus 1 is not 1, then if `num` is 1, `count` is 2, otherwise `count` is 1.***
