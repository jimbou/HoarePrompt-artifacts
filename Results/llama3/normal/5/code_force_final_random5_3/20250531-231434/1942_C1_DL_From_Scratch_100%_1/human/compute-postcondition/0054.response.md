Output State: **`T` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 3, `num` is the difference between the third element of `list0` and the second element of `list0`, minus 1, `count` is either 1 or 2. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 2, else `count` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If `num` is 1, then `count` was initially 1 and is now 2. If `num` is not 1, then `count` was initially 0 (since it was only defined to be 1 if `num` is 1) and is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
