Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 0. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `list0` minus 1 is 1, then `count` is the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `list0` whose difference minus 1 is 1 plus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
