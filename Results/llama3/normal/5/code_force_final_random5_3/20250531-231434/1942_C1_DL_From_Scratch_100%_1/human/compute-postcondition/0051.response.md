Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 0, `x` is at least 2, `num` is the difference between the second element of `list0` and the first element of `list0`, minus 1, stdin contains no input. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
