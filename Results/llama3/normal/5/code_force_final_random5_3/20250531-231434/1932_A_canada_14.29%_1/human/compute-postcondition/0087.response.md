Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len+1` characters, `ret` is 1 if the first character in `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1 if the first character in `s` is not '*', otherwise `thorn` is 3 if the first character in `s` is '*', `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `_` is 2, `input()` must be greater than 1, the number of '@' characters in the list `s` which is `ret` is being printed, and `i` is the second character in `s`. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute normally.***
