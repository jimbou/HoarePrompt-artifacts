Postcondition: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 2 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*' and the program continues with the next iteration unless `thorn` is 2, in which case the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0.**
