Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0, `i` is the first character in the list, and `i` is not '@'. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution. If `i` is not '*', then `i` is not '*' and not '@'.***
