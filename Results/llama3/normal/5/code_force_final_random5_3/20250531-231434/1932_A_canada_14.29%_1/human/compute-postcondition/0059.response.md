Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains t-3 or t-4 test cases, `_` is 1, `input()` must be greater than 0. If the second character in the list `s` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 1. If the second character in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is 2 or 3. If `thorn` is 3, then `stdin` contains t-4 test cases and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the second character in the list `s` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1. If the second character in the list `s` is '@', then `thorn` is now 1. If the second character in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is now 2 or 3. If `thorn` is 3, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the second character in the list `s` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is now 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
