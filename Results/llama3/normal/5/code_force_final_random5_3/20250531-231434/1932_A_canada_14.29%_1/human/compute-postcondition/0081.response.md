Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `_` is 2, `input()` must be greater than 1, the number of '@' characters in the list `s` which is `ret` is being printed, `i` is the first character in `s`, and `i` is not equal to '@'. If the first character in `s` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. If the first character in `s` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0, and the program continues with the current state.***
