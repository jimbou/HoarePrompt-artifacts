Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `_` is 2, `input()` must be greater than 1, the number of '@' characters in the list `s` which is `ret` is being printed, the first character in `s` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, `_`, and the conditions on `stdin` and `input()` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
