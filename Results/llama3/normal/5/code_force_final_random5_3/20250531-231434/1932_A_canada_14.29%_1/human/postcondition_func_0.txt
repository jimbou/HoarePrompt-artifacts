This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer length followed by a string of that length. The string contains three types of characters: '.' (empty cell), '@' (cell with a coin), and '*' (cell with thorns). The function counts the number of '@' characters in each string, but stops counting if it encounters two '*' characters in a row. The function then prints the count of '@' characters for each test case.
