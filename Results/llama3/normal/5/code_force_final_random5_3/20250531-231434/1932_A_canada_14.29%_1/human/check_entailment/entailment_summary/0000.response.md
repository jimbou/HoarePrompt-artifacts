Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the maximum number of coins that can be collected in the path. The program iterates through the string representing the path, and for each character, it checks if it's a coin ('@'), a thorn ('*'), or an empty cell ('.'). If it's a coin, it increments the count. If it's a thorn, it increments a separate counter to keep track of consecutive thorns. If the thorn counter reaches 2, it breaks out of the loop, as it's not possible to move further. The program then prints the count of coins for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
