Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters, ret is 0, thorn is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, ret is 1 if the first character in the list, i, is '@', otherwise ret is 0. thorn is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0. If i is '*', then if thorn is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution. If i is not '*' and not '@', then the program continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 2 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*' and the program continues with the next iteration unless `thorn` is 2, in which case the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 2 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 more than its original value if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `thorn` is 0 if `i` is '@', otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0, `i` is the third character in the list. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
