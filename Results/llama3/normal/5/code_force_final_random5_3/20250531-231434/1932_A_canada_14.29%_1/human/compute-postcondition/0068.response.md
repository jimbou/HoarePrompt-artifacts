To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters.
- `ret` is the number of '@' characters in the list `s`.
- `thorn` is 0 or 2.
- `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.
- `_` is 1.
- `input()` must be greater than 0.
- The number of '@' characters in the list `s`, which is `ret`, is being printed.

The loop head involves `_` and `int(input())`. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1 because it's the loop variable, and `int(input())` needs to be greater than the current value of `_` to ensure the loop condition is met for another iteration.

Given that `_` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `_` should be 2. Also, since `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases and we've already executed one iteration, `stdin` should contain `t-4` test cases for the loop to potentially execute again.

The other variables (`len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, and the condition on `input()`) are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is the number of '@' characters in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0 or 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `_` is 2, `input()` must be greater than 1, and the number of '@' characters in the list `s` which is `ret` is being printed.**
