Postcondition: ***len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, ret is 1 if the first character in the list, i, is '@', otherwise ret is 0. thorn is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0. If i is '*', then if thorn is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution. If i is not '*' and not '@', then the program continues execution.***
