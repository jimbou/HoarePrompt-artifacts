Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is the number of '@' characters in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0 if the last character in `s` is not '*', otherwise `thorn` is the number of '*' characters in the list `s` that are not followed by another '*', `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `_` is 2, `input()` must be greater than 1, and the number of '@' characters in the list `s` which is `ret` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The length of the list `s` is still between 1 and 1000.
*   The list `s` still has at least `len` characters.
*   The variable `ret` now holds the total number of '@' characters in the list `s`.
*   The variable `thorn` is 0 if the last character in `s` is not '*', otherwise it holds the number of '*' characters in the list `s` that are not followed by another '*'.
*   The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
