Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 1 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.***
