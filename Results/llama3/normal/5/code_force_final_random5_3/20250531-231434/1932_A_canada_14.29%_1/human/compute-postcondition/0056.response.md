Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains t-3 or t-4 test cases, `_` is 1, `input()` must be greater than 0. If the first character in the list `s` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the first character in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is 1 or 2. If `thorn` is 2, then `stdin` contains t-4 test cases and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character in the list `s` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 0 or 1, and the condition `thorn == 0` is checked but does not change the state of the program.***
