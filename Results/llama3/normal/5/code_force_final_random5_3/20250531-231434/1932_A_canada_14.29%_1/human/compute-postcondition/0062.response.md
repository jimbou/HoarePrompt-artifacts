Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains t-3 or t-4 test cases, `_` is 1, `input()` must be greater than 0. If the second character in the list `s` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the second character in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is 1. If the second character in the list `s` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 0.**

The condition `thorn == 0` is checked, but it does not change the state of the program because `thorn` is either 0 or 1, and the condition is true when `thorn` is 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
