To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` has at least one character. Since `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` must have at least `len` characters, we can conclude that `s` has at least one character. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be the first character in `s`.

State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `_` is 2, `input()` must be greater than 1, the number of '@' characters in the list `s` which is `ret` is being printed, `i` is the first character in `s`**
