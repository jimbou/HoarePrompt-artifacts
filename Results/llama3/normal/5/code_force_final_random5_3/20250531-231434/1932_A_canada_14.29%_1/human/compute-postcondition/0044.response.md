Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `_` is 1, the first character in the list `s` is '*', and it is not equal to '@'. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of the variables.***
