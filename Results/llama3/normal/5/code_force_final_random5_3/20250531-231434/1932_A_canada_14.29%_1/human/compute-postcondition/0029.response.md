Postcondition: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 2 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0, `i` is the third character in the list. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no changes are made. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.**
