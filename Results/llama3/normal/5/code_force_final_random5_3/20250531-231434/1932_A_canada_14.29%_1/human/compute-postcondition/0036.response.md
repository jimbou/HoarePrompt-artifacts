To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If the list `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Since `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, we can conclude that `s` must have at least 1 character.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `_` is 1, `input()` must be greater than 0, `i` is the first character in the list `s`**
