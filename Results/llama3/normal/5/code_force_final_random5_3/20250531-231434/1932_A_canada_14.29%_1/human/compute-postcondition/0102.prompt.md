Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is always empty ('.').
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn == 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters that must have at least len characters, ret is the number of '@' characters in the list s, thorn is 0 if the last character in the list is not '*', otherwise thorn is 1 if the last character in the list is '*', stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, input() must be greater than 0, and the number of '@' characters in the list s which is ret is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters that must have at least len characters, ret is the number of '@' characters in the list s, thorn is 0 or 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, input() must be greater than 0, and the number of '@' characters in the list s which is ret is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is the number of '@' characters in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0 if the last character in `s` is not '*', otherwise `thorn` is the number of '*' characters in the list `s` that are not followed by another '*', `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `_` is 2, `input()` must be greater than 1, and the number of '@' characters in the list `s` which is `ret` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
