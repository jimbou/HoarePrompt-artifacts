Postcondition: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len+2` characters, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `_` is 2, `input()` must be greater than 1, the number of '@' characters in the list `s` which is `ret` is being printed. If the second character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 2 if the first character in `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1, and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '@', then `ret` is 1 if the first character in `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 2 if the first character in `s` is not '*', otherwise `thorn` is 4 if the first character in `s` is '*'. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
