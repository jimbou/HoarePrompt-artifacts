Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 2 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if the first character in the list was '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0, `i` is the third character in the list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin now contains t-2 test cases.
