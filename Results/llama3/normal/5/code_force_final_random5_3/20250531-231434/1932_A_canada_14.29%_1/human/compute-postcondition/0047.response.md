Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `_` is 1, `input()` must be greater than 0. If the first character in the list `s` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of the variables. If the first character in the list `s` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0, and the condition `thorn == 0` is checked but does not change the state of the program.***
