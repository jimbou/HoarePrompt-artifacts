Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is an integer equal to the second input, b is an integer equal to the third input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively. The second line calculates the minimum value between `n` and `b - a` and assigns it to `k`. The value of `_` remains unchanged as 1. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the input values, and `k` is set to the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by three.
