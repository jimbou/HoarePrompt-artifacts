Output: **n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. b is larger than a, and this is printed: the sum of the first k terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from b - k + 1 to b, plus the product of (n - k) and a**
