Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is an integer equal to the second input, b is an integer equal to the third input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

The code block reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `k` is then calculated as the minimum of `n` and the difference between `b` and `a`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. After the execution of the code block, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
