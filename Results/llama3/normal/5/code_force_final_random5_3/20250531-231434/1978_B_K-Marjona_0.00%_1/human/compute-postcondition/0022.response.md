Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first input, a is an integer equal to the second input, b is an integer equal to the third input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If b is less than or equal to a, the program prints a*n where a is the second input and n is the first input. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of the k largest numbers from a to b, where k is the minimum of n and b - a, plus the product of the remaining n - k numbers and a.***
