Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is an integer equal to the second input, b is an integer equal to the third input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is equal to the number of test cases, stdin is empty. If b is less than or equal to a, the program prints a*n where a is the second input and n is the first input. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of the k largest numbers from a to b, where k is the minimum of n and b - a, plus the product of the remaining n - k numbers and a.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all test cases in the input. The values of n, a, and b are the same as the last test case, and k is the minimum of n and b - a for the last test case. The variable _ is equal to the number of test cases, indicating that the loop has executed for all test cases. The stdin is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The output of the program is either the product of a and n if b is less than or equal to a, or the sum of the k largest numbers from a to b plus the product of the remaining n - k numbers and a if b is greater than a.
