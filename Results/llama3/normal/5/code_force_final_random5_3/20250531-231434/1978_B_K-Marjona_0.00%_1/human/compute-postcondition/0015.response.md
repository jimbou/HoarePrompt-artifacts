Postcondition: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is an integer equal to the second input, b is an integer equal to the third input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If b is less than or equal to a, then a * n is printed, where a is the second input and n is the first input. Otherwise, the sum of the k largest numbers from a to b, plus the product of (n - k) and a is printed, where k is the minimum of n and b - a.**
