Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers: n, a, and b. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the k largest numbers from a to b, where k is the minimum of n and b - a, plus the product of the remaining n - k numbers and a, if b is greater than a. If b is less than or equal to a, it simply prints the product of a and n. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
