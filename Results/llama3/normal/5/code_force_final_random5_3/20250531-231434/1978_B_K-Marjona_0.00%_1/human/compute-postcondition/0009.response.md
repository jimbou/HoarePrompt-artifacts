The only object in the loop head is variable `_` and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and stdin. If `_` is less than the number of test cases in stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 1 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
State: **n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
