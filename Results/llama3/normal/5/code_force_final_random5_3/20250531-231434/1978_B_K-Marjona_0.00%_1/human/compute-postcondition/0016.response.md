The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ is 2 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is an integer equal to the second input, b is an integer equal to the third input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**
