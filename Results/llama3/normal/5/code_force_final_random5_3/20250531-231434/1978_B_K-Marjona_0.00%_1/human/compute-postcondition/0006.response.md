The code prints the sum of the products of the number of terms and the average of the first and last terms of two arithmetic sequences.

The first sequence has k terms, starting from b - k + 1 and ending at b. The average of the first and last terms is (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2. The sum of the products of the number of terms and the average is (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k.

The second sequence has n - k terms, all of which are a. The sum of the products of the number of terms and the average is (n - k) * a.

Output: **(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a**
