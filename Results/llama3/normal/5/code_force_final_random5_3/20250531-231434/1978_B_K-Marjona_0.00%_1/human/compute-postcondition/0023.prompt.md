Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = min(n, b - a)
    if b <= a:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed, which is a * n. If b is larger than a, the sum of the first k terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from b - k + 1 to b, plus the product of (n - k) and a is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, a is an integer equal to the second input, b is an integer equal to the third input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If b is less than or equal to a, then a * n is printed, where a is the second input and n is the first input. Otherwise, the sum of the k largest numbers from a to b, plus the product of (n - k) and a is printed, where k is the minimum of n and b - a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first input, a is an integer equal to the second input, b is an integer equal to the third input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If b is less than or equal to a, the program prints a*n where a is the second input and n is the first input. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of the k largest numbers from a to b, where k is the minimum of n and b - a, plus the product of the remaining n - k numbers and a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
