Output: **n is an integer equal to the first input, a is an integer equal to the second input, b is an integer equal to the third input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and this is printed: The sum of the k largest numbers from a to b, where k is the minimum of n and b - a, plus the product of the remaining n - k numbers and a, which is equal to (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a**
