Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is 0, cnt is a different value from the previous iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If cnt is at least 2, res is its previous value plus math.comb(cnt, 2) times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt, and now res is increased by math.comb(cnt, 3).**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0, and `n` remains an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. The dictionary `num_of_lens` still has at least 3 key-value pairs, and the list `nums` is still empty. The variable `x` is still the last element in the list, and `_` is still 0. The value of `cnt` is still different from the previous iteration. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The value of `res` has been updated: if `cnt` is at least 2, `res` is now its previous value plus the combination of `cnt` and 2 times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and then increased by the combination of `cnt` and 3.
