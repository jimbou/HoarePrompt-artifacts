The code prints the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in `num_of_lens`. Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, and `nums` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is also empty. Therefore, the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in `num_of_lens` is 0.
Output: **0**
