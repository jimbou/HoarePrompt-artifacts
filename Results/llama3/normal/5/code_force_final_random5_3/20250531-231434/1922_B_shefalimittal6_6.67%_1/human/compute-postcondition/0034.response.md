Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of `x` is increased by 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `_` is 1, `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, indicating that the count of `x` in the dictionary has been incremented. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on their values are still valid.
