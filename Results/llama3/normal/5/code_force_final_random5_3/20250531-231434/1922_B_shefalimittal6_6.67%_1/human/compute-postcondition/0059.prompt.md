Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 1, res is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least one value, `nums` is a list of n integers, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 1, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements times the total sum of the counts of all elements in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, otherwise `res` remains the same, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least two values, `nums` is a list of n integers, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 1, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `cnt` is 1 or less, no changes are made to `res`. If `cnt` is 2 or more, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements times the total sum of the counts of all elements in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least three values, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 1, cnt is the third value in num_of_lens, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt, total_sum is the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
