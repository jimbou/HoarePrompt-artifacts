Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least three values, `nums` is a list of n integers, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 1, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` remains the same, the size of the list `n` is still between 1 and 3 * 10^5, the dictionary `num_of_lens` still contains the counts of each element in the list, the list `nums` is unchanged, the last element `x` is still the same, the variable `_` is still 1, the third value in `num_of_lens` is still `cnt`, and the result `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
