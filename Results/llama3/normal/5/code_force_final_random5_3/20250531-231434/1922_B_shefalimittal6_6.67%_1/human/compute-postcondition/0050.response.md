Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least two values, `nums` is a list of n integers, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 1, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0 minus two, the integer `n` is still within the range of 1 to 3 * 10^5, the dictionary `num_of_lens` still contains all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as values, the list `nums` still contains `n` integers, the last element of `nums` is still `x`, the variable `_` is still 1, the result `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements, `cnt` is still the second value in `num_of_lens`, and the standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
