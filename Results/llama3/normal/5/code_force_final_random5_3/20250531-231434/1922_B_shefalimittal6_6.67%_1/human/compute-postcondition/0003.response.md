The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and list `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the x is the first element in the list.
State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that must have at least 1 element, x is the first element in the list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**
