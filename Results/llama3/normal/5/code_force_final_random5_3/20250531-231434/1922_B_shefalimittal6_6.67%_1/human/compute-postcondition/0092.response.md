Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is t, res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains no test cases, and the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in num_of_lens which is res is being printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of test cases `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The dictionary `num_of_lens` contains the count of each element in the list `nums`, where each element is a key and its count is the value. The list `nums` is empty, and `x` is the last element in the list. The variable `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variable `res` contains the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in `num_of_lens`, which is being printed. Finally, the standard input `stdin` contains no test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
