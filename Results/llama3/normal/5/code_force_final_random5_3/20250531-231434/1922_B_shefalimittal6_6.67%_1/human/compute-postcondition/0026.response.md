Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is 0, cnt is a different value from the previous iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, res is its previous value plus math.comb(cnt, 2) times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The number of test cases, `t`, remains greater than 0. The integer `n` is still within the range of 1 to 3 * 10^5. The dictionary `num_of_lens` retains at least 3 key-value pairs. The list `nums` remains empty, and `x` is still the last element in the list (which is empty). The variable `_` is still 0. The value of `cnt` is different from its previous iteration. The standard input `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The variable `res` has been updated to its previous value plus the result of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` times the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
