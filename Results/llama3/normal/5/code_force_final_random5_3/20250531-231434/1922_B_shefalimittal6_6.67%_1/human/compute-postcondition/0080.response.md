Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus `n`, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `n` elements, `x` is the nth element in the list, `_` is 2, `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, `cnt` is the second value in the dictionary, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (`n`+5) test cases, and the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and ... (`n` times), `num_of_lens` must have at least 2 values.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, where `cnt` is the second value in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin contains one less test case than before.
