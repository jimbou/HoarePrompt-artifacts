Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 1, res is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

The value of `res` is reset to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0 minus two, the integer `n` is still within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), the dictionary `num_of_lens` still contains the counts of elements in the list `nums`, and the list `nums` remains unchanged with `x` as its last element. The value of `_` is still 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
