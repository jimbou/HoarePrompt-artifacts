Postcondition: ***t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is 0, cnt is a different value from the previous iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If cnt is at least 2, res is its previous value plus math.comb(cnt, 2) times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. If cnt is at least 3, res is increased by math.comb(cnt, 3). Otherwise, res remains unchanged.***
