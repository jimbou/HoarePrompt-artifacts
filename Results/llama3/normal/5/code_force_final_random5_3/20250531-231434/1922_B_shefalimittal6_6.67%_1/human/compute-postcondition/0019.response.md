Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 0, `cnt` is a different value from the previous iteration, `res` is its previous value plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0, the integer `n` remains within the range 1 to 3 * 10^5, the dictionary `num_of_lens` still has at least 2 key-value pairs, the list `nums` is still empty, the last element in the list `x` is unchanged, the variable `_` is still 0, the counter `cnt` is a different value from the previous iteration, and the result `res` has been updated by adding the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time to its previous value. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
