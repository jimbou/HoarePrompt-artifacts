Postcondition: ***`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 0, `cnt` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If `cnt` is at least 2, `res` is its previous value plus the product of math.comb(cnt, 2) and total_sum, where total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. If `cnt` is at least 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)` added to its previous value. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
