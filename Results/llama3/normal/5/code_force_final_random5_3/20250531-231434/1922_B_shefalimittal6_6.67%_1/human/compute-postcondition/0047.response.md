Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least one value, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 1, cnt is the first value in num_of_lens and is greater than or equal to 2, res is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements times the total sum of the counts of all elements in num_of_lens except cnt, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

Explanation: The code calculates the total sum of the counts of all elements in num_of_lens except cnt, and then adds the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements times this total sum to res. The value of cnt remains unchanged, as it is the first value in num_of_lens. The values of t, n, num_of_lens, nums, x, and _ remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of stdin remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
