To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least 2 key-value pairs, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` has at least 1 key-value pair, and `cnt` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `num_of_lens` must have at least 2 key-value pairs, and `cnt` must be the next value in `num_of_lens`. Since we don't know the exact values in `num_of_lens`, we can't determine the exact value of `cnt` at the start of the next iteration. However, we can say that `cnt` will be a different value from the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 0, `cnt` is a different value from the previous iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If `cnt` is at least 2, `res` is its previous value plus the product of math.comb(cnt, 2) and total_sum, where total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. If `cnt` is at least 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)` added to its previous value. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
