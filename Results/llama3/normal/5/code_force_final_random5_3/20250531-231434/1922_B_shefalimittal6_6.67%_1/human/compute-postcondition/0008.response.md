Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first element of `nums` as a key and its count as the value, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` remains the same, the integer `n` remains the same, the dictionary `num_of_lens` now has an updated count for the first element `x` of the list `nums`, the list `nums` remains the same, the first element `x` of the list remains the same, the variable `_` remains 0, and the standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` has been incremented by 1.
