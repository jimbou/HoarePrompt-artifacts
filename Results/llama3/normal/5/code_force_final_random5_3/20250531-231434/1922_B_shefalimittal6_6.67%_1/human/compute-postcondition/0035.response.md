To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `nums` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of `x` is increased by 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `_` is 1, `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases**
