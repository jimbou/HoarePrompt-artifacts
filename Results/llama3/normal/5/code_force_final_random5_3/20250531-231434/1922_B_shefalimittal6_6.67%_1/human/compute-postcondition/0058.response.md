Postcondition: ***t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least three values, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 1, cnt is the third value in num_of_lens, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, res is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt, total_sum is the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
