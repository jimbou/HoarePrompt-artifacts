Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least two values, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 1, cnt is the second value in num_of_lens, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, res is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements times the total sum of the counts of all elements in num_of_lens except cnt.**

The code snippet only contains one line that affects the state of the program. This line increments the value of `res` by the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements times the total sum of the counts of all elements in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, and the total sum is calculated by summing up all the counts in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. The value of `res` is increased by this product. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
