Output: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 1, res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, and res is printed, res (where res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens)**
