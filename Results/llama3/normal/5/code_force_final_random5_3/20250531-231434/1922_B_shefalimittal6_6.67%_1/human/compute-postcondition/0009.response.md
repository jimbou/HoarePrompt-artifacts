Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in the list `nums`. The dictionary `num_of_lens` now contains all elements of `nums` as keys and their respective counts as values. The list `nums` is empty, indicating that all elements have been processed. The variable `x` holds the last element that was processed, and the other variables remain unchanged.
