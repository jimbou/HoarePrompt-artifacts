The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. The current value of `num_of_lens[x]` is the count of the second element `x` in the list `nums`. If `x` is not already a key in `num_of_lens`, its count is initialized to 1.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first element of `nums` as a key and its count as the value, where the count of the second element `x` is incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that must have at least 0 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**
