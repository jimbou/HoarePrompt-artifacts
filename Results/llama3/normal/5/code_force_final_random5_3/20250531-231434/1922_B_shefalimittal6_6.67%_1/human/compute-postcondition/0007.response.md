The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 0 elements, x is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 1 element and the x is the first element in the list.
State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first element of `nums` as a key and its count as the value, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**
