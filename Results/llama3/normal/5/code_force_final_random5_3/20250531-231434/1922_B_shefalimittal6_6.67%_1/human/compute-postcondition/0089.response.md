Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus `n`, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `n` elements, `x` is the nth element in the list, `_` is 2, `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (`n`+4) test cases if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, otherwise stdin contains multiple test cases minus (`n`+5) test cases if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and ... (`n` times), `num_of_lens` must have at least `n` values.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `res` will have accumulated the total number of combinations of each count in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all other counts, and the number of combinations of each count taken 3 at a time if the count is greater than or equal to 3. The variable `num_of_lens` will have all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list. The variable `stdin` will contain multiple test cases minus (`n`+4) test cases if any count is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, otherwise it will contain multiple test cases minus (`n`+5) test cases if any count is greater than or equal to 3. The count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and ... (`n` times). The dictionary `num_of_lens` must have at least `n` values.
