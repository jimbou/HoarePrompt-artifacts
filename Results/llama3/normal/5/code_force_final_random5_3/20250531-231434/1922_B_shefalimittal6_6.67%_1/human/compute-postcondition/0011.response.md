The only object in the loop head is `num_of_lens`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least 1 value, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `nums` is an empty list, which means `num_of_lens` must have at least 1 key-value pair for the loop to execute. Also, `cnt` is a value in `num_of_lens`, so it must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 0, `res` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `cnt` is at least 1**
