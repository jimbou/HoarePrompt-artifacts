You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        res = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: t is 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is t, res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains no test cases, and the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in num_of_lens which is res is being printed

```

Return Postconditions: t is 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is t, res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains no test cases, and the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in num_of_lens which is res is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
