The only objects in the loop head are variables  cnt and num_of_lens, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens.  If the dictionary has at least 3 key-value pairs the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, num_of_lens has at least 2 key-value pairs, cnt is a different value from the previous iteration. So for the loop to be executed one more time the dictionary must have at least 3 key-value pairs and cnt is a different value from the previous iteration.
State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is 0, cnt is a different value from the previous iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If cnt is at least 2, res is its previous value plus math.comb(cnt, 2) times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. Otherwise, res remains unchanged.**
