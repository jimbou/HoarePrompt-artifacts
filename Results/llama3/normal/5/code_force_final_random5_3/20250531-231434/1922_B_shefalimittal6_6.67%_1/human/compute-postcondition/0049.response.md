The only object in the loop head is variable  cnt and dictionary num_of_lens, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens.  If the dictionary has at least 2 values the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, num_of_lens has at least one value, cnt is the first value in num_of_lens. So for the loop to be executed one more time the dictionary must have at least 2 values and the cnt is the second value in the dictionary.
State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least two values, `nums` is a list of n integers, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 1, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements times the total sum of the counts of all elements in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
