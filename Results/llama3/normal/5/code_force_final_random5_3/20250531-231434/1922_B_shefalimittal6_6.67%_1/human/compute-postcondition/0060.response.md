Based on the initial state, the print statement will output the value of `res`, which is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements and the total sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `nums` and its value is the count of that element in the list.
* `cnt` represents each unique count in `num_of_lens`.
* The number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements is calculated using the combination formula (nCr), where n is `cnt` and r is 3.
* The number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements is also calculated using the combination formula (nCr), where n is `cnt` and r is 2.
* The total sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt` is calculated by summing up all the values in `num_of_lens` except for the value corresponding to the current `cnt`.
* The product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements and the total sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt` is calculated for each `cnt`.
* The sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements and the product calculated in the previous step is calculated for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens`.
* The final result `res` is the sum of all these calculations.

Since the exact values of `nums` and `num_of_lens` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens)**
