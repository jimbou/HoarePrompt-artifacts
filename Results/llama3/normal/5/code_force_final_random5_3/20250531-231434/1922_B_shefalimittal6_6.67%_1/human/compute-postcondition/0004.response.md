Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first element of `nums` as a key and its count as the value, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens` has been updated to include the count of the first element `x` in the list `nums`. The count is incremented by 1 if `x` is already a key in the dictionary, otherwise, it is initialized to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
