Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is 0, res is the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in num_of_lens, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `res` now holds the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in `num_of_lens`. This means that for each count in `num_of_lens`, if the count is at least 2, `res` is increased by the product of the count choose 2 (math.comb(cnt, 2)) and the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens`. If the count is at least 3, `res` is also increased by the count choose 3 (math.comb(cnt, 3)). The other variables remain unchanged.
