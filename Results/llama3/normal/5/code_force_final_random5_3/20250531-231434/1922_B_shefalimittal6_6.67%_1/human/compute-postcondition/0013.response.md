Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 0, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)` added to its previous value, `cnt` is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
