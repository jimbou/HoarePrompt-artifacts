The only object in the loop head is variable  cnt and dictionary  num_of_lens, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens.  If the dictionary has at least 1 value the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus n, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers that must have at least n elements, x is the nth element in the list, _ is 2, res is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (n+4) test cases, and the count of x in num_of_lens is increased by 1, and the value of num_of_lens[x] is increased by 1, and the value of num_of_lens[x] is increased by 1, and ... (n times). So for the loop to be executed  the dictionary must have at least 1 value and cnt is the first value in the dictionary.
State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus n, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least n elements, `x` is the nth element in the list, `_` is 2, `res` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus (n+4) test cases, and the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and ... (n times), `num_of_lens` must have at least 1 value, cnt is the first value in the dictionary**
