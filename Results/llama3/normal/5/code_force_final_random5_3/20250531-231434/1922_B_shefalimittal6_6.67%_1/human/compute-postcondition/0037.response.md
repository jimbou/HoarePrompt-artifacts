The only object in the loop head is variable  x and list  nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of `x` is increased by 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `_` is 1, `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**
