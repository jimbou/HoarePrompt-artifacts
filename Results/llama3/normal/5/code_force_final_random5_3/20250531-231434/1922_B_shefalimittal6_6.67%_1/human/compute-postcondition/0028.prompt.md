Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 0, `res` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `nums` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 0, `cnt` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If `cnt` is at least 2, `res` is its previous value plus the product of math.comb(cnt, 2) and total_sum, where total_sum is the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. If `cnt` is at least 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)` added to its previous value. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is 0, cnt is a different value from the previous iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If cnt is at least 2, res is its previous value plus math.comb(cnt, 2) times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. Otherwise, res remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs, nums is an empty list, x is the last element in the list, _ is 0, cnt is a different value from the previous iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. If cnt is at least 2, res is its previous value plus math.comb(cnt, 2) times the sum of all values in num_of_lens except cnt. If cnt is at least 3, res is increased by math.comb(cnt, 3). Otherwise, res remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
