To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `_` is 1, `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases**
