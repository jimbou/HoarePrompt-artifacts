The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n), `_` is 0**
