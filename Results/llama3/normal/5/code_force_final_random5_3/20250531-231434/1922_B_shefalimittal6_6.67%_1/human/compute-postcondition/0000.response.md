The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer `n`, the value of `t` will be the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n).**
