Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least one value, `nums` is a list of n integers, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 1, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0 minus two, the integer `n` is still within the range of 1 to 3 * 10^5, the dictionary `num_of_lens` still contains the counts of each element in the list `nums`, the list `nums` is still the same, the last element `x` is still the same, the variable `_` is still 1, the result `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements, `cnt` is still the first value in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 3, and the standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
