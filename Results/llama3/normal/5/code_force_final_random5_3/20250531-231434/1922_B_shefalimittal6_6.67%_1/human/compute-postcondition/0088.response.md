Postcondition: ***`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus `n`, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `n` elements, `x` is the nth element in the list, `_` is 2, `num_of_lens` must have at least 2 values. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus (`n`+4) test cases. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
