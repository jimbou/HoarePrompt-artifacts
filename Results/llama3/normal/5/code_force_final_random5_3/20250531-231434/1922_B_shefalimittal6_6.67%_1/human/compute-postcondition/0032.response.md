Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 1, res is the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in num_of_lens, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The number of test cases, t, has decreased by two. The value of n has been updated to an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, inclusive. The dictionary num_of_lens now contains all elements of the list nums as keys and their respective counts as values. The list nums has been populated with n integers. The variable x holds the last element of the list nums. The variable _ remains unchanged at 1. The variable res still holds the sum of all combinations of counts of elements in num_of_lens. The standard input, stdin, now contains multiple test cases minus three test cases.
