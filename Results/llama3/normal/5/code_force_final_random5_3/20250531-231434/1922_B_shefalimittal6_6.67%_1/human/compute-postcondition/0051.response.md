Postcondition: ***`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least two values, `nums` is a list of n integers, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 1, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `cnt` elements. Otherwise, `res` is increased by the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `cnt` elements times the total sum of the counts of all elements in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.***
