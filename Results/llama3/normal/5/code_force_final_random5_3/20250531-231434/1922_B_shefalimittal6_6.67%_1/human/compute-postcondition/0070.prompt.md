Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus four, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 2, res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases, and res is printed, res (where res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens)
Code of the loop:
for x in nums:
    num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus four, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `_` is 2, `res` is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding cnt for all cnt in `num_of_lens`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases, and `res` is printed, and the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus four, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `_` is 2, `res` is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding cnt for all cnt in `num_of_lens`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases, `res` is printed, and the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus five, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `_` is 2, `res` is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding cnt for all cnt in `num_of_lens`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six test cases, `res` is printed, and the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
