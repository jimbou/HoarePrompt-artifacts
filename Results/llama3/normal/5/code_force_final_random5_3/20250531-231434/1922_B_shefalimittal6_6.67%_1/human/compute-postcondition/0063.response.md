Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus four, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, nums is a list of n integers, x is the last element in the list, _ is 2, res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases, and res is printed, res (where res is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in num_of_lens excluding cnt for all cnt in num_of_lens)**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `n` becomes an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5). The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `nums`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus five test cases. No other variables are affected.
