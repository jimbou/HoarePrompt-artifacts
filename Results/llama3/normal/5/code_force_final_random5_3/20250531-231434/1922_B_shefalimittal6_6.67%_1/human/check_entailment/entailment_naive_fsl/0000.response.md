Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length. The program currently adds the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of any other length, which is incorrect. It should only count the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length that is greater than the length of the two sticks.

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3], the program will incorrectly count the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of length 1 and 1 stick of length 1, which does not form a valid triangle.

To fix this issue, the program should only count the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length that is greater than the length of the two sticks. This can be achieved by iterating over the lengths of the sticks in ascending order and keeping track of the number of sticks of each length that have been seen so far.
