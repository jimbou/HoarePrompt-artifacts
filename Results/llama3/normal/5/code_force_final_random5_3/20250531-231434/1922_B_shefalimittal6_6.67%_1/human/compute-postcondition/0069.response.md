Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus five, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of `nums` as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list, `nums` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `_` is 2, `res` is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from cnt elements plus the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from cnt elements and the total sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding cnt for all cnt in `num_of_lens`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six test cases, `res` is printed, and the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1.**

The code increments the count of the third element `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
