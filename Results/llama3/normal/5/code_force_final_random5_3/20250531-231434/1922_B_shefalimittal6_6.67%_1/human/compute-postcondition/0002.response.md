Output State: **t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n), _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**

The code reads two lines from stdin for a test case. The first line assigns an integer value to `n`, which is the number of integers in the second line. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers to `nums`. The dictionary `num_of_lens` is initialized but remains empty as no operations are performed on it. The variable `_` is not affected by the code and remains 0. The number of test cases `t` is not modified by the code and remains greater than 0. Stdin now contains one less test case.
