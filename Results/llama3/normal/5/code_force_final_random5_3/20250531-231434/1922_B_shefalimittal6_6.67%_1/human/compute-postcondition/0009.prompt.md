Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n), _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case
Code of the loop:
for x in nums:
    num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first element of `nums` as a key and its count as the value, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first element of `nums` as a key and its count as the value, where the count of the second element `x` is incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that must have at least 0 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first element of `nums` as a key and its count as the value, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
