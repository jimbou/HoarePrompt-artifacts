Postcondition: ***`t` is the number of test cases that must be greater than 0 minus two, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all elements of nums as keys and their counts as the values, where the count of each element is increased by the number of times it appears in the list and must have at least one value, `nums` is a list of n integers, `x` is the last element in the list, `_` is 1, `res` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3***
