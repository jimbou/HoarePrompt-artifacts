This function generates a graph with n nodes and m edges, where n and m are integers within certain bounds, and then finds the minimum edge in the graph using a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) from the node connected by the minimum edge and prints the minimum edge value and the length of the DFS result. Finally, it prints the DFS result.
