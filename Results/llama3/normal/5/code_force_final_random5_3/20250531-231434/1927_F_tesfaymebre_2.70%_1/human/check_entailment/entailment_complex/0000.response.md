Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to find a simple cycle in a graph with the minimum edge weight. The program uses a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum edge and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the cycle.

The program correctly implements the DSU data structure and the DFS algorithm. The DSU data structure is used to find the minimum edge in the graph, and the DFS algorithm is used to find the cycle that includes the minimum edge.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are multiple cycles in the graph with the same minimum edge weight. In this case, the program will find one of the cycles and print its vertices.

The program does not have any syntax errors and the logic is correct. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
