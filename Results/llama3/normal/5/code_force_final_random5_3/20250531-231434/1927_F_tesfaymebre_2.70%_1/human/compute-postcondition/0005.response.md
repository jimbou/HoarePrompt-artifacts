To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`. The objects involved are `_` and `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `test_cases` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 2, and `test_cases` must be greater than 2.

The state of `func_6()` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, and the function `func_6()` has been executed twice, `_` is 2**
