Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing m tuples (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3, i is m-1, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1, _min_edge is positive infinity, node_u is -1, node_v is -1.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least one tuple (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3, i is m-1, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1, if parent_u is equal to parent_v, then _min_edge is updated to dsu.min_edge[parent_u] if it is less than the original _min_edge, and parent_u is equal to parent_v after the union operation, otherwise parent_u is equal to parent_v.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least two tuples (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3, i is m-2, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1. If parent_u and parent_v are the same, then parent_u and parent_v are merged into a single parent in the DSU, u and v are connected in the DSU with weight w. If the minimum edge value of the parent of u in the DSU is less than _min_edge, then node_u is u and node_v is v. Otherwise, no changes are made. If parent_u and parent_v are different, then u and v are in the same set in the DSU, parent_u is the parent of the set containing u and v in the DSU, and parent_v is the parent of the set containing u and v in the DSU.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least one tuple (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3, i is m-1, dsu is a DSU object where u and v are either in the same set or merged, node_u is u, node_v is v, and if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge, then _min_edge is the minimum edge of the set containing u and v in the DSU, otherwise _min_edge remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
