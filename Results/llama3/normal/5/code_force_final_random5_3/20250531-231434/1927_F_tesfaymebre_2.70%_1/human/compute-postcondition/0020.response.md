Postcondition: ***curr, parent, node_v are non-negative integers, path is a list of non-negative integers that includes the current node (curr), graph is a dictionary where each key is a non-negative integer and each value is a list of non-negative integers that has at least 2 elements, colors is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph where the color of the current node (colors[curr]) is 1, nei is the second element in the list of graph[curr]. If colors[nei] is not equal to 2 and nei is not equal to parent, then if res is not empty and node_v is in set_res, the function returns a list of integers 'res' that contains some values but the exact values are not specified in the initial state, however, it is known that 'res' is related to the graph, colors, and the current node 'curr' with color 1. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
