Postcondition: **The program either returns a list of integers (res) that contains the results of the dfs function, where each integer in the list corresponds to a node in the graph, and the color of the current node (colors[curr]) is 1, and the list is also contained in a set (set_res) for efficient lookups, or it continues executing the next part of the program if the list is empty or the current node is not in the set of results.**
