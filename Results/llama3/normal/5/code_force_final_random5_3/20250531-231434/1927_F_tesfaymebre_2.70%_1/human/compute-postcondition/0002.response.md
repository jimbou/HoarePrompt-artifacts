Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, and the function `func_6()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify it. The function `func_6()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are unknown, as its implementation is not provided. Therefore, the output state only reflects the execution of the function, without any changes to the value of `test_cases`.
