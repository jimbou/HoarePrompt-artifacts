Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is an empty list, i is -1, dsu is a DSU object where all nodes are merged into a single set, node_u is u, node_v is v, and _min_edge is the minimum edge of the set containing u and v in the DSU.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the DSU object has merged all nodes into a single set, and the minimum edge value of this set is stored in the variable _min_edge. The variables node_u and node_v are set to u and v, respectively, which are the nodes connected by the minimum edge. The list of edges is empty, and the index i is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The graph and other variables remain unchanged.
