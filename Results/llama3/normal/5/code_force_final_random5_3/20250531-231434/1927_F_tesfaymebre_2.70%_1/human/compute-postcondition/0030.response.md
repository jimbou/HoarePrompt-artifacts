Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least one tuple (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3, i is m-1, dsu is a DSU object where u and v are in the same set, node_u is u, node_v is v, and if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge, then _min_edge is the minimum edge of the set containing u and v in the DSU, otherwise _min_edge remains unchanged.***
