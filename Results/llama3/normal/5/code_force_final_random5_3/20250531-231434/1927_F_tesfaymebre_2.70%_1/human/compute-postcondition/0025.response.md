Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least two tuples (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3, i is m-2, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1. If parent_u and parent_v are the same, then parent_u and parent_v are merged into a single parent in the DSU, u and v are connected in the DSU with weight w. If the minimum edge value of the parent of u in the DSU is less than _min_edge, then node_u is u and node_v is v. Otherwise, no changes are made. If parent_u and parent_v are different, then u and v are in the same set in the DSU, parent_u is the parent of the set containing u and v in the DSU, and parent_v is the parent of the set containing u and v in the DSU.***
