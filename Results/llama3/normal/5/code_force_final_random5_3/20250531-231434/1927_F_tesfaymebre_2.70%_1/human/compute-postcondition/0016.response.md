The only object in the loop head is variable  nei and graph[curr], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the graph[curr].  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, graph[curr] has at least 1 element, nei is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the nei is the second element in the list.
State: **curr, parent, node_v are non-negative integers, path is a list of non-negative integers that includes the current node (curr), graph is a dictionary where each key is a non-negative integer and each value is a list of non-negative integers that has at least 2 elements, colors is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph where the color of the current node (colors[curr]) is 1, nei is the second element in the list of graph[curr]**
