Output State: **`curr` is a non-negative integer, `parent` is a non-negative integer, `path` is a list of non-negative integers that includes the current node (`curr`), `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a non-negative integer and each value is a list of non-negative integers, `colors` is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph where the color of the current node (`colors[curr]`) is 2, `node_v` is a non-negative integer, `nei` is the last neighbor in the list, `res` is a list of integers, `set_res` is a set of integers. If `colors[nei]` is not equal to 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then the list `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`.**

The code changes the color of the current node (`curr`) to 2, which is reflected in the `colors` list. All other variables remain unchanged, and their properties and relationships as described in the initial state still hold.
