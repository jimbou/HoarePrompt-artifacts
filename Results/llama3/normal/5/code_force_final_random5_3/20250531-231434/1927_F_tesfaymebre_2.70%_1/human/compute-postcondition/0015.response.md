Postcondition: ***curr, parent, node_v are non-negative integers, path is a list of non-negative integers that includes the current node (curr), graph is a dictionary where each key is a non-negative integer and each value is a list of non-negative integers, colors is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph where the color of the current node (colors[curr]) is 1. If colors[nei] is not equal to 2 and nei is not equal to parent, then either the program returns a list of integers (res) that contains the results of the dfs function, where each integer in the list corresponds to a node in the graph, and the list is also contained in a set (set_res) for efficient lookups, or it continues executing the next part of the program if the list is empty or the current node is not in the set of results. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
