To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change.

The loop head is `for (w, u, v) in edges:`, which means the variables that can be adjusted are `w`, `u`, `v`, and `edges`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the `edges` list, which is sorted in descending order. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m-2`, which means the loop has already processed `m-2` edges.

For the loop to execute again, the `edges` list must have at least one more element. Since the list is sorted in descending order, the next edge to be processed will have a smaller weight `w` than the previous one.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration can be adjusted as follows:

* `w` is the weight of the next edge in the `edges` list, which is smaller than the previous weight.
* `u` and `v` are the nodes of the next edge in the `edges` list.
* `edges` has at least one more element, which is the next edge to be processed.
* `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `m-1`.
* The other variables (`n`, `m`, `graph`, `dsu`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `_min_edge`) remain unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to n, `m` is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a dictionary with two keys, `u` and `v`, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by `func_3` for `u` or `v`, and `m-1` additional elements in each list, `edges` is a sorted list in descending order containing at least one tuple `(w, u, v)` where `w`, `u`, and `v` are the values returned by `func_3`, `i` is `m-1`, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1`, `node_u` and `node_v` are unchanged, and `_min_edge` is unchanged.**
