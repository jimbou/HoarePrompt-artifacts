Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to n, `m` is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `graph` is a dictionary with two keys, `u` and `v`, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for `u` or `v`, and `m-1` additional elements in each list, `edges` is a sorted list in descending order containing at least one tuple (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3, `i` is `m-1`, `dsu` is a DSU object with `u` and `v` merged, `node_u` and `node_v` are unchanged, `_min_edge` is unchanged, `parent_u` is the parent of the merged set of `u` and `v` in the DSU, and `parent_v` is the parent of the merged set of `u` and `v` in the DSU.**

In this output state, the DSU object `dsu` has merged the sets containing `u` and `v` into a single set, with `w` as the weight of the edge between them. The `graph` dictionary remains unchanged, as well as the `edges` list, `i`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `_min_edge`. The `parent_u` and `parent_v` variables now point to the parent of the merged set in the DSU.
