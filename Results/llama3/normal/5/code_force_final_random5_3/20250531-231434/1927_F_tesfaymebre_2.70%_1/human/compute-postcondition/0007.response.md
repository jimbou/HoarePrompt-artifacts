Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and the function `func_6()` has been executed the same number of times as the number of iterations of the loop, `_` is `test_cases - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` will be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop was executed, and the function `func_6()` will have been called the same number of times as the number of iterations of the loop. The variable `_` will have the value of `test_cases - 1`, which is the last value it was assigned during the loop's execution.
