Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least one tuple (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3, i is m-1, dsu is a DSU object initialized with n + 1, node_u and node_v are unchanged, _min_edge is unchanged, parent_u is the parent of u in the DSU, and parent_v is the parent of v in the DSU.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning the result of the `dsu.find()` method to a variable. The `dsu.find()` method returns the parent of a node in the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure. 

The first line assigns the parent of `u` to `parent_u`, and the second line assigns the parent of `v` to `parent_v`. These assignments do not modify any other variables or data structures in the initial state. 

Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the precondition, with the addition of the `parent_u` and `parent_v` variables, which now hold the parents of `u` and `v` in the DSU, respectively.
