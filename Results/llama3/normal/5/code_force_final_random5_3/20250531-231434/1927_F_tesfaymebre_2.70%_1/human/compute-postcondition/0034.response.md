Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is an empty list, i is -1, dsu is a DSU object where all nodes are merged into a single set, node_u is u, node_v is v, _min_edge is the minimum edge of the set containing u and v in the DSU, colors is a list of n+1 zeros, and res is the result of the dfs function call with arguments node_u, -1, and an empty list.**

The code initializes a list of colors with n+1 zeros and calls a dfs function with node_u, -1, and an empty list as arguments. The dfs function's result is stored in the res variable. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
