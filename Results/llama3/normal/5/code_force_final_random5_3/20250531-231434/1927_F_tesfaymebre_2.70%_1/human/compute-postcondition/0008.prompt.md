You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No specific precondition can be determined for the variables in the function signature as the function does not take any parameters. However, based on the problem description, it can be inferred that the function is part of a larger program that reads input from the user and processes it to find a simple cycle in a graph.
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: `test_cases` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and the function `func_6()` has been executed the same number of times as the number of iterations of the loop, `_` is `test_cases - 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
