The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable, it doesn't affect the loop's execution, but its value will be increased by 1.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, and the function `func_6()` has been executed, `_` is 1**
