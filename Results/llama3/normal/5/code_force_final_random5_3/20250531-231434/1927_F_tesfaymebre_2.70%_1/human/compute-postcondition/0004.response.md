Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, and the function `func_6()` has been executed twice, `_` is 1**

The code `func_6()` executes the function `func_6()` again. Since the function has already been executed once in the initial state, it will be executed twice in total. The values of the other variables, `test_cases` and `_`, remain unchanged.
