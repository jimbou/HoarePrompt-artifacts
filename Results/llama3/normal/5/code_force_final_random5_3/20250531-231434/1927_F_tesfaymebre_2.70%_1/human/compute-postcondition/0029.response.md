Output State: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= m, m is an integer greater than or equal to n, m is less than or equal to min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), graph is a dictionary with two keys, u and v, each containing a list with the other key and the value returned by func_3 for u or v, and m-1 additional elements in each list, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing at least one tuple (w, u, v) where w, u, and v are the values returned by func_3, i is m-1, dsu is a DSU object where u and v are in the same set, node_u is u, node_v is v, _min_edge is the minimum edge of the set containing u and v in the DSU, parent_u is the parent of the set containing u and v in the DSU, and parent_v is the parent of the set containing u and v in the DSU.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `i`, or `dsu`. It only assigns the minimum edge of the set containing `u` and `v` in the DSU to `_min_edge`, and assigns `u` and `v` to `node_u` and `node_v`, respectively. The values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` remain unchanged as they are the parents of the set containing `u` and `v` in the DSU.
