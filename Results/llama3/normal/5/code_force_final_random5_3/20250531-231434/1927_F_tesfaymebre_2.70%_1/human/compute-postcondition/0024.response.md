Functionality: **This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph to find a path that includes a specific node (node_v) and returns the path if found. The function takes as input the current node (curr), its parent node (parent), the current path, the graph, a list of colors representing the state of each node, and the target node (node_v). The function returns a list of non-negative integers representing the path if the target node is found, otherwise it returns an empty list. The function also updates the colors of the nodes it visits, marking them as visited (color 1) or fully explored (color 2).**
