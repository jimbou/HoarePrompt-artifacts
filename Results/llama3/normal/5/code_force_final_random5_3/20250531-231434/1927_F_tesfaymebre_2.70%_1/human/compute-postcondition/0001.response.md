According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`, which is unknown. So for the loop to be executed, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0**
