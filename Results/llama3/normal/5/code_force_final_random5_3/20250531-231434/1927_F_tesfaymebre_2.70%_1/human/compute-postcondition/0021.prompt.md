Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: curr is a non-negative integer, parent is a non-negative integer, path is a list of non-negative integers that includes the current node (curr), graph is a dictionary where each key is a non-negative integer and each value is a list of non-negative integers, colors is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph where the color of the current node (colors[curr]) is 1, and node_v is a non-negative integer.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *curr is a non-negative integer, parent is a non-negative integer, path is a list of non-negative integers that includes the current node (curr), graph is a dictionary where each key is a non-negative integer and each value is a list of non-negative integers, colors is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph where the color of the current node (colors[curr]) is 1, node_v is a non-negative integer, nei is the first neighbor in the list, res is a list of integers, set_res is a set of integers. If colors[nei] is not equal to 2 and nei is not equal to parent, then the list res is empty or node_v is not in set_res. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *curr, parent, node_v are non-negative integers, path is a list of non-negative integers that includes the current node (curr), graph is a dictionary where each key is a non-negative integer and each value is a list of non-negative integers, colors is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph where the color of the current node (colors[curr]) is 1. If colors[nei] is not equal to 2 and nei is not equal to parent, then either the program returns a list of integers (res) that contains the results of the dfs function, where each integer in the list corresponds to a node in the graph, and the list is also contained in a set (set_res) for efficient lookups, or it continues executing the next part of the program if the list is empty or the current node is not in the set of results. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *curr, parent, node_v are non-negative integers, path is a list of non-negative integers that includes the current node (curr), graph is a dictionary where each key is a non-negative integer and each value is a list of non-negative integers that has at least 2 elements, colors is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph where the color of the current node (colors[curr]) is 1, nei is the second element in the list of graph[curr]. If colors[nei] is not equal to 2 and nei is not equal to parent, then if res is not empty and node_v is in set_res, the function returns a list of integers 'res' that contains some values but the exact values are not specified in the initial state, however, it is known that 'res' is related to the graph, colors, and the current node 'curr' with color 1. Otherwise, the function does not return any value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
