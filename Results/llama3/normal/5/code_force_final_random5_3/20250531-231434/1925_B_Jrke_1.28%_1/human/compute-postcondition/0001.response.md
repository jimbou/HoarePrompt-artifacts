Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x), _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of x and n are within their specified ranges, and k is calculated as the integer division of x by n. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each with two integers x and n, as one line has been consumed by the input operation. The value of _ remains unchanged at 0.
