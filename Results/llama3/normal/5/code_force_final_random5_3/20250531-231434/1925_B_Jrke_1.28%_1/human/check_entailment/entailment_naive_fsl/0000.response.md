Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is x = 6 and n = 3. The maximum balance that Yash can achieve is 2, but the program outputs 1.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for factors of x that are less than or equal to the square root of x. However, it does not consider the case where the factor is greater than the square root of x. In the case of x = 6 and n = 3, the factor 3 is greater than the square root of 6, and therefore the program does not consider it.

To fix this issue, the program should check for all factors of x, not just those that are less than or equal to the square root of x.
