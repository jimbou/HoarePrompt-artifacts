Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 1 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `i`. `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 4. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `i`. `ans` is the maximum value in `l`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `l`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2 and its square root must be greater than or equal to 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise its square root must be greater than or equal to 6, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 6, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `i`. `ans` is the maximum value in `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum value in `l` and `ans` is now equal to `max(l)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
