Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`), `_` is 0. If `k` is 1, we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been initialized to 1. The other variables `x`, `n`, `k`, and `_` retain their previous values and conditions. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input. The condition for skipping the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop based on the value of `k` remains the same.
