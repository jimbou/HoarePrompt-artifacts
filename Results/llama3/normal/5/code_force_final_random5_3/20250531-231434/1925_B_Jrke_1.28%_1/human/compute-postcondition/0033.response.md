Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either 5 or 7 and `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `x // i`, `_` is 0, `i` is either 5 or 7, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains either two or three elements, depending on whether `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input.
