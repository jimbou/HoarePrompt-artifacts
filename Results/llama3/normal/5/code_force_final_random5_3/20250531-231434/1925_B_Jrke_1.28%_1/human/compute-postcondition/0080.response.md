Postcondition: ***x is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is the maximum value in the list l containing the values of ans, i, and x // i if x // i is less than or equal to k, otherwise l is a list containing only the value of ans and i, and the loop has executed one less time. If k equals 1, then 1 is printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.***
