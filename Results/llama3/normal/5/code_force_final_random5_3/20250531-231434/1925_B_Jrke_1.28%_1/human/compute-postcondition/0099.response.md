Output State: **`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `ans`, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x` divided by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains the current value of `ans`, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
