Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`), `_` is 0, i is 2. The current value of `x` is divisible by 2. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the list `l` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, and the current value of `x` is still divisible by 2. The current value of `i` is still less than or equal to `k`.
