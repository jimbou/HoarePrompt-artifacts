Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 4. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `i`. `ans` is the maximum value in `l`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `l`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
