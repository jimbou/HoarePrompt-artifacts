Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing three values: the maximum value in `l`, `i`, and `x // i`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l` which is either the previous maximum value, `i`, or `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remains unchanged. The list `l` now contains three values: the maximum value it had before, the value of `i`, and the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`, which can be either the previous maximum value, the value of `i`, or the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`.
