To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `k`.

1. `i`: The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 2. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, the next value of `i` will be 3 or 4.

2. `x`: The value of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

3. `k`: The value of `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. Since `n` is not modified in the loop head, the value of `k` remains the same.

The other variables, `ans`, `l`, and `n`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is also the maximum of the current value of `i`. `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains an additional element which is the current value of `i`.**
