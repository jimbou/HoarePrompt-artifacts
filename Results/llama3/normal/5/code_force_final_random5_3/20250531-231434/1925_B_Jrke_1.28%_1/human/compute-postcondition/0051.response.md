Postcondition: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` and `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`. `i` is 1 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 2. The current value of `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
