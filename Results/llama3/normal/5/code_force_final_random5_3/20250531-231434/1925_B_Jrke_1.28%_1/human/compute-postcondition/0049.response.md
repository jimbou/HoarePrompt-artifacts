Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` and `i`, `i` is 1 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 2. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to the current value of `k`.**

In this output state, the list `l` now contains two elements: the initial value of `ans` (which is 1) and the current value of `i` (which is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `x` is odd or even). The other variables remain unchanged.
