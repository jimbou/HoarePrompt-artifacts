Postcondition: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is 1 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 2. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**
