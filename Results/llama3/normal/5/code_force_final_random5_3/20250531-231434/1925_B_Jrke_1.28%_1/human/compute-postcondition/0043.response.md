Postcondition: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `k` is 1, then `i` is `int(x)`, `_` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
