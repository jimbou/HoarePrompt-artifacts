Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2 and its square root must be greater than or equal to 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise its square root must be greater than or equal to 6, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 6, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l` which is `i` since `i` is greater than or equal to `ans`**.

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is either 5 or 6 depending on whether `x` is odd or even. The value of `ans` has also been updated to be the maximum value in `l`, which is now `i` since `i` is greater than or equal to the original value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
