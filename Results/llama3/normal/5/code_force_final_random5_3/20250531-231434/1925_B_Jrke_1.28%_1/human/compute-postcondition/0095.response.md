Output State: **`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is also the maximum of the current value of `i`. `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` is appended to the list `l`, so `l` now contains two elements: the original value of `ans` and the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
