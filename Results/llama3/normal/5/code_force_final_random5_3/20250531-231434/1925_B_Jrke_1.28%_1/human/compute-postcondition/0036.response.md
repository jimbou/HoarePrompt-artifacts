The code prints the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. The value of `i` is `int(x**0.5)`, which is the integer square root of `x`. The value of `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive. The value of `x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive.

Output: **the maximum value in the list l (where l is a list containing the value of ans and either i or x // i if i is less than or equal to k and x is divisible by i, otherwise l is a list containing only the value of ans and x // i if x is divisible by i, otherwise l is a list containing only the value of ans and either i or x // i if x // i is less than or equal to k)**
