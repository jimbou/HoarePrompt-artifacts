Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is either 1, 2, or the integer division of `x` by 2, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `_` is 0, `i` is either 4 or 5, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be a list containing the value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `ans` is still dependent on whether `x` is divisible by 2 or not. If `x` is divisible by 2, `ans` is either 2 or the integer division of `x` by 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.
