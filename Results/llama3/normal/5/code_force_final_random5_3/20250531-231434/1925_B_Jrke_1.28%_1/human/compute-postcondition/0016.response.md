Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1. If `x` divided by 2 is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and the integer division of `x` by 2. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 2. stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`), `_` is 0, `i` is 2.***
