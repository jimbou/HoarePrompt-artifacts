Postcondition: ***x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x), _ is 0. If k is 1, we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the code continues to execute.***
