Output State: **`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is also the maximum of the current value of `i`. `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to contain only the value of `ans`, which is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is also the maximum of the current value of `i`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
