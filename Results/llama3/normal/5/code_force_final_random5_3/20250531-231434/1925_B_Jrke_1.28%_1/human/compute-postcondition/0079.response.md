Output State: **x is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is the maximum value in the list l containing the values of ans, i, and x // i if x // i is less than or equal to k, otherwise l is a list containing only the value of ans and i, and the loop has executed one less time, and 1 is printed, and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the loop has executed one less time, and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.
