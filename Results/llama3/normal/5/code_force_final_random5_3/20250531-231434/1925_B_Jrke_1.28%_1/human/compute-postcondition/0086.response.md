Output State: **`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, the current value of `i` is less than or equal to the current value of `k`, and `l` contains an additional element which is the current value of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the initial conditions are still valid, and the list `l` now contains an additional element, which is the current value of `i` (either 1 or 2).
