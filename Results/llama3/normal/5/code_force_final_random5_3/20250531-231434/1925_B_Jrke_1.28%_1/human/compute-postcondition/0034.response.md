Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either 5 or 7 and `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and either 4 or 5 if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `_` is 0, `i` is either 5 or 7, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`).***
