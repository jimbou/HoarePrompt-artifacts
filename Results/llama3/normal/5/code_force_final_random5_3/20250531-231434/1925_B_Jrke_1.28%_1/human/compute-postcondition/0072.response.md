Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` containing the values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `i`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` containing the values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `i`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
