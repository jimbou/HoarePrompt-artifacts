The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 4, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`), `_` is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the `x` must be at least 4 and the i is 2.
State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`), `_` is 0, i is 2**
