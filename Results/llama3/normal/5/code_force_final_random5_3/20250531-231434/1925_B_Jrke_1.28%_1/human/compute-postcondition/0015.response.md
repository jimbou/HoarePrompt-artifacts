Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and the integer division of `x` by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`), `_` is 0, `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the integer division of `x` by 2, which is a new element appended to the list. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 lines of input. The current value of `x` is still divisible by 2, and the integer division of `x` by `i` (which is 2) is still less than or equal to `k`.
