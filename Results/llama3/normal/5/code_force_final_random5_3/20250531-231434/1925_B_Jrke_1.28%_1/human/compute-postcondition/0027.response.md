State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is either the maximum value between the integer division of `x` by 2 and either 4 or 5 if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum value between the integer division of `x` by 2 and the integer division of `x` by `i` if `x // i` is greater than `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either 4 or 5 if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, or a list containing only the value of `ans` and the integer division of `x` by `i` if `x // i` is greater than `k`, `_` is 0, `i` is either 5 or 7, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`).**
