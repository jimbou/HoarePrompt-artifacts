Output State: **x is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is the maximum value in the list l, l is a list containing the value of ans and either i or x // i if i is less than or equal to k and x is divisible by i, otherwise l is a list containing only the value of ans and x // i if x is divisible by i, otherwise l is a list containing only the value of ans and either i or x // i if x // i is less than or equal to k, _ is 1, i is int(x**0.5), stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of two integers**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `n`. Since `x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, the values of `x` and `n` are updated. The second line assigns the integer division of `x` by `n` to `k`. Since `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, the value of `k` is updated. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
