Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been reset to 1. The values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain the same. The list `l` still contains the value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i` depending on the conditions, but the value of `ans` is now 1.
