Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, the loop has executed one less time. If `k` equals 1, then 1 is printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is also the maximum of the current value of `i`. `i` is either 1 or 2. `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains an additional element which is the current value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is also the maximum of the current value of `i`. `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains an additional element which is the current value of `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `ans`, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Also, if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x` divided by `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is either 5 or 6, `ans` is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is also the maximum of the current value of `i`. `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains an additional element which is the current value of `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `ans`, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Also, if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x` divided by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains an additional element which is the value of `i`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` also contains the integer division of `x` by `i`. `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
