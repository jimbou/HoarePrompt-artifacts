Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1. `i` is 1 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 2. `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.**

The code appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is 1 if `x` is odd and 2 if `x` is even, the value of `x // i` will be either `x` (if `x` is odd) or `x // 2` (if `x` is even). The list `l` now contains three elements: `ans` (which is 1), `i` (which is either 1 or 2), and `x // i` (which is either `x` or `x // 2`). The other variables remain unchanged.
