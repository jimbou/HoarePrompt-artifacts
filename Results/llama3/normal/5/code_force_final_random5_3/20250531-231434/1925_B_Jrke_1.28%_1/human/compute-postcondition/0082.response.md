To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and the range parameters.

1. `i` is the loop variable, and its initial value is determined by the expression `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`. This means `i` will be either 1 or 2, depending on whether `x` is even or odd.
2. `x` is used in the range parameters, specifically in the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. This means `x` must be a positive integer, as the square root of a negative number or zero would not produce a valid range.

Considering the given state before the loop starts:

* `x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive.
* `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive.
* `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`.
* `ans` is 1, and the loop has executed one less time.

We can adjust the states as follows:

* `i` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `x` is even or odd.
* `x` must be a positive integer, and its square root must be an integer (i.e., `x` is a perfect square).

The adjusted state is:

State: **`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is either 1 or 2**
