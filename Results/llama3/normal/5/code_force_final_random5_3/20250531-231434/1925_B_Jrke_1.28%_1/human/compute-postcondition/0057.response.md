Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 4. `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be a list containing only the value of `ans`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `l` now only contains one element, which is the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is the maximum value in this list, which is simply the value of `ans` itself.
