The code prints the maximum value in the list `l` which is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the maximum value is also the maximum of the current value of `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the maximum value is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `ans`, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Also, if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the maximum value also includes the value of `x` divided by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the maximum value includes an additional element which is the value of `i`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the maximum value also includes the integer division of `x` by `i`. The maximum value is the maximum value in the list `l`.
Output: ** `x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is equal to the square root of `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is also the maximum of the current value of `i`. `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is the maximum of 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains an additional element which is the current value of `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `ans`, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Also, if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x` divided by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains an additional element which is the value of `i`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` also contains the integer division of `x` by `i`. `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`, and the maximum value in the list `l` is being printed**
