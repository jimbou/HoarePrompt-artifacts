Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x), _ is 0, and we skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of x, n, k, and _ remain the same as before. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input. However, due to the continue statement, the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the program moves on to the next iteration.
