Output State: **`x` is a perfect square between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the integer division of `x` by `i`, in addition to the initial value of `ans` which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
