Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is either 1, 2, or the integer division of `x` by 2, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and either 4 or 5, `_` is 0, `i` is either 4 or 5, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, and `n` remains between 1 and `x` inclusive. The value of `k` is still the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `ans` is still either 1, 2, or the integer division of `x` by 2. The list `l` now contains the value of `ans` and either 4 or 5. The value of `_` remains 0. The value of `i` is still either 4 or 5. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`).
