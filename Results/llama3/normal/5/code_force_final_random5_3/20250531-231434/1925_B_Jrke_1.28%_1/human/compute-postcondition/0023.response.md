Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is either 1, 2, or the integer division of `x` by 2, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, either 4 or 5, and the integer division of `x` by `i`, `_` is 0, `i` is either 4 or 5, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`).**

In this output state, the list `l` now contains an additional element, which is the integer division of `x` by `i`. The value of `i` is either 4 or 5, so the new element in the list `l` is either `x // 4` or `x // 5`. The other variables remain unchanged.
