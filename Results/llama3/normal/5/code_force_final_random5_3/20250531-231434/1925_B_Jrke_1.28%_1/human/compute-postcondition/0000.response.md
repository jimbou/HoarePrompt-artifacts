The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If the expression evaluates to at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x). So for the loop to be executed, the expression `int(input())` must evaluate to at least 1 and `_` is 0.
