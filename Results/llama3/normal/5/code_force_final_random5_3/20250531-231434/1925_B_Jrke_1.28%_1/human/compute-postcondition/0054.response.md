Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 1 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and `i`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains either the values of `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, or only the values of `ans` and `i` if `x // i` is greater than `k`. The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.
