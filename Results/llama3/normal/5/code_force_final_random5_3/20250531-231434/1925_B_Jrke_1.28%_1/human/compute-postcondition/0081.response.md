Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, the loop has executed one less time. If `k` equals 1, then 1 is printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 1. The values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The loop has executed one less time, and if `k` equals 1, then 1 is printed and the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration is skipped, moving to the next iteration.
