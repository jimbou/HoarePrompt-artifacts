Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2 and its square root must be greater than or equal to 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise its square root must be greater than or equal to 6, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 6, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.**

In this output state, the list `l` has been updated to contain only the value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The value of `ans` is now the maximum value in the updated list `l`, which only contains `ans` itself.
