Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive and at least 2 and its square root must be greater than or equal to 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise its square root must be greater than or equal to 6, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 6, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` and also the value of `x // i`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l` which is `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum value in `l` and `ans` is now equal to `max(l)`**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `ans` is now equal to the maximum value in the list `l`. The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` remain the same as in the initial state.
