Output State: **`x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8) and `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ `x`), `_` is 0, i is 2. The current value of `x` is divisible by 2**

In this output state, a new list `l` has been created and initialized with the value of `ans`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 lines of input. The value of `x` is still divisible by 2.
