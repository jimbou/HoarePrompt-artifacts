Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `x1` is equal to `x4`, `x3` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is not less than `y2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, stdin is empty, either `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, and either `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `x3` is not equal to `x4`.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables retain their initial values except for `res`, which is now assigned the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. The conditions that `x1` is equal to `x4`, `x3` is equal to `x2`, `y1` is not less than `y2`, and the constraints on the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are still valid.
