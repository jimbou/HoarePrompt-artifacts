The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `stdin` contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers. If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, or `x1` equals `x4` and `x3` equals `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, and the square of `res` is printed**
