Postcondition: **a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin is empty. The current values of x1, x2, x3, and x4 are such that x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4. The current value of y1 is less than y3.**
