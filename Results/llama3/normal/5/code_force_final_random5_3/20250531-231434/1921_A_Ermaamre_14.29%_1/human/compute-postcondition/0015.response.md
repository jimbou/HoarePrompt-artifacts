Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, stdin is empty. If y1 is less than y2, res is a positive integer equal to y2 - y1. If y1 is greater than or equal to y2, res is equal to y1 - y2.***
