Output State: **a is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is equal to a, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin is empty. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, or x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2, and the square of res is printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable 'i' is equal to the initial value of 'a'. The input from stdin has been fully consumed, and the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 hold the last set of input values. The value of 'res' is the absolute difference between y1 and y3 if x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, or the absolute difference between y1 and y2 if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, or x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2. The square of 'res' is printed for each test case.
