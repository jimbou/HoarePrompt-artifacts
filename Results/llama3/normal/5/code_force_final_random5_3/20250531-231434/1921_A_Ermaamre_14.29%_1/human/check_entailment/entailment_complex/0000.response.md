Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the area of the square by determining the length of its side, which is the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of two opposite corners. The program handles all possible orientations of the square (i.e., when x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, when x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, and when x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2) and prints the area (side length squared) for each test case.

The program also correctly reads the input from standard input, processes all test cases, and leaves the standard input empty upon completion.

Correctness: **True**
