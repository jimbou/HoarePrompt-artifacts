Postcondition: **a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), x1 is equal to x4, x3 is equal to x2, either x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4, and either x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4, stdin is empty. If y1 is less than y2, res is equal to the absolute difference between y2 and y1. Otherwise, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2.**
