Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`, stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is now the absolute difference between the values of `y3` and `y1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains four pairs of space-separated integers as input.
