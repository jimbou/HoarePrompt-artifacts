Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` test cases, each test case consisting of four lines, each line containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin is empty. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then if y1 is less than y3, res is a positive integer equal to y3 - y1. If y1 is not less than y3, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If x1 does not equal x3 or x2 does not equal x4, then if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, then if y1 is less than y2, res is a positive integer equal to y2 - y1. If y1 is greater than or equal to y2, res is equal to y1 - y2. If either x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4, then if x1 is equal to x4 and x3 is equal to x2, then if y1 is less than y2, res is equal to the absolute difference between y2 and y1. Otherwise, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2, and the square of res is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, or x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2, and the square of res is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin is empty. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1 if y1 is less than y3, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, then res is a non-negative integer (0 <= res <= 2000). If x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1 if y1 is less than y2, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2, and the square of res is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
