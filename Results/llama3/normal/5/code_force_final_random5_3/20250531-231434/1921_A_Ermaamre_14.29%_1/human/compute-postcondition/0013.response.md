Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin is empty, x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4. The current values of x1, x2, x3, and x4 are such that x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4. y1 is greater than or equal to y2***
