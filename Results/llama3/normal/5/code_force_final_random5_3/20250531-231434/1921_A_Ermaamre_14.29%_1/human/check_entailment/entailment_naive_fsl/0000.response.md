Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39

The program will output:

9
4
784

However, if the input is:

2
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1

The program will not work correctly because it assumes that the first two points are always on the same horizontal line, which is not the case in this example.

A correct solution would be to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, and then calculate the area of the square using the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates.

Here is a correct implementation:

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for j in range(4):
            points.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
        min_x = min(point[0] for point in points)
        max_x = max(point[0] for point in points)
        min_y = min(point[1] for point in points)
        max_y = max(point[1] for point in points)
        res = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y)
        print(res ** 2)

This implementation first reads all four points, then finds the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. It then calculates the area of the square using the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates.
