Postcondition: **a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin is empty. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then if y1 is less than y3, res is a positive integer equal to y3 - y1. If y1 is not less than y3, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If x1 does not equal x3 or x2 does not equal x4, then if x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, then if y1 is less than y2, res is a positive integer equal to y2 - y1. If y1 is greater than or equal to y2, res is equal to y1 - y2. If either x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4, then if x1 is equal to x4 and x3 is equal to x2, then if y1 is less than y2, res is equal to the absolute difference between y2 and y1. Otherwise, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2.**
