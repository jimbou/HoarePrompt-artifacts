The code prints the square of the absolute difference between two pairs of y-coordinates, depending on the conditions met by the x-coordinates. The x-coordinates and y-coordinates are read from the standard input as four pairs of space-separated integers.

Output: **the square of the absolute difference between two pairs of y-coordinates (where the pairs are determined by the conditions met by the x-coordinates)**
