Output: **a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin is empty. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1 if y1 is less than y3, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, then res is a non-negative integer (0 <= res <= 2000). If x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1 if y1 is less than y2, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2, and the square of res is printed**
