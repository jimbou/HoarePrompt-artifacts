Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. It assumes that the input coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

The program works by first reading the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square. It checks the x-coordinates of the corners to determine which two corners are opposite each other (i.e., have the same x-coordinate). It then calculates the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of these two opposite corners, which gives the length of the side of the square. Finally, it prints the area of the square, which is the square of the side length.

The program handles all possible orientations of the square by checking all possible pairs of opposite corners. It also handles cases where the y-coordinates of the opposite corners are in either order (i.e., y1 < y3 or y1 > y3).

The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty upon completion.

Correctness: **True**
