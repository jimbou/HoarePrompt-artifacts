Postcondition: **a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers. If x1 equals x3 and x2 equals x4, then res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3. If x1 equals x2 and x3 equals x4, or x1 equals x4 and x3 equals x2, then res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2.**
