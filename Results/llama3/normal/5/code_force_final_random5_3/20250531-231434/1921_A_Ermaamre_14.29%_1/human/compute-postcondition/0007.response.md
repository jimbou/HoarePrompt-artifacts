Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, `y1` is not less than `y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`**.

In this output state, the value of `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`, which means it is the positive difference between the two values, regardless of their order. The other variables remain unchanged, with `a` still being an integer between 1 and 100, `i` still being 0, and the other variables still being integers within the specified range. The relationships between `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` are also preserved, with `x1` equal to `x3` and `x2` equal to `x4`. Additionally, `y1` is still not less than `y3`.
