This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four lines representing the coordinates of a square's corners. It calculates the area of each square by determining the length of its side, which is the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of two opposite corners, and prints the area (side length squared) for each test case. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty upon completion.
