The code reads four lines of input from stdin, each containing two integers x and y. The values of x and y are assigned to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4, respectively. The initial values of a and i are not modified by the code.

Output State: **a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin is empty**
