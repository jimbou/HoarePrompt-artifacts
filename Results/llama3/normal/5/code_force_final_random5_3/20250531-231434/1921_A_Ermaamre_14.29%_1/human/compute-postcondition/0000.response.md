The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `a`. In the initial state, the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each line containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

After executing the code, the value of `a` is assigned the value of the first integer `t` from the standard input. The remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases, each with four lines of two integers, is still present in the standard input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` test cases, each test case consisting of four lines, each line containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000).**
