Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is a positive integer equal to `y2 - y1`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain the same as in the initial state. The new variable `res` is introduced, which is assigned the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Since `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is equal to `y2 - y1`, which is a positive integer. The stdin remains empty.
