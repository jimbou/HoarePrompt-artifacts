Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin is empty, either x1 is not equal to x3 or x2 is not equal to x4, and either x1 is not equal to x2 or x3 is not equal to x4. Additionally, the current values of x1 and x4 are equal, and the current values of x3 and x2 are equal. y1 is not less than y2***
