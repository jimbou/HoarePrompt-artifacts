Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `res` is equal to `y1 - y2` because `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is calculated as the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, which is simply `y1 - y2` because `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
