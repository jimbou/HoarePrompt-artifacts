Output State: **a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, which means it is the non-negative difference between the two values. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged, and the stdin is still empty.
