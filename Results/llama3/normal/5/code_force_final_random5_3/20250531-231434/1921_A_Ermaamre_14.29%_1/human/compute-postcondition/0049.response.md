Output State: **a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), res is a non-negative integer (0 <= res <= 2000), stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, which are integers between -1000 and 1000. Therefore, `res` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 2000. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
