Output State: **a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, which means it is the distance between the y-coordinates of two points. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains four pairs of space-separated integers.
