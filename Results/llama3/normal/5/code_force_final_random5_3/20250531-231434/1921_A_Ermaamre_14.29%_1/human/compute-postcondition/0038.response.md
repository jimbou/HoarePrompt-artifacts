Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers.***
