Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, which means it is the non-negative difference between the two values. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and stdin is still empty.
