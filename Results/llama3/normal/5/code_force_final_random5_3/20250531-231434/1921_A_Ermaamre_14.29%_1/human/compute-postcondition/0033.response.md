Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `res` is assigned the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, which means it will hold a non-negative integer value representing the distance between the y-coordinates of two points. The stdin still contains four pairs of space-separated integers as input.
