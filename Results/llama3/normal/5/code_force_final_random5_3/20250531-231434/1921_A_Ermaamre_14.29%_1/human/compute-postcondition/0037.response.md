Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is calculated as the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, which means it will be a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains four pairs of space-separated integers, as no input operation was performed in the given code.
