Output State: **a is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, i is 2, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`, which means it is the positive difference between these two values, regardless of their order. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
