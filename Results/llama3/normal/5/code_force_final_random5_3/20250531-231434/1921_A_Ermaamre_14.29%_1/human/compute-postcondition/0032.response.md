Postcondition: ***a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers. If y1 is less than y3, res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1. Otherwise, res is the absolute difference between y1 and y3.***
