Based on the precondition, we can analyze the possible values of `res` and then determine what will be printed.

The precondition states that:

* If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y3`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
* If `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, then `res` is a non-negative integer (0 <= `res` <= 2000).
* If `x1` equals `x4` and `x3` equals `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.

Since we don't have explicit values for `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4`, we can't determine the exact value of `res`. However, we can describe the possible values of `res` based on the given conditions.

The `print` statement will print the square of `res`, which means it will print a non-negative integer value.

Output: **a non-negative integer value (0 <= res^2 <= 4000000)**
