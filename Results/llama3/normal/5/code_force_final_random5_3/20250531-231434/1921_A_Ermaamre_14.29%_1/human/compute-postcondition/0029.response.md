Output State: **a is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, i is 1, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), stdin contains 4 inputs: four pairs of space-separated integers.**

The code block reads four pairs of integers from stdin and assigns them to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4, respectively. The values of these variables are now integers between -1000 and 1000, inclusive. The variables a and i remain unchanged, with a being an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, and i being 1. Stdin now contains four pairs of space-separated integers.
