Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `x1` equals `x3`, `x2` equals `x4`, `y1` is less than `y3`, `res` is a positive integer equal to `y3 - y1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain the same as in the initial state. Additionally, a new variable `res` is introduced, which is a positive integer equal to the difference between `y3` and `y1`. The relationship between `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` remains the same, with `x1` equal to `x3` and `x2` equal to `x4`. The relationship between `y1` and `y3` also remains the same, with `y1` being less than `y3`.
