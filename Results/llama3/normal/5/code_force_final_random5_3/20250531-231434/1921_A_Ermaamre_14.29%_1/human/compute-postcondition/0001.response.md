The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 0, stdin contains `a` test cases, each test case consisting of four lines, each line containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000)**
