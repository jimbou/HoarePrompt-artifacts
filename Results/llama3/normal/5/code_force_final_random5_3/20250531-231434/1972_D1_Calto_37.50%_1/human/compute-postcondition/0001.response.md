According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `m` are positive integers and `cnt` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is at least 2 and `i` is now 1. 
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `cnt` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
