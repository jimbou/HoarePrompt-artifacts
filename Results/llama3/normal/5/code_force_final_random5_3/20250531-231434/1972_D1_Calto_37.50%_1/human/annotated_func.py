#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original 'a' and 'b'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, 'a' and 'b', modifying the original values of 'a' and 'b' in the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, cnt is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the sum of (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1) for all i from 1 to m-1, i is m-1, x is n - ((m-1) * (m-1) - (m-1)), y is (m-1) * (m-1)
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the number 1
    #State: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, cnt is a positive integer and is not equal to 0, cnt is equal to its original value plus the sum of (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1) for all i from 1 to m-1, i is m-1, x is n - ((m-1) * (m-1) - (m-1)), y is (m-1) * (m-1)
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt which is a positive integer and is equal to its original value plus the sum of (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1) for all i from 1 to m-1, where n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, and i is m-1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates a count based on the input parameters n and m, which are positive integers. It iterates from 1 to m-1, calculating a value x as n minus the difference between the square of the current iteration i and i itself, and a value y as the square of i. The count is incremented by the integer division of x by y plus 1 if i is greater than 1. If the final count is 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated count. The function effectively performs a mathematical operation on the input parameters n and m, resulting in a count that depends on their values.
