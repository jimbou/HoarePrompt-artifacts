To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` is a positive integer and at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `m` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `n`, `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 4, `cnt` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus (n - (2 * 2 - 2)) // (2 * 2) + (2 > 1), `i` is 3, `x` is n - (2 * 2 - 2), `y` is 2 * 2**
