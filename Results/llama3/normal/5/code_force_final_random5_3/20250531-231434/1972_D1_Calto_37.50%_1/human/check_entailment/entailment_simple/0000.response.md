Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 1 correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

Function 2 attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs. However, it contains a logical error. The loop iterates from 1 to m-1, but it should iterate from 1 to m (inclusive) because the problem statement specifies 1 ≤ b ≤ m. This means that the function is missing the case where b = m.

Additionally, the function uses the variable `cnt` to accumulate the count of valid pairs, but it does not correctly calculate the count. The expression `x // y + (i > 1)` is not a correct representation of the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
