Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for values of `i` up to `m-1`, but it should check for all values of `i` up to `m`. This is because the condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)` can be satisfied for `i` equal to `m` as well.

For example, if `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program will not count the pair `(10, 8)` which satisfies the condition. This is because `i` only goes up to `7` in the loop, and `8` is not checked.

To fix this issue, the loop should be changed to `for i in range(1, m+1):`. This will ensure that all possible values of `i` are checked, and the program will produce the correct output for all test cases.
