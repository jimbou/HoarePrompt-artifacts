Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer and at least 2, cnt is a positive integer equal to its original value plus (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1), i is 1, x is n - (i * i - i), y is i * i**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `cnt` is incremented by the result of the expression `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)`, which depends on the original value of `n` and the value of `i`. The value of `i` remains 1 as it is not modified by the code. The values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the values of `n` and `i`.
