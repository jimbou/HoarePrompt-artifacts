The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 3, `cnt` is a positive integer equal to its original value plus (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1), `i` is 2, `x` is n - (i * i - i), `y` is i * i**
