Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer and at least 3, cnt is a positive integer equal to its original value plus (n - (2 * 2 - 2)) // (2 * 2) + (2 > 1), i is 2, x is n - (2 * 2 - 2), y is 2 * 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `cnt` is incremented by the expression `(n - (2 * 2 - 2)) // (2 * 2) + (2 > 1)`, which is equivalent to `(n - 2) // 4 + 1`. The value of `x` is updated to `n - (2 * 2 - 2)`, which is equivalent to `n - 2`. The value of `y` is updated to `2 * 2`, which is equivalent to `4`.
