The only variables in the loop head are variables  y and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If x is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is at least 3 and y is now x-1. 
State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is x-1, `max_val` is 1**
