Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible.

The given program defines a function func_1(x) that iterates over the range from x-1 to 2 (inclusive) in reverse order. For each y in this range, it checks if x is divisible by y (i.e., x % y == 0). If it is, and 2*y is greater than or equal to x, it returns y immediately. Otherwise, it updates the max_val variable to the current y.

The function then returns the max_val, which is the optimal y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads an integer x and calls func_1(x) to find the optimal y. It then prints the result.

The program's logic is correct because it iterates over the possible values of y in reverse order, which ensures that it finds the maximum possible gcd(x, y) + y. The condition 2*y >= x is used to prune the search space, as any y that satisfies this condition will have a gcd(x, y) + y that is at least as large as the maximum possible value.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
