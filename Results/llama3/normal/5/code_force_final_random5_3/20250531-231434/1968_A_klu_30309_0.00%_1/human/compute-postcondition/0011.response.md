To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate over the values of `y` from `x - 1` down to `1` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `x` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is `x - 2`, and `max_val` is 1.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop will execute again if `y` is still within the range defined by the loop head.

Since `y` is `x - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to decrement `y` by 1 to get the next value of `y` in the range. Therefore, the new value of `y` should be `x - 3`.

The value of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The value of `max_val` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `y` is `x - 3`, `max_val` is 1**
