To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):`, which means that `y` is the variable being iterated over, and its value is decreasing by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is x-1, and `max_val` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, the condition `y > 1` must be true, since the `range` function generates values from `x - 1` down to 1 (exclusive).

Since `y` is decreasing by 1 in each iteration, we can infer that at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `x - 2`.

The value of `x` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop.

The value of `max_val` is not relevant to the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `y` is x-2, `max_val` is 1**
