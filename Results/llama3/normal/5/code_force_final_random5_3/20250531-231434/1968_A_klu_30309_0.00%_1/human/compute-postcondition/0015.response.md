Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x/2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `x` remains unchanged, and `max_val` is updated to be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than half of `x`. If no such divisor is found, `max_val` remains 1.
