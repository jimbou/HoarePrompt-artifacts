Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, s is a binary string of size n, cnt1 is the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, this line reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line reads a binary string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The third line counts the number of '1's in `s` and assigns it to `cnt1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
