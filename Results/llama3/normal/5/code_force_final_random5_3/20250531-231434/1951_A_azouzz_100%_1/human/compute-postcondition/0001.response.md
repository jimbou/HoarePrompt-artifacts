To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of one line. The line contains a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50), `_` is 0**
