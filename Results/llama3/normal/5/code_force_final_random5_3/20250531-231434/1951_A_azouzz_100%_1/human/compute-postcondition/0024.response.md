Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, s is a binary string of size n, cnt1 is the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is odd and greater than 2, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is less than or equal to 2, then if cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if s contains the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
