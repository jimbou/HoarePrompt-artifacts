Output State: **_ is incremented by 1 from its previous value, t remains the same, n is an integer, s is a string, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in s, and stdin contains no input.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`. The third line assigns the count of '1' characters in `s` to `cnt1`. The variables `_` and `t` are not directly affected by the code and thus remain as described in the initial state. Stdin is emptied after the two input operations.
