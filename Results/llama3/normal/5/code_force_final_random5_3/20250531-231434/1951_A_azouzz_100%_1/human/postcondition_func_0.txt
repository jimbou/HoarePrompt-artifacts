This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then checks the number of '1' characters in the binary string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions: if the count is more than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count is more than 2 and odd, it prints 'NO'; if the count is 1, it prints 'NO'; and if the count is 2, it prints 'NO' if the string contains '11', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
