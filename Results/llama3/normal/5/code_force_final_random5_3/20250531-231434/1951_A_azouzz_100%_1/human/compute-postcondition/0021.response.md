Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, s is a binary string of size n, cnt1 is the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, cnt1 is either less than or equal to 2 or cnt1 is odd, and cnt1 is less than or equal to 2, and cnt1 is not equal to 1. If the current value of s contains the substring '11', then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed.***
