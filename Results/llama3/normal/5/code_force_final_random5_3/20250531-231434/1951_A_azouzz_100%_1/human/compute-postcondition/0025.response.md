To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `_` (or more meaningfully, the loop counter) and `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `_` has completed one iteration, so it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur. The variable `t` remains unchanged because it is the total number of iterations the loop is supposed to run, and its value does not change based on the loop's progress.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment `_` by 1. Since `_` is a counter variable in a `range(t)` loop, it starts from 0 and goes up to `t-1`. Thus, if the previous iteration ended with `_` being some value, for the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented.

However, since the problem statement does not explicitly mention the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only describe the adjustment in terms of the requirement for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`, and since it increments by 1 each time, the condition for the next iteration is that `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the original state description does not specify the exact value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll describe the adjustment in a general form:

State: **`_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` remains the same, and other variables (`n`, `s`, `cnt1`, and the state of `stdin`) are not directly affected by the loop head and thus remain as described.**

However, since we are to follow a specific format and the original problem does not specify the exact value of `_` to increment from, we cannot provide a numerical value for `_` in the final state description. The task seems to require a numerical adjustment based on the loop counter's progression, but without a specific starting point for `_`, we can only describe the change conceptually.
