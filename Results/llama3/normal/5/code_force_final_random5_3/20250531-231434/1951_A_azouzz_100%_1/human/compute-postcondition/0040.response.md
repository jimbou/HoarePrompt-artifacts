Postcondition: **_ is incremented by 1 from its previous value, t remains the same, n is an integer, s is a string, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in s, and stdin contains no input. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
