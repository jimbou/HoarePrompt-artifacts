Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of one line. The line contains a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2:
        print('NO')
    elif cnt1 == 1:
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, s is a binary string of size n, cnt1 is the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is odd and greater than 2, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is less than or equal to 2, then if cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if s contains the substring '11', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is incremented by 1 from its previous value, t remains the same, n is an integer, s is a string, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in s, and stdin contains no input. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_ is incremented by 1 from its previous value, t remains the same, n is an integer equal to the input value, s is a string equal to the input string, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in s, and stdin contains no input. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
