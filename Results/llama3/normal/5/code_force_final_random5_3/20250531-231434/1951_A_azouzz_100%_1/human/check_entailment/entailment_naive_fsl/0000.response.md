Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether a given configuration of lamps can be reached by turning on non-adjacent lamps. The logic is as follows:

- If the number of lamps to be turned on (cnt1) is greater than 2 and even, it is possible to reach the configuration by turning on pairs of non-adjacent lamps.
- If cnt1 is greater than 2 but odd, it is not possible to reach the configuration because there will always be one lamp left that cannot be turned on.
- If cnt1 is 1, it is not possible to reach the configuration because there are no pairs of non-adjacent lamps to turn on.
- If the string '11' is present in the configuration, it means that two adjacent lamps need to be turned on, which is not possible according to the problem statement.
- In all other cases, the configuration can be reached.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
