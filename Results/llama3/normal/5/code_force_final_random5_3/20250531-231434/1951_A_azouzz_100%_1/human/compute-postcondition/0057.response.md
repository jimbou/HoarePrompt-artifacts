Output State: **_ is equal to t, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, s is a binary string of size n, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in s, and stdin contains no input. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is more than 2 and cnt1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is 2, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. The values of `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` will be the same as in the previous iteration, and the standard input `stdin` will be empty. The output will be determined by the same conditions as before, depending on the value of `cnt1` and the presence of the substring '11' in `s`.
