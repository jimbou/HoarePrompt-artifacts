Postcondition: **_ is incremented by 1 from its previous value, t remains the same, n is an integer, s is a string, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in s, and stdin contains no input. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is not 1, then if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
