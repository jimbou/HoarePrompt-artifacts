Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of one line. The line contains a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now consists of only one line, which contains a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= n <= 50).
