Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of positive integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether a subarray within the list can be transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers by replacing some elements with 1. The function prints 'YES' if such a transformation is possible and 'NO' otherwise.**
