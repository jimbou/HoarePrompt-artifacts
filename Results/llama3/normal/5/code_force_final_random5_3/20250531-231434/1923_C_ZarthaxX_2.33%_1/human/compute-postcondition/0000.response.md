Output State: **n is an integer, q is an integer, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of zeros with length n + 1, sum is a list of zeros with length n + 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with reduced input.**

The code executes the following operations:

1. `n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))`: This line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `q`, respectively. The value of `n` is the number of test cases, and the value of `q` is the number of queries.

2. `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))`: This line reads a list of positive integers from the input and assigns it to `nums`. The length of `nums` is equal to `n`.

3. `ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]`: This line creates a list of zeros with length `n + 1` and assigns it to `ones`.

4. `sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]`: This line creates a list of zeros with length `n + 1` and assigns it to `sum`.

After executing these lines, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
* `q` is an integer representing the number of queries.
* `nums` is a list of positive integers with length `n`.
* `ones` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
* `sum` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
* Stdin contains multiple test cases with reduced input, as some inputs have already been read and processed.

Note that the code does not modify the values of `n`, `q`, or `nums` after they are initialized. The lists `ones` and `sum` are initialized with zeros and do not change during the execution of the code.
