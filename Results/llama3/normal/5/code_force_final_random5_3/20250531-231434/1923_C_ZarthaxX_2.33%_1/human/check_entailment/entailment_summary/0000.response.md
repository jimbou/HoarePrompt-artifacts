Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the cumulative count of ones and the cumulative sum of the input array `nums`, respectively, minus one. This is done to efficiently calculate the number of ones and the sum of the subarray for each query.

2.  For each query, the program checks if the left and right indices are the same. If they are, it prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers by replacing some elements with 1.

3.  If the left and right indices are not the same, the program calculates the number of ones in the subarray (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray (`sumInRange`).

4.  The program then checks if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the number of ones in the subarray plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones in the subarray. This condition ensures that there are enough elements in the subarray that can be replaced with 1 to make the subarray a sequence of consecutive integers.

5.  If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently handles the queries by using the precomputed `ones` and `sum` arrays.

Correctness: **True**
