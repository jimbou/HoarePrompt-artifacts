Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of positive integers, `ones` is a list of integers where `ones[i]` is equal to `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise `ones[i]` is equal to `ones[i - 1]`, `sum` is a list of integers where `sum[i]` is equal to `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]` minus 1, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to `ones[r]` minus `ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to `sum[r]` minus `sum[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `r` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, and 'NO' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and 'NO' is still printed.
