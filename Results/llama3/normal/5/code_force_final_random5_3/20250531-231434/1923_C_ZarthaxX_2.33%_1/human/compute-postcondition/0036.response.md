Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of positive integers, `ones` is a list of integers where `ones[i]` is equal to `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise `ones[i]` is equal to `ones[i - 1]`, `sum` is a list of integers where `sum[i]` is equal to `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]` minus 1, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to `ones[r]` minus `ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to `sum[r]` minus `sum[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `r` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the integers from the input. The values of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are not updated because they depend on the values of `l` and `r`, which have changed. The stdin is now empty because it has been used to read the input for `l` and `r`.
