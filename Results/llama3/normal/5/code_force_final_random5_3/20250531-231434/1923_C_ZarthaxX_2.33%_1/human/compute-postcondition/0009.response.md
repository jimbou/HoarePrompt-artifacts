Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of positive integers, `ones` is a list of integers where `ones[i]` is equal to `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise `ones[i]` is equal to `ones[i - 1]`, `sum` is a list of integers where `sum[i]` is equal to `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]` minus 1, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases with reduced input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` remain unchanged. The code only affects the values of `l` and `r`, which are assigned the values of two integers from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with reduced input.
