Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with reduced input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer greater than 0, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] minus ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] minus sum[l - 1]. If 2 times onesInRange plus the difference between r and l plus 1 minus onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer greater than 0, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] minus ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] minus sum[l - 1], l is an integer, r is an integer. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer greater than 0, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] minus ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] minus sum[l - 1], l is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
