Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is 3, q is an integer, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 0, sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with reduced input.**

The code modifies the values of `ones[i]` and `sum[i]` based on the values of `nums[i - 1]`. The value of `ones[i]` is incremented by 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as `ones[i - 1]`. The value of `sum[i]` is calculated by adding `nums[i - 1]` to `sum[i - 1]` and then subtracting 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `q`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with reduced input.
