The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, q must be decreased by 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer greater than 0, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] minus ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] minus sum[l - 1], l is an integer, r is an integer. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.**
