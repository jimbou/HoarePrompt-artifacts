To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `q` is an integer, `nums` is a list of positive integers, `ones` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `sum` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases with reduced input.**
