Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description. 

The program first calculates the prefix sum of the array and the prefix count of ones in the array. Then, for each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray and the count of ones in the subarray. 

The condition to check if a subarray is good is that the sum of the subarray minus the count of ones in the subarray should be greater than or equal to the length of the subarray minus the count of ones in the subarray. This is because each element in the subarray should be greater than 1 and the sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of the elements in the subarray minus the count of ones in the subarray. 

The program correctly implements this logic and prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
