Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good or not. It uses two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray, respectively. The program then checks if the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the number of ones plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element, in which case it prints 'NO'. It also correctly handles the case where the subarray has more than one element and the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to the number of ones plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
