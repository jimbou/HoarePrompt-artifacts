Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] minus ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] minus sum[l - 1], l is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop head and body do not affect the state of the variables n, i, nums, ones, and sum, so their state remains unchanged. The loop head and body only affect the state of the variables onesInRange, sumInRange, l, and r, which are updated in each iteration. After the loop finishes executing, the values of these variables are the same as they were after the third iteration.
