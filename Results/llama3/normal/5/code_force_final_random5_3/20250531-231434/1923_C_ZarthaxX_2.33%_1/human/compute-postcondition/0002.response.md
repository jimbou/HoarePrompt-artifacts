Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, q is an integer, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with reduced input.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `q` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `nums` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ones` is modified by the code, where `ones[i]` is equal to `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise `ones[i]` is equal to `ones[i - 1]`. The value of `sum` is modified by the code, where `sum[i]` is equal to `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]` minus 1. The value of stdin remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
