You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines of two space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the list of integers. The second integer of the second line of each test case is the number of queries. The list of integers contains positive integers. The first integer of each query is the start index of the subarray (1-indexed). The second integer of each query is the end index of the subarray (1-indexed). The number of queries does not exceed the length of the list of integers.
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with reduced input.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] minus ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] minus sum[l - 1], l is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer greater than or equal to 0, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] minus ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] minus sum[l - 1], l is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
