Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with reduced input.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the number of iterations the loop was supposed to execute. The lists `ones` and `sum` will have been updated according to the loop's body, where `ones[i]` will be the cumulative count of 1's in the `nums` list up to index `i-1`, and `sum[i]` will be the cumulative sum of the `nums` list up to index `i-1` minus `i`. The other variables `n`, `q`, `nums`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
