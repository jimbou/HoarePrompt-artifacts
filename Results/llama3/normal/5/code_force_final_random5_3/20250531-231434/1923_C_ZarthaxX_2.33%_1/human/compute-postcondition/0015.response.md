Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, q is an integer greater than 0, nums is a list of positive integers, ones is a list of integers where ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is equal to ones[i - 1], sum is a list of integers where sum[i] is equal to sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1] minus 1, onesInRange is an integer equal to ones[r] minus ones[l - 1], sumInRange is an integer equal to sum[r] minus sum[l - 1].**

The code calculates the difference in the number of ones and the sum of numbers between the indices l and r in the lists ones and sum, respectively. The variables onesInRange and sumInRange are assigned these differences. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
