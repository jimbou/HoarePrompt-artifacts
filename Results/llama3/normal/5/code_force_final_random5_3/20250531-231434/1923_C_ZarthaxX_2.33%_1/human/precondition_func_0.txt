stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines of two space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the list of integers. The second integer of the second line of each test case is the number of queries. The list of integers contains positive integers. The first integer of each query is the start index of the subarray (1-indexed). The second integer of each query is the end index of the subarray (1-indexed). The number of queries does not exceed the length of the list of integers.
