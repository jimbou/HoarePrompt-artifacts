Output State: **`num` is an integer equal to its original value, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `list1` is a sorted list of strings, `list2` contains the integer value of the string at index 0 of `list1` and the integer value of the string at index 2*i of `list1`, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `a` is a string that must be a non-empty string that can be converted to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `list2` has been updated to include the integer value of the string at index 2*i of `list1`, in addition to the integer value of the string at index 0 of `list1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
