Output State: **`num` is an integer equal to its original value, `out` is a list containing the sum of the integer values of the strings at even indices of `list1`, `numbers` is 0, `list1` is a sorted list of strings, `list2` contains the integer value of the string at index 0 of `list1`, the integer value of the string at index 2*i of `list1`, the integer value of the string at index 4 of `list1`, and so on, up to the integer value of the string at index 2*(a-1) of `list1`, `a` is a string that must be a non-empty string that can be converted to an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is a-1, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `out` has been updated to include the sum of the integer values of the strings at even indices of `list1`, which is stored in `list2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The sum of the integer values of the strings at even indices of `list1` is appended to the `out` list.
