Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), num is a string containing the first integer t, out is an empty list.**

The first line reads the first integer t from stdin and assigns it to the variable num as a string. This means that stdin now contains t-1 test cases. The second line initializes an empty list out. No other variables are affected.
