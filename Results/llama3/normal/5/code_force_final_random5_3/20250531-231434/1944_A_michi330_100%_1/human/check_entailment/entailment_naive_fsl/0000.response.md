Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. Then, for each test case, it reads the number of islands `n` and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed `k`.

If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, making it impossible for Everule to visit any other island. In this case, the program correctly prints 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

If `k` is less than `n-1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1, and Everule can visit all islands. In this case, the program correctly prints `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all islands.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
