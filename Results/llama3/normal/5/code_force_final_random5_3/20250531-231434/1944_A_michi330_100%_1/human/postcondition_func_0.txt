This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers: the number of nodes (n) and the number of edges (k) in a graph. It then prints the minimum number of nodes that need to be removed to make the graph a tree, which is 1 if the number of edges is greater than or equal to the number of nodes minus 1, and the number of nodes otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.
