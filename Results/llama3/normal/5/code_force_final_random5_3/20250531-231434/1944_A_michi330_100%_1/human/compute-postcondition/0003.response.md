Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2), `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2). The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.**
