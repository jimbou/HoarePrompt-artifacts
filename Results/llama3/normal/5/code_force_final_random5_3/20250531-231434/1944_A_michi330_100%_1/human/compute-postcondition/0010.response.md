To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, t, 1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = t-1` with a step of 1.

The current state is:

* `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3)
* `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100)
* `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2)
* `i` is 0
* stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2)

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
* The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.
* The values of `n` and `k` are not relevant to the loop head, as they are not used in the loop condition.
* The state of stdin is not relevant to the loop head, as it is not used in the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2), `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2)**
