Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2), `i` is `t-1`, stdin is empty. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all `t` iterations. The variable `i` has reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The input buffer (stdin) is now empty, as all input lines have been processed. The values of `n` and `k` are still within their respective ranges, and the output is determined by the condition `k >= n - 1`, printing either 1 or the value of `n`.
