Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2), `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2)**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the new values read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, because one line has been read and processed.
