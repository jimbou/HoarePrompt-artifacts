The code prints the value of `n`, which is an integer (1 <= n <= 100) read from the standard input `stdin`. Since there are `t-3` lines in `stdin`, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, the value of `n` printed will be the first integer in the first line of `stdin`.

Output: **the first integer in the first line of stdin (which is n)**
