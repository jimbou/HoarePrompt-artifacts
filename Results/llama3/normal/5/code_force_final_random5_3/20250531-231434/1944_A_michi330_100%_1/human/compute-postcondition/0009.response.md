Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2), `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` is printed.***
