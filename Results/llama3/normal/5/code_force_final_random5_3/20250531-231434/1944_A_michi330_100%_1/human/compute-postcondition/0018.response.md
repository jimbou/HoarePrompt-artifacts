Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2), `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the first line of the input. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, because one line has been read and processed.
