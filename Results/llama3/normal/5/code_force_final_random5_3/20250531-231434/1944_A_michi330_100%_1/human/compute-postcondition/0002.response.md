Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 100), `k` is an integer (0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2), `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2)**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the first line of input from stdin, and the remaining `t-1` lines are still in stdin. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the range of `t` is still valid.
