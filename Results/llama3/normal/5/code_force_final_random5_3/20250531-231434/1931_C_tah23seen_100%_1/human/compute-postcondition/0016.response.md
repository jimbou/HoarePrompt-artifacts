Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the index of the first element from the end that is not equal to the next element and the index of the first element that is not equal to the next element minus 1, and 0.**

In this case, since `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, and `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` from the end that is not equal to the next element, the expression `j - i - 1` calculates the number of elements between these two indices (exclusive). The `max` function then returns the maximum value between this calculated value and 0.

Note that since `arr` has at least two elements and the first element is equal to the last element, `i` and `j` are guaranteed to exist.
