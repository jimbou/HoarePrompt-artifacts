    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the last index of `arr`.

    #State: *`arr` has at least two elements, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` from the end that is not equal to the next element. The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`

    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of the difference between the length of `arr` and the index `i` minus 1, and the index `j`, and 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum length of a subarray in the input list `arr` that does not contain the first or last element of `arr`, or returns 0 if no such subarray exists. It takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer value.
