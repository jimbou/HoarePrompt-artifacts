Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of the difference between the length of `arr` and the index `i` minus 1, and the index `j`, and 0.**

In this output state, `n` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, and `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` from the end that is not equal to the next element. The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.
