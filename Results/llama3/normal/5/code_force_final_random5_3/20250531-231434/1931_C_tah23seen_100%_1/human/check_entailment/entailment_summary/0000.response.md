Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of burles (or operations) required to make all elements of the array equal. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function `func_1` works by first finding the longest prefix and suffix of the array that contain the same element. It then checks if the first and last elements of the array are the same. If they are, it returns the maximum length of the subarray that does not contain the first or last element. If they are not, it returns the minimum length of the subarray that contains the first or last element.

However, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal, which involves finding the minimum number of operations required to replace all elements with a single value. The program's approach of finding the longest prefix and suffix and checking if the first and last elements are the same does not correctly solve this problem.

For example, consider the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The program would return `4`, which is incorrect because the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal is actually `5` (by replacing all elements with the value `1`).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
