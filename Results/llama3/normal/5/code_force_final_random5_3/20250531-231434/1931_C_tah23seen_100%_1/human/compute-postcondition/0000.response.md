Output State: **arr is a list of integers, i is 0, n is the length of arr, j is the last index of arr.**

In this output state, the initial state of `arr` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The code introduces three new variables: `i`, `n`, and `j`. The variable `i` is assigned the value 0. The variable `n` is assigned the length of the list `arr`. The variable `j` is assigned the last index of the list `arr`, which is one less than the length of `arr` (since indexing starts at 0).
