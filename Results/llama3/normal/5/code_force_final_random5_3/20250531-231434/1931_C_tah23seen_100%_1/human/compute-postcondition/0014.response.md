Output State: **`arr` has at least two elements, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` from the end that is not equal to the next element.**

The loop will continue to execute until it finds the first element from the end that is not equal to the next element. At this point, `j` will be the index of this element, and the loop will terminate. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `n` will remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
