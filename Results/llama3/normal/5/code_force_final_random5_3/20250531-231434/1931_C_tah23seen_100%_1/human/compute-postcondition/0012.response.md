According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr`. If `j` is greater than 0 and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the third last index of `arr`, `arr` has at least three elements, the last three elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is greater than 2. `j` being the third last index of `arr` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is greater than 0. `arr[j]` being equal to `arr[j - 1]` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]` and `j` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` has at least three elements, the last three elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is greater than 0 and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`**
