The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, the first two elements are equal, and the second and third elements are equal, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is the last index of `arr`.**
