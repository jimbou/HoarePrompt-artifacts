Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers, i is 0, n is the length of arr, j is the last index of arr.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first two elements are equal, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the last index of `arr`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, the first two elements are equal, and the second and third elements are equal, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is the last index of `arr`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, the first two elements are equal, the second and third elements are equal, and the third and fourth elements are equal, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is the last index of `arr`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
