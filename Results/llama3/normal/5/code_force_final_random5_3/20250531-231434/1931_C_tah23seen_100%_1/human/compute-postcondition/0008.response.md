To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved accordingly. The loop head is `while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:`.

1. **Condition `j > 0`**: For this condition to be true, `j` must be greater than 0. Since `j` is the last index of `arr`, this means `arr` must have at least one element for `j` to be greater than 0.

2. **Condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**: For this condition to be true, the last element of `arr` (at index `j`) must be equal to the second last element (at index `j - 1`). This implies that `arr` must have at least two elements for this comparison to be valid and true.

Given these conditions, we can conclude that for the loop to execute the first time:

- `arr` must have at least two elements.
- The last two elements of `arr` must be equal.

The state of `i` (the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element) does not affect the execution of the loop's first iteration, as it is not part of the loop's condition. Similarly, the exact value of `n` (the length of `arr`) is not critical as long as `arr` has at least two elements, which is implied by the condition that `j > 0` and the requirement for `arr[j]` and `arr[j - 1]` to exist.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed is:

State: **`arr` has at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the last index of `arr`**
