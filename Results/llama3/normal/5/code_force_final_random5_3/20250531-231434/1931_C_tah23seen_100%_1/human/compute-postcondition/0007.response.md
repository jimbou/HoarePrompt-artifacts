Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the last index of `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `i` will be the index of the first element in the list `arr` that is not equal to the next element. The list `arr` itself, its length `n`, and the last index `j` remain unchanged.
