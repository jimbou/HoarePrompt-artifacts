Output State: **`arr` has at least three elements, the last three elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is the third last index of `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been updated to be the third last index of `arr`, which is one less than its previous value as the second last index. The other variables remain unchanged, with `arr` still having at least three elements and the last three elements being equal, `i` still being the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, and `n` still being greater than 2.
