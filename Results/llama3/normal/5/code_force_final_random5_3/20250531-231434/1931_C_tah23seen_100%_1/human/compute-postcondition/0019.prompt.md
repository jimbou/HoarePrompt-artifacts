You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the last index of `arr`.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: `arr` has at least two elements, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` from the end that is not equal to the next element.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the index of the first element from the end that is not equal to the next element and the index of the first element that is not equal to the next element minus 1, and 0.
    #State: *`arr` has at least two elements, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` from the end that is not equal to the next element. The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of the difference between the length of `arr` and the index `i` minus 1, and the index `j`, and 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the index of the first element from the end that is not equal to the next element and the index of the first element that is not equal to the next element minus 1, and 0.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of the difference between the length of `arr` and the index `i` minus 1, and the index `j`, and 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
