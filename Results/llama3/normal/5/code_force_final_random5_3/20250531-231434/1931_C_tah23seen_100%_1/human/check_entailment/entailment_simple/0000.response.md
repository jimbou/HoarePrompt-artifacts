Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" required to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function first finds the index `i` of the first element in the array that is not equal to the next element, and the index `j` of the first element from the end that is not equal to the next element. If the first element of the array is equal to the last element, the function returns the maximum value between the difference of `j` and `i` minus 1, and 0. Otherwise, the function returns the maximum value between the minimum of the difference between the length of the array and `i` minus 1, and `j`, and 0.

The program then reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements. It then calls the function `func_1` with the array as input and prints the returned value.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
