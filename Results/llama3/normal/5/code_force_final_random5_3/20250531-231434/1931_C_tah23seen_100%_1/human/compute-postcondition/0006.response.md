Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, the first two elements are equal, the second and third elements are equal, and the third and fourth elements are equal, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is the last index of `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still has at least 4 elements, and the first two elements are still equal, the second and third elements are still equal, and the third and fourth elements are still equal. The value of `n` is still greater than 2, and `j` is still the last index of `arr`.
