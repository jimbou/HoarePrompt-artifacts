The code `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` is greater than 0, the new value of `j` is still greater than -1 but less than the original value of `j`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`arr` has at least three elements, the last three elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is greater than -1 but less than the original value of `j` and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`**
