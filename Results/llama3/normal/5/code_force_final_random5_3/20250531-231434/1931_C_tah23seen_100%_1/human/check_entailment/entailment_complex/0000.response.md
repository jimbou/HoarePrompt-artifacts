Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" required to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate this minimum number.

The function `func_1` works by first finding the indices `i` and `j` of the first and last elements in the array that are not equal to their adjacent elements. If the first and last elements of the array are equal, the function returns the maximum value between the difference of `j` and `i` minus 1, and 0. This is because in this case, the minimum number of burles required is the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (inclusive).

If the first and last elements of the array are not equal, the function returns the maximum value between the minimum of the difference between the length of the array and `i` minus 1, and `j`, and 0. This is because in this case, the minimum number of burles required is the length of the subarray between the end of the array and `j` (inclusive), or the length of the subarray between `i` and the start of the array (inclusive), whichever is smaller.

The program then calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

However, there is a logical error in the function. The function is supposed to return the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal, but it actually returns the maximum length of a subarray that does not contain the first or last element of the array. This is not the correct solution to the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
