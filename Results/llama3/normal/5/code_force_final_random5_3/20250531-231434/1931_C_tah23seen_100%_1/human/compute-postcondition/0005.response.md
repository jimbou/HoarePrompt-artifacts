According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`. If `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is the last index of `arr`, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, the first two elements are equal, and the second and third elements are equal. `i` being 2 and `n` being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` needs to be adjusted to `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, the first two elements are equal, the second and third elements are equal, and the third and fourth elements are equal, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is the last index of `arr`**
