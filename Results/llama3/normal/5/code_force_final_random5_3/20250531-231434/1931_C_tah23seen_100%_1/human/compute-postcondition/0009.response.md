The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The value of `j` was the last index of `arr`, so now `j` is the second last index of `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` has at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the second last index of `arr`**
