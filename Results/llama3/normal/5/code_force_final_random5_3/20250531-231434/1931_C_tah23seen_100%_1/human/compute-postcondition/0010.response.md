To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `j` and `arr` (specifically, the elements at indices `j` and `j-1`).

According to the loop condition, `j` must be greater than 0, and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j-1]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second last index of `arr`, which means `j` is equal to `n-2`. To ensure `j` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2.

Additionally, since `arr` has at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, we can conclude that `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`. However, to ensure this condition holds for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `arr` such that the elements at indices `j-1` and `j-2` are also equal.

State: **`arr` has at least three elements, the last three elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the next element, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is the second last index of `arr`**
