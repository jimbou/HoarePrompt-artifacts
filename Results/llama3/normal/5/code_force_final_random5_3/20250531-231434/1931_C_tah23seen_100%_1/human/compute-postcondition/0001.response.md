To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the involved variables accordingly.

The loop head is: `while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:`

1. `i < len(arr) - 1`: This condition requires that `i` is less than the second last index of `arr`. Since `i` is 0, this condition is already satisfied if `arr` has at least 2 elements.

2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`: This condition requires that the first element of `arr` is equal to the second element of `arr`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `arr` is a list of integers
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the length of `arr`
- `j` is the last index of `arr`

To ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to adjust the state of `arr` so that it has at least 2 elements and the first two elements are equal.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first two elements are equal, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the last index of `arr`**
