Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, then `match_c` is False if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_c` remains unchanged.**
