To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must also be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `template`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2**
