Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `match_a_b` is True, `stdin` is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). Additionally, if `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). Additionally, if `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is False. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
