Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`. If the lowercase of the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` is equal to the lowercase of the character at index `i` in `template`, then `match_a_b` is `False`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
