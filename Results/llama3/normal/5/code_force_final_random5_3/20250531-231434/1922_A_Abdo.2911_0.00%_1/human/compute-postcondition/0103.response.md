To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`. If the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, then `match_a_b` is False if the current value of `a[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If the current value of `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, then `match_a_b` is False if the current value of `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). Otherwise, no changes are made.**
