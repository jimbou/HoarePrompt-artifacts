Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, `match_a_b` is `False` if any of the conditions in the loop body are met, otherwise it remains `True`, and `match_c` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`. If the character at index `i` in string `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template` (case sensitive), then `match_c` is `False`. If the character at index `i` in `c` (case insensitive) is equal to the character at index `i` in `template` (case insensitive), then `match_c` is `False`. Otherwise, `match_c` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`. If the character at index `i` in string `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template` (case sensitive), then `match_c` is `False`. If the character at index `i` in string `c` (case insensitive) is equal to the character at index `i` in `template` (case insensitive) and the character at index `i` in `template` is uppercase, then `match_c` is `False`. Otherwise, `match_c` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`. If the character at index `i` in string `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template` (case sensitive), then `match_c` is `False`. If the character at index `i` in string `c` (case insensitive) is equal to the character at index `i` in `template` (case insensitive) and the character at index `i` in `template` is uppercase, then `match_c` is `False`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase, then `match_c` remains `True` if the character at index `i` in string `c` is equal to the character at index `i` in `template` (case sensitive). Otherwise, `match_c` remains `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
