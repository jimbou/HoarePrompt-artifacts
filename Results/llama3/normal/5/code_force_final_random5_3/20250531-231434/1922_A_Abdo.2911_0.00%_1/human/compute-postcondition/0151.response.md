To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. 

Since `i` is already equal to `n`, we only need to adjust `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed**
