State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`. If the character at index `i` in string `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template` (case sensitive), then `match_c` is `False`. If the character at index `i` in string `c` (case insensitive) is equal to the character at index `i` in `template` (case insensitive) and the character at index `i` in `template` is uppercase, then `match_c` is `False`. Otherwise, `match_c` remains `True`.**
