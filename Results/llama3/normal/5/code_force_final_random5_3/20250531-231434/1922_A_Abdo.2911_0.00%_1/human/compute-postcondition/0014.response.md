The code appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. Since `i` is 2, the character at index 2 of string `a` is appended to `template`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the character at index 2 of string `a`.**
