Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `stdin` is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the `template` list will contain the characters from string `a` at indices 0 through `n-1`, either in their original case if they match the characters at the same indices in string `b`, or in uppercase if they do not match. The other variables remain unchanged.
