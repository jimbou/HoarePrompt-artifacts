Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 1, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty. If template[i] is lowercase, then if c[i] is not equal to template[i], match_c is False. If template[i] is not lowercase, then if the character at index i in string c (case-insensitive) matches the character at index i in the template, match_c is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
