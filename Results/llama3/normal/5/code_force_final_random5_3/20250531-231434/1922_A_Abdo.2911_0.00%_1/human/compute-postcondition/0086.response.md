Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index 0 of string `a` and the character at index `i` of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase character at index 0 of string `a` repeated twice.**
