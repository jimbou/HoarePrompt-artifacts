Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`. If `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
