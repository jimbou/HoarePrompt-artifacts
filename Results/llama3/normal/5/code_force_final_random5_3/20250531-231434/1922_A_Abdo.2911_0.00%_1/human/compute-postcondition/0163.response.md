Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `n+2`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n+2`, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` and either the character at index `i` of string `a` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase character at index `i` in string `a` if `a[i] != b[i]`, and the uppercase character at index `i` in string `a` has been appended to `template`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1. The value of `_` is still 2. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to `n+2`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still strings. The value of `i` is still `n+2`. The value of `template` has been updated to include the uppercase character at index `i` in string `a`. Either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed. The stdin is still empty.
