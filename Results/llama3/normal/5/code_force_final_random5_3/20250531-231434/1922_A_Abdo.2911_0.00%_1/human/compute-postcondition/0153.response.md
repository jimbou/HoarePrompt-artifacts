Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `template` has been updated to include the character at index `i` of string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still equal to `n`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed. The stdin is still empty.
