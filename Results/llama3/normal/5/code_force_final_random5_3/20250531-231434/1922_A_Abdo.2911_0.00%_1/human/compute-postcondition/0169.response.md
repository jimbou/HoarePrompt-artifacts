Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `match_a_b` is True, `stdin` is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal. The current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.***
