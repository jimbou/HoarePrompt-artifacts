Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is n, template is an empty list, match_a_b is False, and match_c is False, stdin is empty.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `a`. The third line assigns the string value of the input to `b`. The fourth line assigns the string value of the input to `c`. The fifth line initializes an empty list `template`. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` remain unchanged. Stdin is now empty since all inputs have been consumed.
