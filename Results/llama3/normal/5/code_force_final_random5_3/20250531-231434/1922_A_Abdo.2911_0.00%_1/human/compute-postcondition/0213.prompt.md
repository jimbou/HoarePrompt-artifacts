Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `match_a_b` is False if any of the following conditions are met: `template[i]` is lowercase and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case); `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`; `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged, `match_c` is True, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 0, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty. If template[i] is lowercase, then match_a_b and match_c remain unchanged if c[i] is equal to template[i], otherwise match_a_b is False and match_c is False. If template[i] is uppercase, then match_a_b is False if any of the following conditions are met: template[i] is lowercase and a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i]; template[i] is uppercase and a[i] is equal to template[i] (ignoring case) or b[i] is equal to template[i] (ignoring case); template[i] is uppercase and a[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower(); a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i]; a[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower(). Otherwise, match_a_b remains unchanged. match_c is False if c[i] is not equal to template[i] (ignoring case), otherwise match_c is True. template is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through n-1 of string a if the characters at those indices in a and b are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string a if the characters at those indices in a and b are not equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 1, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty. If template[i] is lowercase, then if c[i] is not equal to template[i], match_c is False. If template[i] is not lowercase, then if the character at index i in string c (case-insensitive) matches the character at index i in the template, match_c is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 2, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty. If template[i] is lowercase and c[i] is not equal to template[i], or if template[i] is not lowercase and the character at index i in string c (case-insensitive) matches the character at index i in the template, then match_c is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
