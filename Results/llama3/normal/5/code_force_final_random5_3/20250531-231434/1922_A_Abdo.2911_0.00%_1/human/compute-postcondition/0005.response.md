Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` (which is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`), `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The value of `_` remains 0. The value of `n` remains an integer and greater than 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain strings. The `template` list now contains the character at index `i` (which is 0) of string `a`, which is equal to the character at index `i` (which is 0) of string `b`. The `stdin` remains empty. The value of `i` remains 0.
