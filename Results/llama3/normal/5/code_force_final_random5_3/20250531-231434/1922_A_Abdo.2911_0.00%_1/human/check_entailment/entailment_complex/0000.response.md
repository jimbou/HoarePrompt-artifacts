Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The program first creates a template by comparing characters in strings a and b. If the characters at a particular index are the same, it adds the lowercase character to the template. If the characters are different, it adds the uppercase character to the template.

Then, it checks if the template matches strings a, b, and c. If the template matches a and b but not c, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the conditions for matching the template, including the case where the template character is uppercase and the string character is the same when ignoring case.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
