Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing the uppercase character at index 0 of string `a`, `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `stdin` is empty. The character at index `i` of string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0. The value of `_` remains 1. The value of `n` remains an integer and is greater than 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain strings. The value of `i` remains 0. The `template` list now contains the uppercase character at index 0 of string `a`. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain False. The stdin remains empty. The character at index `i` of string `a` is still not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`.
