Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `match_a_b` is False if any of the following conditions are met: `template[i]` is lowercase and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case); `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`; `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged, `match_c` is True, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their original values and properties, except for `match_c`, which is now set to True. The conditions for `match_a_b` remain unchanged, and the `template` list still contains the characters from string `a` based on the comparison with string `b`. The input/output state also remains the same, with either 'YES' or 'NO' having been printed and the stdin being empty.
