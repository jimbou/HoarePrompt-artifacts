Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the length of the strings, and the strings themselves.

2. It creates a template by comparing characters in strings a and b. If the characters at a given position are the same, it adds the character to the template in lowercase. If the characters are different, it adds the character from string a in uppercase to the template.

3. It checks if the template matches strings a and b. If the template character is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are the same as the template character. If the template character is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

4. It checks if the template does not match string c. If the template character is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is different from the template character. If the template character is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

5. If the template matches a and b but not c, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
