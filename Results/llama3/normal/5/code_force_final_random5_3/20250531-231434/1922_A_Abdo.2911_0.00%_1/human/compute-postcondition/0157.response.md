The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n+1` or `n` must be greater than or equal to `n+2` or `n` must be greater than or equal to `n+1+1` or `n` must be greater than or equal to `n+(1+1)` or `n` must be greater than or equal to `n+2`. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `n+2`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n+1`, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase character at index `n` in string `a`, and the character at index `n` in string `a` is not equal to the character at index `n` in string `b`.**
