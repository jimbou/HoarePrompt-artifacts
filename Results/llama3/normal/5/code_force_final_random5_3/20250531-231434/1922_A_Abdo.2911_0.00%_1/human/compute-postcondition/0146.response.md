Based on the given precondition, the code will print the string 'NO'. This is because the print statement is unconditional, meaning it will always print 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables `match_a_b` and `match_c`.

The precondition states that either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, but this information is not relevant to the print statement, as it does not depend on the values of these variables.

Therefore, the output will always be the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
