Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`. If the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, then `match_a_b` is False if the current value of `a[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If the current value of `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, then `match_a_b` is False if the current value of `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). If `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
