Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`. The character at index `i` of `template` is not lowercase. If the current value of `a[i]` is either equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case) or the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` (ignoring case), then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
