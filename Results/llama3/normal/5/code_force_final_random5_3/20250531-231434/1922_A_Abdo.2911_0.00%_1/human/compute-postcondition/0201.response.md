The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 1, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty.**
