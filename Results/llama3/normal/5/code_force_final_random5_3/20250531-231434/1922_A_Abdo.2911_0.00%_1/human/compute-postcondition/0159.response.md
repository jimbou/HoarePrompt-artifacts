Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `n+2`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n+1`, `stdin` is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` and the uppercase character at index `i` in string `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1. The value of `_` is still 2. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to `n+2`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still strings. The value of `i` is still `n+1`. The `stdin` is still empty. Either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed. The `template` list now contains two characters: the character at index `i` of string `a` and the uppercase character at index `i` in string `a`.
