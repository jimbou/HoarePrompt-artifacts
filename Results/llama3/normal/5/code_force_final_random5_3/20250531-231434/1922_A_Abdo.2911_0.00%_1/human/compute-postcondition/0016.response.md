Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If the character at index 2 of string `a` is equal to the character at index 2 of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index 2 of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list that contains the uppercase of the character at index 2 of string `a`.***
