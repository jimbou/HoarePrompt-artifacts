Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, `match_a_b` is `True` if none of the conditions in the loop body are met, otherwise it remains `False`, and `match_c` is `True` if none of the conditions in the loop body are met, otherwise it remains `False`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then 'YES' is printed and `match_c` is set to `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True`, and 'NO' is printed.***
