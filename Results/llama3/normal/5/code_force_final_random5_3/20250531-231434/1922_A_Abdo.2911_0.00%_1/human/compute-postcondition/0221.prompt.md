Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    match_a_b = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                match_a_b = False
                break
        elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
            ].lower():
            match_a_b = False
            break
    match_c = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if c[i] != template[i]:
                match_c = False
                break
        elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_c = False
            break
    if match_a_b and not match_c:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, `match_a_b` is `True` if none of the conditions in the loop body are met, otherwise it remains `False`, and `match_c` is `True` if none of the conditions in the loop body are met, otherwise it remains `False`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then 'YES' is printed and `match_c` is set to `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True`, and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is n, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty. If match_a_b is True and match_c is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either match_a_b is False or match_c is True, and 'NO' is printed. In both cases, if template[i] is lowercase, then match_a_b and match_c remain unchanged if c[i] is equal to template[i], otherwise match_a_b is False and match_c is False. If template[i] is uppercase, then match_a_b is False if any of the following conditions are met: template[i] is lowercase and a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i]; template[i] is uppercase and a[i] is equal to template[i] (ignoring case) or b[i] is equal to template[i] (ignoring case); template[i] is uppercase and a[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower(); a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i]; a[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower(). Otherwise, match_a_b remains unchanged. match_c is False if c[i] is not equal to template[i] (ignoring case), otherwise match_c is True. template is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through n-1 of string a if the characters at those indices in a and b are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string a if the characters at those indices in a and b are not equal.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
