Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is n, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty. If match_a_b is True and match_c is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either match_a_b is False or match_c is True, and 'NO' is printed. In both cases, if template[i] is lowercase, then match_a_b and match_c remain unchanged if c[i] is equal to template[i], otherwise match_a_b is False and match_c is False. If template[i] is uppercase, then match_a_b is False if any of the following conditions are met: template[i] is lowercase and a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i]; template[i] is uppercase and a[i] is equal to template[i] (ignoring case) or b[i] is equal to template[i] (ignoring case); template[i] is uppercase and a[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower(); a[i] is not equal to template[i] or b[i] is not equal to template[i]; a[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() is equal to template[i].lower(). Otherwise, match_a_b remains unchanged. match_c is False if c[i] is not equal to template[i] (ignoring case), otherwise match_c is True. template is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through n-1 of string a if the characters at those indices in a and b are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string a if the characters at those indices in a and b are not equal.**
