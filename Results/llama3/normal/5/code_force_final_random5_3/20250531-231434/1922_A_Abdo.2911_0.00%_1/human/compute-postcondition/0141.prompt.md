Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, `match_c` is True, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, `match_c` is False if `c[i]` does not match `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, then `match_c` is False if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, then `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, then `match_c` is False if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_c` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
