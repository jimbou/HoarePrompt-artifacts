Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin is empty, i is n-1. template is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string a if it is equal to the character at the same index in string b, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string a if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string b.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` remains 0, `n` remains an integer but can be 0 or more, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain strings, `stdin` remains empty, and `i` is now `n-1` because the loop iterates `n` times. The `template` list is populated with characters from string `a`, where each character is either the original character from `a` if it matches the character at the same index in `b`, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match the character at the same index in `b`.
