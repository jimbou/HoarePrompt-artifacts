Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase character at index `n` in string `a`, and the character at index `n` in string `a` is not equal to the character at index `n` in string `b`.***
