Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed.***
