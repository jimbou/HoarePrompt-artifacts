Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`. If `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
