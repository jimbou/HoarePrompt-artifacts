To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, so we can only adjust the states of `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. Therefore, `_` becomes 2, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The states of other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `template`, `stdin`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c`) do not need to be adjusted, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed.**
