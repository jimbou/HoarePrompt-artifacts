The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the character at index 0 of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase character at index 0 of string `a`.**
