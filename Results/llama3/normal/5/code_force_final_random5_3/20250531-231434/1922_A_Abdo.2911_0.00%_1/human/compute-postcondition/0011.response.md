The code `template.append(a[i].upper())` appends the uppercase version of the character at index `i` in string `a` to the list `template`. Since `i` is 1, it will append the second character of string `a` to `template`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the second character of string `a`.**
