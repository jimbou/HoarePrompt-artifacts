To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2**
