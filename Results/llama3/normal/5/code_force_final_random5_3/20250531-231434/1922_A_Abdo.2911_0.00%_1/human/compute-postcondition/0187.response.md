Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case). Additionally, if `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
