Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, `match_a_b` is `False` if any of the conditions in the loop body are met, otherwise it remains `True`, and `match_c` is `True`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `match_c` which is set to `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
