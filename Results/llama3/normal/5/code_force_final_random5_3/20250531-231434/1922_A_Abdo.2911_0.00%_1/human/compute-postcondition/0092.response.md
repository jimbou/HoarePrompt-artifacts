Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `match_a_b` is True, `stdin` is empty. If the character at index `i` of string `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, then `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `match_a_b` which is set to True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `template` remains the same, depending on whether the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b` are equal or not.
