Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed `t` times, and stdin is empty. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed. In both cases, if `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is False and `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if any of the following conditions are met: `template[i]` is lowercase and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case); `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`; `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged. `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_c` is True. `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal.
