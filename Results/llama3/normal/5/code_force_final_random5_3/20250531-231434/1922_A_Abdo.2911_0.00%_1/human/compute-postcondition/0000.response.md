The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer accepted from the input. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. So, after accepting `t` from the input, stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
