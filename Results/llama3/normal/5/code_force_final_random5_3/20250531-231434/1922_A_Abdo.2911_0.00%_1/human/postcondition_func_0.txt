This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. The function creates a template by comparing characters in strings a and b, and then checks if the template matches strings a, b, and c. If the template matches a and b but not c, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process t times and then exits, leaving stdin empty.
