Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 0, stdin is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and template is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through n-1 of string a if the characters at those indices in a and b are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string a if the characters at those indices in a and b are not equal. The character at index i in template is uppercase. If the current value of a[i] is either equal to template[i] (ignoring case) or b[i] is equal to template[i] (ignoring case), then match_a_b is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
