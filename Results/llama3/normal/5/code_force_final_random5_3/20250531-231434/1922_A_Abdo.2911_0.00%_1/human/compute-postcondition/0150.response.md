Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is n, template is an empty list, stdin is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `template` have been updated based on the provided code snippet. The value of `n` is now an integer greater than or equal to 0, which was read from the input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now strings, which were also read from the input. The value of `i` is equal to `n`. The `template` list is now empty. The `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been consumed. Additionally, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed to the output, depending on the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`.
