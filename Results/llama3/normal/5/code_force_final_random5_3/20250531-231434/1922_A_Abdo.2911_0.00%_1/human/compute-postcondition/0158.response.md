Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `n+2`, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n+1`, `stdin` is empty, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and `template` is a list containing the character at index `i` of string `a` and either the character at index `i` of string `a` or the uppercase character at index `n` in string `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values, and the `template` list has been updated to include the character at index `i` of string `a`. The `template` list now contains two elements: the character at index `i` of string `a` and either the character at index `i` of string `a` (if it's equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`) or the uppercase character at index `n` in string `a` (if it's not equal to the character at index `n` in string `b`).
