Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, i is 0, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed, and stdin is empty. If c[i] is not equal to template[i], then match_a_b is False and match_c is False. Otherwise, the values of match_a_b and match_c remain unchanged.***
