The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, `match_c` is False if `c[i]` does not match `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty.**
