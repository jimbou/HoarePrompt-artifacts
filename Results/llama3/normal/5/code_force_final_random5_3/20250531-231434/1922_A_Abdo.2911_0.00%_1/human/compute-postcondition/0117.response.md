Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, `match_c` is True, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `match_c` has been updated to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `match_a_b` are still dependent on the values of `template`, `a`, and `b`, and the other variables retain their initial values.
