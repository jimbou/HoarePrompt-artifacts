Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list containing the uppercase character at index `n` in string `a`, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed. Additionally, the character at index `n` in string `a` is not equal to the character at index `n` in string `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains unchanged, `_` is still 2, `n` is still an integer greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are still strings, `i` is still equal to `n`, `stdin` is still empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed. The only change is that the `template` list now contains the uppercase character at index `n` in string `a`. The condition that the character at index `n` in string `a` is not equal to the character at index `n` in string `b` still holds.
