To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 0, `match_a_b` is True, `stdin` is empty, `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a`**
