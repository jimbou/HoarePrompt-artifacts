Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first constructs a template based on the strings a and b. If a character at a particular position is the same in both a and b, it is added to the template as a lowercase letter. If the characters are different, the character from a is added to the template as an uppercase letter.

2. The program then checks if the strings a and b match the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

3. The program then checks if the string c does not match the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is different from the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

4. If the strings a and b match the template and the string c does not match the template, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, including when the strings a and b are the same, when the strings a and b are different, and when the string c is the same as or different from the strings a and b. Therefore, the program is correct.
