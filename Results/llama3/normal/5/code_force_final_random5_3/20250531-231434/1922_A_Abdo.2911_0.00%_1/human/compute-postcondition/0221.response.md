Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 1000 (inclusive), `_` is `t`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is `n`, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed `t` times, and stdin is empty. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True, and 'NO' is printed. In both cases, if `template[i]` is lowercase, then `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` is False and `match_c` is False. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then `match_a_b` is False if any of the following conditions are met: `template[i]` is lowercase and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case) or `b[i]` is equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case); `template[i]` is uppercase and `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`; `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged. `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` (ignoring case), otherwise `match_c` is True. `template` is a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `t` is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `_` is now equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are still the same as they were before the loop started executing. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `match_a_b` and `match_c` are still the same as they were before the loop started executing, but they may have been updated during the execution of the loop. The value of `template` is now a list containing the characters at indices 0 through `n-1` of string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are equal, or the uppercase characters at those indices in string `a` if the characters at those indices in `a` and `b` are not equal. The loop has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' `t` times, depending on the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`.
