The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `i` is 1, `template` is a list of characters where each character is either the character at the same index in string `a` if it is equal to the character at the same index in string `b`, or the uppercase of the character at the same index in string `a` if it is not equal to the character at the same index in string `b`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, then if the lowercase of the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the lowercase of the character at index `i` in `template`, or the lowercase of the character at index `i` in `b` is equal to the lowercase of the character at index `i` in `template`, then `match_a_b` is `False`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
