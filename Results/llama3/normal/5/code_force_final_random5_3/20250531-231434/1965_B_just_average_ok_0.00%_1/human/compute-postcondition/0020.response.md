To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. The variable `idx` is currently 2, so the condition is `k >= 1 << 2`, which simplifies to `k >= 4`.

Given that `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 4. No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `k` and `idx`, and `idx` is not being adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 2, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)**
