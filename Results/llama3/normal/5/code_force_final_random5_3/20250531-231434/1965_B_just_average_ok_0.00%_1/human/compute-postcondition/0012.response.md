Based on the initial state, the code `print(*nums)` will print the elements of the list `nums`. The list `nums` contains 25 integers, where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The value of `idx` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(k) - 1`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the 25 elements of the list `nums`, which include 22 powers of 2 and the three special integers `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Output: **[22 powers of 2, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1] (where k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, and nums is a list of 25 integers)**
