Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 4 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 3, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^6, 1 <= `k` <= `n`).**

The code increments the value of `idx` by 1, so its new value is 3. The values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The stdin still contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, as the code does not modify the input.
