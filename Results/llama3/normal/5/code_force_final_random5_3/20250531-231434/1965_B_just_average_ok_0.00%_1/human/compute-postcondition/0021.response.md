Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 3, stdin contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains t - 3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, with the same constraints as before.
