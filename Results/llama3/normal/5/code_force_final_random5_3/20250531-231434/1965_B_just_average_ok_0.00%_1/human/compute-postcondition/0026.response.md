The code prints the elements of the list `nums`. The list `nums` contains 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three new elements: `k - 2^(idx-1)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^(idx-1) + 1`. Here, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `idx` is the integer equal to `log2(k) + 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the three new elements in the list `nums`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the 24 elements of the list `nums`, which include the three new elements and the remaining 21 powers of 2.

Output: **[k - 2^(idx-1), k + 1, k + 2^(idx-1) + 1, and 21 powers of 2]**
