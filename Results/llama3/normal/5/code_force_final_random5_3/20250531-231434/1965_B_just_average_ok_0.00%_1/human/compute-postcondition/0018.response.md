To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. The loop will continue as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `2` raised to the power of `idx`.

Given that `idx` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `1 << idx` equals 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

However, since `k` is already an integer greater than or equal to 1, it inherently meets this condition. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `k` or `idx` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and the state of `stdin`) are not part of the loop condition, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 1, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)**
