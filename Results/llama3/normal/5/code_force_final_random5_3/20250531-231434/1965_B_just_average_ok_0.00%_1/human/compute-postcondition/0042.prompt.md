Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
    idx = 0
    while k >= 1 << idx:
        idx += 1
    idx -= 1
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1, idx is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(k) minus 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), the length of the list nums which is 25 is being printed, and the list nums which contains 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three new elements: k - 2^(idx-1), k + 1, and k + 2^(idx-1) + 1, idx is the integer equal to log2(k) + 1, stdin contains t - idx lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), and the list nums which contains 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three new elements: k - 2^(idx-1), k + 1, and k + 2^(idx-1) + 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[22], k + 1, and k + nums[22] + 1 respectively, idx is 23, stdin contains t - idx - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), and the length of the list nums which is 24 is being printed, and the list nums is being printed which contains 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[22], k + 1, and k + nums[22] + 1 respectively




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
