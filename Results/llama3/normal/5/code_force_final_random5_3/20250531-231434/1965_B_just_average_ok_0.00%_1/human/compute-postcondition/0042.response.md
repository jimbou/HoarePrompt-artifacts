Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[22], k + 1, and k + nums[22] + 1 respectively, idx is 23, stdin contains 0 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), and the length of the list nums which is 24 is being printed, and the list nums is being printed which contains 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[22], k + 1, and k + nums[22] + 1 respectively**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, because the loop will have finished executing and there will be no more input lines in stdin. The values of n, k, nums, and idx will remain the same as in the output state after the loop executes 3 times.
