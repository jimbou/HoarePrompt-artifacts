The variables in the loop head are k and idx, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and idx. If k is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by idx, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer between 2 and n inclusive, and idx is 2. For the loop to execute again, k must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 2, which is 4. Therefore, k must be greater than or equal to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 4 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 2, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^6, 1 <= `k` <= `n`).**
