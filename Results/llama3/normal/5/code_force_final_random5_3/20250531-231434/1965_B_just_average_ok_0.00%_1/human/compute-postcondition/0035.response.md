Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 8, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 3, `stdin` contains `t - idx - 2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^6, 1 <= `k` <= `n`).**

The code increments the value of `idx` by 1, so its new value is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - idx - 2` lines, each with two integers `n` and `k`, but the value of `idx` has been updated to 3.
