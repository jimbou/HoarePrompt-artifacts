The code prints the elements of the list `nums`. The list `nums` contains 24 integers, where the first 21 elements are powers of 2, and the last three elements are `k - nums[22]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[22] + 1` respectively.

Since the exact values of `k` and `nums[22]` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the last three elements. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the list of 24 integers.

Output: **[powers of 2 for the first 21 elements], k - nums[22], k + 1, k + nums[22] + 1 (where k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and nums[22] is the 23rd element of the list nums)**
