Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is 0, stdin contains t - idx - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)**

In this output state, the values of n and k have been updated to the new values read from stdin. The list nums has been initialized with 24 powers of 2, and idx has been set to 0. The stdin now contains t - idx - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k within the specified ranges.
