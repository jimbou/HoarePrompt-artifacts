Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 2, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^6, 1 <= `k` <= `n`).**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, because one line has been processed.
