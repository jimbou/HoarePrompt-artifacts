To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `k` and `idx`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `idx` is 2.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << (idx + 1)`, which is `1 << 3` or 8. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 8.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 8, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 2, `stdin` contains `t - idx - 2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^6, 1 <= `k` <= `n`)**
