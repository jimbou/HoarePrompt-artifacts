Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program generates a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 that meets the conditions specified in the problem. The sequence is constructed by first generating a list of 24 integers, where the first 22 elements are powers of 2, and the last three elements are k - 2^22, k + 1, and k + 2^22 + 1 respectively.

The program then prints the length of this list (which is always 24) and the list itself. This process is repeated for each test case in the input.

The correctness of the program can be verified by analyzing the construction of the sequence. The sequence is designed to ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, while also ensuring that for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

The use of powers of 2 in the sequence ensures that the sum of any subsequence can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2. By including k - 2^22, k + 1, and k + 2^22 + 1 in the sequence, the program ensures that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, while also ensuring that for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
