Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then generates a list of 24 integers, where the first 22 elements are powers of 2, and the last three elements are k - 2^22, k + 1, and k + 2^22 + 1 respectively. The function prints the length of this list (which is always 24) and the list itself. The function repeats this process for each test case in the input.**
