The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input has at least t lines, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains t-1 lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain t lines.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1, idx is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(k) minus 1, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), the length of the list nums which is 25 is being printed, and the list nums which contains 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1 is being printed**
