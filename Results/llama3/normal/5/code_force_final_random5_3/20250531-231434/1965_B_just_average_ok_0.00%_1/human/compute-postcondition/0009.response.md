Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three integers which are k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1, idx is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(k) minus 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive. The value of `k` also remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive. The list `nums` initially contained 24 integers, each a power of 2. After the code execution, `nums` now contains 25 integers. Three new integers have been added to the list: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. These three integers are not powers of 2. The rest of the integers in `nums` are still powers of 2. The value of `idx` has been decremented by 1, so it is now the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(k)` minus 1. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing `t-1` lines, each with two integers `n` and `k` within the specified ranges.
