Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is 24, stdin contains t - idx - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)**.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `idx` has reached its maximum value of 24, indicating that the loop has iterated 24 times. The variable `k` is still greater than or equal to 1, and the list `nums` remains unchanged, containing 24 integers that are powers of 2. The variable `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, and the `stdin` contains `t - idx - 2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` within the specified ranges.
