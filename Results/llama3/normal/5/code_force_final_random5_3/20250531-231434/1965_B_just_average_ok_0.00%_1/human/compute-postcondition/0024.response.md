The code prints the length of the list `nums`, which is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for three new elements: `k - 2^(idx-1)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^(idx-1) + 1`.

Since the length of the list `nums` is 24, the print statement will output the number 24.

Output: **24**
