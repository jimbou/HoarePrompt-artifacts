Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(k), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of idx. The value of idx is now the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(k), which means it is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to k. This is because the loop continues to increment idx as long as k is greater than or equal to 2 to the power of idx.
