Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)**

Explanation:

The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and k. This reduces the number of lines in stdin by 1. The second line creates a list of 24 integers, each being a power of 2, and assigns it to nums. The third line initializes idx to 0.

The initial state's conditions on n, k, and stdin are still valid after the code execution. The list nums is now a list of 24 powers of 2, and idx is 0. The length of nums and its contents are no longer being printed.
