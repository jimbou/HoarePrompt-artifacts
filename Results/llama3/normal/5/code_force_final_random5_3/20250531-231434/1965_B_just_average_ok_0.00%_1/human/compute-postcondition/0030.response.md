To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. This condition involves two variables: `k` and `idx`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2
- `idx` is 0
- `stdin` contains `t - idx - 2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^6, 1 <= `k` <= `n`)

The condition `k >= 1 << idx` simplifies to `k >= 1` when `idx` is 0 because `1 << 0` equals 1. Since `k` is already defined as an integer greater than or equal to 1, the condition is inherently satisfied by the initial state of `k`. There is no need to adjust the state of `k` or `idx` because `idx` is 0, and `k` being greater than or equal to 1 already meets the requirement for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute the first time, given the provided initial states.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - idx - 2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^6, 1 <= `k` <= `n`).**
