To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's execution) and the expression `int(input())`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), int(input()) must be greater than 0**
