Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first two inputs to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `n` and `k` are between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, and 1 and `n` inclusive respectively, `n` and `k` become integers within these ranges. The second line creates a list of 24 integers, each being a power of 2, and assigns it to `nums`. The third line assigns 0 to `idx`. The value of `t` is reduced by 1 as one line of input has been consumed. No other variables are affected.
