Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing two strings read from the input, first_row is a string containing the first character of the first string read from the input and the first character of the second string read from the input, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first string read from the input and the last character of the second string read from the input, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, _ is 0, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `m` also remains unchanged. The list `a` now contains two strings, the first one read from the input initially and the second one read from the input in the first line of the code. The string `first_row` now contains the first character of both strings read from the input, and the string `last_row` contains the last character of both strings read from the input. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1 due to the input operation in the first line of the code. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
