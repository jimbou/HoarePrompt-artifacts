Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It checks if the first and last rows or columns of the grid have the same character or more than one unique character. If either condition is met, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the cases where the first and last rows or columns have the same character, which means that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by selecting the first and last rows or columns and coloring all squares in between with the same color.

The program also correctly handles the cases where the first and last rows or columns have more than one unique character, which means that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in between with the same color.

Therefore, the program is correct and should print the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
