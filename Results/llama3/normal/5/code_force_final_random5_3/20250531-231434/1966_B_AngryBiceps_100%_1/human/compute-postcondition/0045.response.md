Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains t-n-1 test cases, _ is 1, i is n-1**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `_`, or `i`, as they are not assigned any new values. The variables `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reassigned to empty values, effectively resetting them. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as no input operations are performed. The conditions for printing 'NO' or 'YES' are not affected by this code snippet, as the necessary variables are not modified.
