Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 500) and a grid of n x m characters 'W' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing the first character of each string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of each string in a, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 0, i is n-1. If the first and last strings in a have all characters the same, but the first and last strings are not the same, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either the first and last strings in a do not have all the same characters, or the first and last strings in a are the same, or both the first and last strings in a have all the same characters, and either the first_row does not contain all the same characters, or the last_row does not contain all the same characters, or the first_row is equal to the last_row, and 'YES' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer read from the input, a is a list containing n strings read from the input, first_row is a string containing the first character of each string read from the input, last_row is a string containing the last character of each string read from the input, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 0, i is n-1. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character, the last string in the list a contains only one unique character, and the first string is not equal to the last string, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the length of the set of first_row is 1, the length of the set of last_row is 1, and first_row is not equal to last_row, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, m is an integer, a is a list containing n lines read from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of each line read from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of each line read from stdin, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 1. If the first and last lines of a both contain only one unique character and are not the same, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either the first row of a or the last row of a or both contain more than one unique character, or the first row of a is equal to the last row of a, or both the first row of a and the last row of a contain exactly one unique character, and 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
