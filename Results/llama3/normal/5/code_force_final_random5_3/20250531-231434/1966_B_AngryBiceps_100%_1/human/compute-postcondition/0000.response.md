According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains t test cases, `input()` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
