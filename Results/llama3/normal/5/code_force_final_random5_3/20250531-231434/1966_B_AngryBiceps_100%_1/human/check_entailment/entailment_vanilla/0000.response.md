Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first and last rows, and the first and last columns of the grid have the same color. If they do, and the colors are different, it prints "NO", indicating that it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, this approach is not correct. The problem statement allows for any number of operations, not just one. Therefore, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color even if the first and last rows, and the first and last columns do not have the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

WWWWWW
WBWBWB
WBWBWB
WBWBWB
WBWBWB
WWWWWW

The first and last rows have the same color (W), but the first and last columns do not (W and B respectively). However, it is still possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing two operations: first, select the top-left and bottom-right squares and color all squares in the subrectangle between them W; then, select the top-right and bottom-left squares and color all squares in the subrectangle between them W.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
