The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `m`, and initializes three variables: `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row`. The impact of the code on the program is as follows:

*   `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input.
*   `a` is initialized as an empty list.
*   `first_row` and `last_row` are initialized as empty strings.

After the code executes, the state of the variables is as follows:

*   `n` and `m` have integer values.
*   `a` is an empty list.
*   `first_row` and `last_row` are empty strings.
*   Stdin contains t-1 test cases.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0**
