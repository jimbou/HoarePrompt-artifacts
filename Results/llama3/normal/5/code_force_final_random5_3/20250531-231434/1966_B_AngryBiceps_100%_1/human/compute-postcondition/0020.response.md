Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing the first character of each string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of each string in a, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 0, i is n-1. If the first row and last row have the same length and all characters in the first row are the same, and all characters in the last row are the same, but the first row and last row are not the same, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either the first and last strings in a do not have all the same characters, or the first and last strings in a are the same, or both the first and last strings in a have all the same characters, and either the first_row does not contain all the same characters, or the last_row does not contain all the same characters, or the first_row is equal to the last_row, and 'YES' is being printed.***
