Output State: **n is an integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, m is an integer read from the input, a is a list containing one string read from the input, first_row is a string containing the first character of the string read from the input, last_row is a string containing the last character of the string read from the input, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 0, i is 0**

The code reads a string from the input and appends it to the list `a`. It then extracts the first and last characters of this string and appends them to the strings `first_row` and `last_row`, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1.
