Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, a is a list containing three lines read from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the first line read from stdin, the first character of the second line read from stdin, and the first character of the third line read from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first line read from stdin, the last character of the second line read from stdin, and the last character of the third line read from stdin, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, _ is 1**

The code appends a new line read from stdin to the list `a`, updates `first_row` by appending the first character of the newly read line, and updates `last_row` by appending the last character of the newly read line. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, and `_` remain unchanged.
