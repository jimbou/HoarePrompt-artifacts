The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases read from the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin contains t-n test cases. For the loop to execute again _ must be 1 and stdin contains t-n-1 test cases.
State: **n is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer read from the input, a is a list containing n strings read from the input, first_row is a string containing the first character of each string read from the input, last_row is a string containing the last character of each string read from the input, stdin contains t-n-1 test cases, _ is 1, i is n-1. If the first string in the list a contains only one unique character, the last string in the list a contains only one unique character, and the first string is not equal to the last string, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the length of the set of first_row is 1, the length of the set of last_row is 1, and first_row is not equal to last_row, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
