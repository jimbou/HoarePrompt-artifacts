Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether a given grid of characters 'W' and 'B' has a valid configuration, printing 'YES' if the first and last rows or columns have the same character or more than one unique character, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program works by reading the input grid and storing it in the list `a`. It also stores the first and last characters of each row in the strings `first_row` and `last_row`, respectively.

The program then checks if the first and last rows of the grid contain only one unique character and are not the same. If this is the case, it prints 'NO', because it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

If the first and last rows do not meet this condition, the program checks if the first and last columns of the grid contain only one unique character and are not the same. If this is the case, it prints 'NO', because it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

If neither of these conditions is met, the program prints 'YES', because it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
