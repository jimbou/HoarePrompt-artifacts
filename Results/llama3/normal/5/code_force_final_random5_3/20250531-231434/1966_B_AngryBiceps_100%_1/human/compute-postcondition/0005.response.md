Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing two strings, first_row is a string containing the first character of the first string in a and the first character of the second string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first string in a and the last character of the second string in a, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 0, i is 1**

Explanation: The code block reads a new string from stdin and appends it to the list `a`. The first character of this new string is added to `first_row`, and the last character of this new string is added to `last_row`. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
