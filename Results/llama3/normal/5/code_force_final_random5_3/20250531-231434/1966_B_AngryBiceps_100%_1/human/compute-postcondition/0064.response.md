Postcondition: **n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, m is an integer, a is a list containing n lines read from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of each line read from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of each line read from stdin, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 1. If the first and last lines of a both contain only one unique character and are not the same, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either the first row of a or the last row of a or both contain more than one unique character, or the first row of a is equal to the last row of a, or both the first row of a and the last row of a contain exactly one unique character, and 'YES' is printed.**
