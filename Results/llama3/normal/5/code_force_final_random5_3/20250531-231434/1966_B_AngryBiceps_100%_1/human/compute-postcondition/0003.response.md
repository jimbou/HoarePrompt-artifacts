Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing one string, first_row is a string containing the first character of the string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of the string in a, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 0, i is 0**

The code block executes as follows:

1. `a.append(input())`: This line reads a string from stdin and appends it to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially empty, it now contains one string. The string is read from stdin, which initially contained t-1 test cases. After reading one string, stdin now contains t-2 test cases.

2. `first_row += a[-1][0]`: This line adds the first character of the string in `a` to the string `first_row`. Since `a` now contains one string, `a[-1]` refers to that string. The first character of that string is added to `first_row`, which was initially an empty string.

3. `last_row += a[-1][-1]`: This line adds the last character of the string in `a` to the string `last_row`. Since `a` now contains one string, `a[-1]` refers to that string. The last character of that string is added to `last_row`, which was initially an empty string.

The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, and `i` are not modified by the code block, so they remain the same. The final state is as described above.
