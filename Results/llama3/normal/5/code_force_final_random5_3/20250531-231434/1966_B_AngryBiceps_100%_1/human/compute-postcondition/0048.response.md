Let's analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration and the loop head to determine which states need to be adjusted.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, so `n` must be greater than 1.

The other variables (`m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, `stdin`, and `_`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing one line read from stdin, `first_row` is a string containing the first character of the line read from stdin, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of the line read from stdin, `stdin` contains t-n-1 test cases, `_` is 1**
