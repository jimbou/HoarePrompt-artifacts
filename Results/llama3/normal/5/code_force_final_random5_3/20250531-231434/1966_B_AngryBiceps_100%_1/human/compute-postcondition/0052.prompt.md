Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains t-n-1 test cases, _ is 1, i is n-1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 0, i is 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing one line read from stdin, first\_row is a string containing the first character of the line read from stdin, last\_row is a string containing the last character of the line read from stdin, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, \_ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 1, i is 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing two lines read from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the first line read from stdin and the first character of the second line read from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first line read from stdin and the last character of the second line read from stdin, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, a is a list containing three lines read from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the first line read from stdin, the first character of the second line read from stdin, and the first character of the third line read from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first line read from stdin, the last character of the second line read from stdin, and the last character of the third line read from stdin, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, _ is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
