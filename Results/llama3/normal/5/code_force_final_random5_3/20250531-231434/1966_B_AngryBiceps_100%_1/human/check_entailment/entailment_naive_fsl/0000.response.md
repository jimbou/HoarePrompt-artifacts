Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, consider the following input:

3 3
BBB
WBW
BBB

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program incorrectly assumes that if the first and last rows are the same color, or if the first and last columns are the same color, then it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. However, this is not always the case.

In this example, the first and last rows are both "BBB", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color because the middle row is "WBW", which cannot be changed to all "B"s or all "W"s by performing any number of operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
