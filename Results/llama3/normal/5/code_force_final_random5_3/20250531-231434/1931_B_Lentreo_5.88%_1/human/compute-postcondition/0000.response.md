The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state contains `t` test cases, the first integer is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^5), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.**
