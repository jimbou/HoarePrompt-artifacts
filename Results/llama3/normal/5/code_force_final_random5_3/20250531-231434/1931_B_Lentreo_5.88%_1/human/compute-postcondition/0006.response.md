Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 1 integer, if the first integer in the list is not 0, then curr is i - last more than its previous value, otherwise curr remains the same, last is an integer between 0 and 10^9***
