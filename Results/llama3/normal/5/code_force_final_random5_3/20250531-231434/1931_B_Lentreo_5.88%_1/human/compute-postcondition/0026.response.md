Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 1 integer, if the first integer in the list is not 0, then curr is set to the difference between the first integer and the last integer in the list, otherwise curr remains 0.***
