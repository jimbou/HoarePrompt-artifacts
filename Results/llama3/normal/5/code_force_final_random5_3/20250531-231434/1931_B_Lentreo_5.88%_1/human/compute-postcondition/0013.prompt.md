Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, last is an integer between 0 and 10^9, curr is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 1 integer, if the first integer in the list is not 0, then curr is i - last more than its previous value, otherwise curr remains the same, last is an integer between 0 and 10^9

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `curr` is increased by `i - last` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `curr` remains the same, `last` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `curr` is increased by `i - last` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `curr` remains the same, `last` is the second integer in the list `nums`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
