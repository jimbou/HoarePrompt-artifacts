Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The operation allows pouring any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j.

The given program calculates the sum of the differences between each integer in the list and the last integer in the list, excluding the last integer itself and any zeros. If this sum is 0, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The reasoning behind this approach is that if the sum of the differences is 0, it means that the total amount of water that needs to be poured from the left containers to the right containers is equal to the total amount of water that can be poured from the right containers to the left containers. This implies that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the left containers to the right containers.

On the other hand, if the sum of the differences is not 0, it means that there is a net amount of water that needs to be poured from the left containers to the right containers, but there is not enough water in the right containers to pour back to the left containers. This implies that it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
