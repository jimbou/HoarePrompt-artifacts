The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is an empty list, last is the last integer in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and if the sum of all i - last for all i in a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that i is not 0 is equal to 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
