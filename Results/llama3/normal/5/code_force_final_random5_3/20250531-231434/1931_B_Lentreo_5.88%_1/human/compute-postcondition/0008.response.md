Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `curr` is increased by `i - last`, `last` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `curr` is increased by the difference between the current index `i` and the first integer in the list `last`. The list `nums` remains the same, and `last` is still the first integer in the list. The number of test cases in the standard input is reduced by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
