Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is an empty list, last is the last integer in the original list, and curr is the sum of the differences between each integer in the list and the last integer in the list, excluding the last integer itself and any zeros. If curr is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The input stream `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases would have been processed. The variables `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` will retain their last values from the final iteration of the loop. The program will print 'YES' if the sum of the differences between each integer in the list and the last integer in the list (excluding the last integer itself and any zeros) is 0, and 'NO' otherwise.
