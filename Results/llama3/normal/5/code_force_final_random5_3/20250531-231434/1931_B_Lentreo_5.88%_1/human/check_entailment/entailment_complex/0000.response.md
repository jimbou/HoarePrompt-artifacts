Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`. It then calculates the sum of differences between each integer (excluding the last one and zeros) and the last integer in the list `curr`.

The key insight here is that if the sum of differences `curr` is zero, it means that the amount of water in all containers can be made the same by pouring water from one container to another. This is because the sum of differences represents the total amount of water that needs to be poured from one container to another to make all containers have the same amount of water. If this sum is zero, it means that no pouring is needed, and all containers already have the same amount of water.

The program correctly prints 'YES' if `curr` is zero and 'NO' otherwise, which is in line with the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
