The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list  nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list nums.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 2 integers, last is the second last integer in the list, i is the next integer in the list nums after the last integer last. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the last is the third last integer in the list and i is the next integer in the list nums after the last integer last.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and `nums` is not empty and has at least 3 integers, `last` is the third last integer in the list, `i` is the next integer in the list `nums` after the last integer `last`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is increased by the difference between the current integer `i` and the third last integer `last`, and `stdin` contains t-6 test cases. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
