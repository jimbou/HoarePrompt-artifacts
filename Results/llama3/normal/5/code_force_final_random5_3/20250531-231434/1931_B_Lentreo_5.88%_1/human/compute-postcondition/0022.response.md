Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, last is the last integer in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and curr is 0.**

The code reads two lines from stdin for a test case, assigns the first line to `n` and the second line to `nums` as a list of integers. It then assigns the last integer in `nums` to `last` and initializes `curr` to 0. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The state of stdin is updated to contain `t-3` test cases.
