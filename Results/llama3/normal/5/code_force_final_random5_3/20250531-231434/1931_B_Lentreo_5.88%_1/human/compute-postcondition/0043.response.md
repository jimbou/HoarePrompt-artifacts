Output State: **t is at least 3, _ is 2, curr is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, last is the last integer in the list, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

The code reads an integer n and a list of n integers from stdin, and assigns them to the variables n and nums, respectively. It then assigns the last integer in the list to the variable last. The variable curr is reset to 0. The value of t is not affected by the code, so it remains at least 3. The value of _ is also not affected, so it remains 2. The stdin now contains t-4 test cases.
