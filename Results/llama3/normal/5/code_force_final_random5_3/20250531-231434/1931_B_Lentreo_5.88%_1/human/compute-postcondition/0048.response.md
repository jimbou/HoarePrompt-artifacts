To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in nums:`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which takes on the value of each element in the list `nums` during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `t` is at least 3
* `_` is 2
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5
* `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and `nums` is not empty
* `last` is the last integer in the list
* `stdin` contains t-4 test cases
* If the first integer `i` in the list is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the list `nums`. Since `i` takes on the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration, we can adjust the state as follows:

* `i` is the next integer in the list `nums` after the last integer `last`

The other variables in the state (`t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `stdin`) are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and `nums` is not empty, `last` is the second last integer in the list, `i` is the next integer in the list `nums` after the last integer `last`, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases**
