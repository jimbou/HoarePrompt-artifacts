Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and `nums` is not empty, `last` is the second last integer in the list, `i` is the next integer in the list `nums` after the last integer `last`, `curr` is increased by the difference between the current integer `i` and the second last integer `last`, and `stdin` contains t-5 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `curr` is increased by the difference between the current integer `i` and the second last integer `last`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain the same. The number of test cases in `stdin` is decreased by 1.
