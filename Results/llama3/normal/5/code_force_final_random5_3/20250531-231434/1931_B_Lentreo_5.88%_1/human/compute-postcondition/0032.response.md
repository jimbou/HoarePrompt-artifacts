Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `curr` is updated to the difference between the first integer and the last integer in the list plus the second integer in the list minus the last integer if the first integer is not 0 and the second integer is not 0, otherwise `curr` remains 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 3 integers.***
