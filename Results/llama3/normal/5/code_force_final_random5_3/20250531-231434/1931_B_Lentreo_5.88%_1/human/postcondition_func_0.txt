This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It calculates the sum of differences between each integer (excluding the last one and zeros) and the last integer in the list. If this sum is zero, it prints 'YES', indicating that the list meets a certain condition. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
