Precondition: **stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
