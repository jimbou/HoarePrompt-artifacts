Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `curr` is increased by `i - last` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `curr` remains the same, `last` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.***
