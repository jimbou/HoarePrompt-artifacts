Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The key insight is that if the sum of the differences between each integer (excluding the last one and zeros) and the last integer in the list is zero, then it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. This is because the operation allows pouring water from one container to another, and the sum of the differences represents the total amount of water that needs to be poured.

The program correctly calculates this sum and checks if it is zero. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that the list meets the condition. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the last integer in the list is zero, by excluding it from the calculation.

Correctness: **True**
