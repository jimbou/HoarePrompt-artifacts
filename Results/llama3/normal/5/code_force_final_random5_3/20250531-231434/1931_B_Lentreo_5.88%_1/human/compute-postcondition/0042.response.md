The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and `t` is at least 3.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each integer in the list and the last integer in the list, excluding the last integer itself and any zeros, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is an empty list. If `curr` is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
