Output State: **`t` is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 2 integers, if the first integer in the list is not 0, then curr is set to the difference between the first integer and the last integer in the list plus i minus last, otherwise curr remains 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `curr` has been updated. If the first integer in the list `nums` is not 0, `curr` is now the difference between the first integer and the last integer in the list plus `i` minus `last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0. The values of the other variables and the input in stdin remain unchanged.
