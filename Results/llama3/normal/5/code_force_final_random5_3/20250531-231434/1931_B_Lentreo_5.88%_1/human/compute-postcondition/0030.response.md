The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, nums has at least 2 integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers.
State: **`t` is at least 2, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 3 integers. If the first integer in the list is not 0, then curr is set to the difference between the first integer and the last integer in the list plus i minus last if i is not 0, otherwise curr remains 0, i is the second integer in the list.**
