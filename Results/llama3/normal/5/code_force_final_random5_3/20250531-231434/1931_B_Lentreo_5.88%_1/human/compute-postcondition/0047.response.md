Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and `nums` is not empty, `last` is the last integer in the list, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases. If the first integer `i` in the list is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.***
