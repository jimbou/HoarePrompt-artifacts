To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in nums:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of the list `nums`.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `t` is at least 1
* `_` is 0
* `curr` is increased by `i - last` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `curr` remains the same
* `last` is the first integer in the list `nums`
* `nums` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that must have at least 2 integers
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5
* stdin contains `t-3` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* `i` is the next element in the list `nums`. Since `last` is the first integer in the list, `i` will be the second integer in the list.
* `curr` is updated based on the value of `i` and `last`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is increased by `i - last`.
* `nums` must have at least 2 integers, so we can assume that the list has at least two elements.

Based on this analysis, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `curr` is increased by `i - last` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `curr` remains the same, `last` is the second integer in the list `nums`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.**
