Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each integer in the list and the last integer in the list, excluding the last integer itself and any zeros, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is an empty list. If `curr` is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
