Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each integer in the list and the last integer in the list, excluding the last integer itself and any zeros, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is an empty list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that `curr` has accumulated the sum of the differences between each non-zero integer in the list and the last integer in the list, excluding the last integer itself and any zeros. The list `nums` is now empty, indicating that all integers have been processed. The other variables `_` and `stdin` remain unchanged, with `_` still being 1 and `stdin` containing the remaining test cases.
