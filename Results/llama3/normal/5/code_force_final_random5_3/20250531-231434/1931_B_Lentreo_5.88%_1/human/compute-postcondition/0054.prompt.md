Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 3, _ is 2, curr is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, last is the last integer in the list, stdin contains t-4 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and `nums` is not empty, `last` is the last integer in the list, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases. If the first integer `i` in the list is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and `nums` is not empty, `last` is the second last integer in the list, `i` is the next integer in the list `nums` after the last integer `last`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is increased by the difference between the current integer `i` and the second last integer `last`, and `stdin` contains t-5 test cases. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n and `nums` is not empty and has at least 3 integers, `last` is the third last integer in the list, `i` is the next integer in the list `nums` after the last integer `last`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is increased by the difference between the current integer `i` and the third last integer `last`. The state of the variables remains unchanged if `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-6 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
