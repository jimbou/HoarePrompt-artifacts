Postcondition: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is an empty list, last is the last integer in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and the current value of curr is 0, which means the sum of all i - last for all i in a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that i is not 0 is equal to 0.**
