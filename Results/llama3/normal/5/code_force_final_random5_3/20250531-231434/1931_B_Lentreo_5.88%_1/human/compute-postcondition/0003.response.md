The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable nums. If nums has at least 1 integer the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, last is an integer between 0 and 10^9, curr is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to nums is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer and i is now the first integer in the list.
