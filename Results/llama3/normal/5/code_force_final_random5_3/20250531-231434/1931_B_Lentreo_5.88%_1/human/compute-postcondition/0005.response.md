Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `curr` is `i - last` more than its previous value, `i` is not 0, `last` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `nums` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `curr` has increased by the difference between `i` and `last`. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `last`, `nums`, `n`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
