Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the third value in the `cnt` dictionary, `ans` is equal to the initial value of `ans` (which is 0) plus the integer division of the first value in `cnt` by 3 plus the integer division of the second value in `cnt` by 3 plus the integer division of the third value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the integer division of the third value in the `cnt` dictionary by 3 to its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.
