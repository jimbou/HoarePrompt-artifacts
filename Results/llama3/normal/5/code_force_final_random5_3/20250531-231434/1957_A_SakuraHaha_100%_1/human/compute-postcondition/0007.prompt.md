Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1 plus the previous value of `x` in `cnt` (or 1 if `x` was not in `cnt` before)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the first integer in `a` as a key and its value is 1, and the second integer in `a` as a key and its value is 2 plus its previous value (or 2 if it was not in `cnt` before)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the first integer in `a` as a key and its value is 1, the second integer in `a` as a key and its value is 2 plus its previous value (or 2 if it was not in `cnt` before), the third integer in `a` as a key and its value is 4 plus its previous value (or 4 if it was not in `cnt` before), and any other key-value pairs that were in `cnt` before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
