Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the code has processed one test case from the input. The value of `n` is now an integer, and the list `a` contains `n` integers. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and the dictionary `cnt` is empty. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each with two inputs: an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n`.
