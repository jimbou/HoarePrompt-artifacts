The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is calculated as the initial value of `ans` (0) plus the sum of the integer division of all values in the `cnt` dictionary by 3.

Since `cnt` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appeared in the original list, the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3 will give the number of times each integer can be divided into groups of 3.

The sum of these integer divisions will give the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the integers in the original list.

Therefore, the value of `ans` will be the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the integers in the original list.

Output: **the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the integers in the original list**
