Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Annotated Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, a is an empty list, x is the last integer in the original list, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appeared in the original list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, a is an empty list, x is the last value in the cnt dictionary, ans is equal to the initial value of ans (which is 0) plus the sum of the integer division of all values in cnt by 3, cnt is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appeared in the original list.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the integers in the original list

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a list of integers from standard input, counts the occurrences of each integer, and calculates the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from these integers. It then prints this total count. The function processes one test case at a time, with the number of test cases specified at the beginning of the input.
