Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

4
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

The program will output 2, but the correct output is 2. However, the program does not consider the case where we can make a pentagon with side length 2 and a square of side length 4. The program only counts the number of sticks that can be divided into groups of 3, but it does not consider other possible combinations.

The program should be modified to consider all possible combinations of sticks that can form regular polygons.
