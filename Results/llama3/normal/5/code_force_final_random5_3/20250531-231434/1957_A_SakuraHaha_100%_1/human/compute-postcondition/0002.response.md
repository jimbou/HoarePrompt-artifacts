Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1 plus the previous value of `x` in `cnt` (or 1 if `x` was not in `cnt` before)**

In natural language, the output state is: The code increments the count of the first integer `x` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. If `x` was not in `cnt` before, its count is set to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
