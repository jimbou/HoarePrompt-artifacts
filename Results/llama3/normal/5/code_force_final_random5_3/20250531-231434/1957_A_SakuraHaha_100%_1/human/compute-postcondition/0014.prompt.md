Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, a is an empty list, x is the last integer in the original list, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their values are the number of times each integer appeared in the original list.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the first value in the `cnt` dictionary, `ans` is equal to the initial value of `ans` (which is 0) plus the integer division of `x` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the second value in the `cnt` dictionary, `ans` is equal to the initial value of `ans` (which is 0) plus the integer division of the first value in `cnt` by 3 plus the integer division of the second value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the third value in the `cnt` dictionary, `ans` is equal to the initial value of `ans` (which is 0) plus the integer division of the first value in `cnt` by 3 plus the integer division of the second value in `cnt` by 3 plus the integer division of the third value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least 3 key-value pairs




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
