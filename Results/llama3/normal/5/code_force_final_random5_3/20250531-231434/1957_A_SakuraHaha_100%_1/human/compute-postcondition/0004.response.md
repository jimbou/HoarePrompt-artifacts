Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the first integer in `a` as a key and its value is 1, and the second integer in `a` as a key and its value is 2 plus its previous value (or 2 if it was not in `cnt` before)**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been updated to be one more than its previous value. Since `x` is the second integer in the list `a`, its count in the dictionary `cnt` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
