Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the first integer in `a` as a key and its value is 1, the second integer in `a` as a key and its value is 2 plus its previous value (or 2 if it was not in `cnt` before), the third integer in `a` as a key and its value is 4 plus its previous value (or 4 if it was not in `cnt` before), and any other key-value pairs that were in `cnt` before.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1. Since `x` is the third integer in the list `a`, its value in `cnt` was previously 3 plus its previous value (or 3 if it was not in `cnt` before). Now, its value is 4 plus its previous value (or 4 if it was not in `cnt` before). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
