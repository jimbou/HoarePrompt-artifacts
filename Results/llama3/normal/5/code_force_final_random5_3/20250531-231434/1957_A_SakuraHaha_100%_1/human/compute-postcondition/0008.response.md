To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `cnt`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the values of the `cnt` dictionary. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must have at least one value. Since `cnt` is a dictionary with integers from the original list as keys and their counts as values, we can adjust the state of `cnt` to have at least one key-value pair.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the first value in the cnt dictionary, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair**
