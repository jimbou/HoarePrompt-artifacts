The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
