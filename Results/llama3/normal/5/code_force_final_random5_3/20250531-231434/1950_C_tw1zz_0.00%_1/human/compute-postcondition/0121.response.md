Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '09', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is 'PM', _ is 1, and t must be greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM**

The code assigns the string '09' to `h1` and the string 'PM' to `time`. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state of `h`, `m`, `m1`, `_`, and `t` remains unchanged, and stdin still contains a string representing time in the format HH:MM.
