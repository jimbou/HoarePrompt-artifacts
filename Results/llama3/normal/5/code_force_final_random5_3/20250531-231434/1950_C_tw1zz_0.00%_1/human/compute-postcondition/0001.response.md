Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is an empty string, m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, time is an empty string, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format.**

Explanation: The first line reads a string from stdin in the format hh:mm and splits it into two parts, assigning the hour part to `h` and the minute part to `m`. The second line assigns an empty string to `h1` and the value of `m` to `m1`. The third line assigns an empty string to `time`. The value of `_` remains unchanged as 0. Since the first line reads one string from stdin, there are now t-1 strings left in stdin.
