    #State: The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop has finished executing.

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format and prints the converted time. The function accepts a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) followed by t strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format from standard input, and prints the corresponding time in 12-hour format (hh:mm AM/PM) for each input time.
