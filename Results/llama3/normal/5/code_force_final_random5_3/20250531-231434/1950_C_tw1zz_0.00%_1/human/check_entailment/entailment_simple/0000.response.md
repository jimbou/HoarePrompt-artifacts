Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format. The program takes a string input in the format "hh:mm" and outputs the equivalent time in 12-hour format.

The program uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format and whether it's AM or PM. The minutes remain the same.

However, there is a logical error in the program. When the hour is '00', the program sets the time to 'PM', which is incorrect. '00' in 24-hour format corresponds to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
