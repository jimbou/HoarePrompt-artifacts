Reasoning: 

The provided Python program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format. It takes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) followed by t strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format from standard input. The program then prints the corresponding time in 12-hour format (hh:mm AM/PM) for each input time.

The program uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format and whether it is AM or PM. However, this approach is not efficient and can be simplified.

Despite the inefficiency, the program correctly handles all possible input hours from 00 to 23 and converts them to the corresponding 12-hour format. It also correctly determines whether the time is AM or PM.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the program is correct in terms of its functionality.

Correctness: **True**
