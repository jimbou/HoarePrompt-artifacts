Postcondition: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format. If h is '22', then h1 is '10', time is 'PM', and m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format. If h is '23', then h1 is '11', time is 'PM', and m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format. If h is '00', then h1 is '12', time is 'PM', and m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format. For all other values of h, the values of h1, time, and m1 are not modified. In all cases, _ is 1, t is greater than 1, and stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM.**
