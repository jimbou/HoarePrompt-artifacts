Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the hour is '00' correctly. According to the problem description, '00' should be converted to '12' and the time should be 'AM', but the program converts it to '12' and the time to 'PM'. 

For example, if the input is '00:59', the program will output '12:59 PM', but the correct output should be '12:59 AM'.
