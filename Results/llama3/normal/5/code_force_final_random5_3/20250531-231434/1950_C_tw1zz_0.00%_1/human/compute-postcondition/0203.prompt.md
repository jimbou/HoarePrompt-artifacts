Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) followed by t strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
    h1, m1 = '', m
    time = ''
    if h == '01':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '02':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '03':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '04':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '05':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '06':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '07':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '08':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '09':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '10':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '11':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '12':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '13':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '14':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '15':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '16':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '17':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '18':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '19':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '20':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '21':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '22':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '23':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '00':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'PM'
    print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is a string representing the time of day (AM/PM), and _ is 0. If h is '01', then h1 is '01', m1 is the same as m, and time is 'AM'. If h is not '01', then if h is '02', h1 is '02', m1 is the same as m, and time is 'AM'. If h is not '02', then if h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', h1 is the same as h, m1 is the same as m, and time is 'AM'. If h is not '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then if h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', h1 and m1 are the same as h and m respectively, and time is 'PM'. If h is '00', then time is 'PM'. stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format. The time in 12-hour format is printed, where the hour part is represented by h1, the minute part is represented by m, and the time of day is represented by time.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 1, t is greater than 1, and stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM. If h is '01', then h1 is '01', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, and time is 'AM'. If h is '02', then h1 is '02', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, and time is 'AM'. If h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then h1 is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, and time is 'AM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, time is 'PM', and m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format. The time in 12-hour format is being printed in the format h1:m:time.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, _ is 2, t is greater than 2. If h is '01', then h1 is '01', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, and time is 'AM'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then h1 is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, and time is 'AM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, and time is 'PM'. Otherwise, h1, m1, and time remain unchanged, and this is printed: the time in 12-hour format, with h1 representing the hour part, m representing the minute part, and time representing whether it is AM or PM




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
