Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '07', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is 'AM', _ is 1, and t must be greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM**

The code snippet assigns the value '07' to h1 and 'AM' to time. The values of h, m, m1, _, and t remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. Stdin still contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM.
