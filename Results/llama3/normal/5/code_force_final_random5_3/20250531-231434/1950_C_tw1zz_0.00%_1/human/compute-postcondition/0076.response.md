If h is '21', then h1 is '09' and time is 'PM'. If h is '22', then h1 is '10' and time is 'PM'. If h is '23', then h1 is '11' and time is 'PM'. If h is not '21', '22', or '23', then h1 is the same as h, and time is 'AM' if h is not '00', otherwise time is 'PM' if h is '00'. stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format.***
