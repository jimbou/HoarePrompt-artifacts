Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to 12-hour format. It takes a string input in the format "hh:mm" and outputs the equivalent time in 12-hour format.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each case.
2. For each test case, it reads a string input in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into hours (h) and minutes (m).
3. It then checks the value of the hour (h) and assigns the corresponding 12-hour format hour (h1) and time of day (time) based on the hour.
4. If the hour is between 01 and 11, it assigns the same hour to h1 and sets the time to 'AM'.
5. If the hour is 12, it assigns 12 to h1 and sets the time to 'AM'.
6. If the hour is between 13 and 23, it subtracts 12 from the hour to get the 12-hour format hour (h1) and sets the time to 'PM'.
7. If the hour is 00, it assigns 12 to h1 and sets the time to 'PM'.
8. Finally, it prints the 12-hour format time in the format "hh:mm time".

However, there is a logical error in the program. When the hour is 00, it should be assigned to 'AM', not 'PM'. This is because 00:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
