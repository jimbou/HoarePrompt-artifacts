Output State: **The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop has finished executing.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the program has moved on to the next part of the code. The values of the variables inside the loop have been updated according to the loop's logic, but the state of the other variables outside the loop remains unchanged.
