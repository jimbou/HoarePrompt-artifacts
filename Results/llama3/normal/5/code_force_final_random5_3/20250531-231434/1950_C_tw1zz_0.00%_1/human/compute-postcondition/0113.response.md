The code snippet consists of two lines that assign new values to the variables `h1` and `time`. The first line assigns the string `'01'` to `h1`, and the second line assigns the string `'PM'` to `time`. 

The initial values of `h`, `m`, `m1`, `_`, and `t` are not affected by the code snippet, and stdin remains unchanged as no input operation is performed.

Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '01', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is 'PM', _ is 1, and t is greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM**
