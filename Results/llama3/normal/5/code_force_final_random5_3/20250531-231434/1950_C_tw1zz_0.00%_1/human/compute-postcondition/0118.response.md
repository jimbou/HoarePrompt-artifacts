The code snippet assigns the value '06' to `h1` and 'PM' to `time`. The initial values of `h`, `m`, `m1`, and `_` are not affected by the code, and `t` is not mentioned in the code snippet. Stdin still contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM.

Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '06', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is 'PM', _ is 1, t must be greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM**
