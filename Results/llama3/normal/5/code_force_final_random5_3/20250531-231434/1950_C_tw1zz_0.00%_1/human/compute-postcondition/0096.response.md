Postcondition: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is a string representing the time of day (AM/PM), and _ is 0. If h is '01', then h1 is '01', m1 is the same as m, and time is 'AM'. If h is not '01', then if h is '02', h1 is '02', m1 is the same as m, and time is 'AM'. If h is not '02', then if h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', h1 is the same as h, m1 is the same as m, and time is 'AM'. If h is not '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then if h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', h1 and m1 are the same as h and m respectively, and time is 'PM'. If h is '00', then time is 'PM'. stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format.**
