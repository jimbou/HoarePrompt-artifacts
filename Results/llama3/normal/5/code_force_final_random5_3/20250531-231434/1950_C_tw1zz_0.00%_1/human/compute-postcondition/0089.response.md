Postcondition: ***h and m are strings representing the hour and minute parts of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 and m1 are strings representing the hour and minute parts of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is a string representing the time of day (AM/PM), and _ is 0. If h is '08', then h1 is '08', m1 is the same as m, and time is 'AM'. If h is not '08', then if h is '09', then h1 is '09', m1 is the same as m, and time is 'AM'. If h is not '09', then if h is '10', '11', or '12', h1 is the same as h, m1 is the same as m, and time is 'AM'. If h is not '10', '11', or '12', then h1 and m1 are the same as h and m respectively, and time is 'PM' if h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', otherwise time is 'AM' if h is not '00', otherwise time is 'PM' if h is '00'. stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format.***
