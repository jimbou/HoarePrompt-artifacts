If h is '16', then h1 is '04', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, and time is 'PM'. If h is '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then h1 is '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, time is 'PM', and m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format. For all other values of h, the values of h1, time, and m1 are not modified.**
