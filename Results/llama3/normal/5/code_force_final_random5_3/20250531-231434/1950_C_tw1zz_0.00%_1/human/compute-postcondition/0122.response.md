Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '10', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is 'PM', _ is 1, and t must be greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `h`, `m`, `m1`, `_`, or `t`, nor does it consume any input from stdin. The only changes are the assignments of the string '10' to `h1` and the string 'PM' to `time`. All other variables and the state of stdin remain unchanged.
