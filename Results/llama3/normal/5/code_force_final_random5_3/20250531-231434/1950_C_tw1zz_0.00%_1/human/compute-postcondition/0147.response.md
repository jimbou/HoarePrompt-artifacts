If h is not '02', then if h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then h1 is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, and time is 'AM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, time is 'PM', and m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format.**
