The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `h1` and `time`. The first line assigns the string `'12'` to `h1`, and the second line assigns the string `'PM'` to `time`. 

The initial state of `h1` is an empty string, and the initial state of `time` is also an empty string. After the code executes, `h1` becomes `'12'`, and `time` becomes `'PM'`. The values of other variables, such as `h`, `m`, `m1`, `_`, and `t`, remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The state of stdin also remains the same, containing 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM.

Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '12', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is 'PM', _ is 1, t is greater than 1, and stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM.**
