Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '11', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is 'PM', _ is 1, and t must be greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign new values to the variables `h1` and `time`. The first line sets `h1` to the string '11', and the second line sets `time` to the string 'PM'. These assignments do not affect the values of any other variables. The initial values of `h`, `m`, `m1`, `_`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the input in stdin remains the same.
