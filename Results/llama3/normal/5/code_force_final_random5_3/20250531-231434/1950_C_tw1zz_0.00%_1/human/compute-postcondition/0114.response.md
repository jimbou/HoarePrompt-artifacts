Output State: **h is a string representing the hour part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, m is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 24-hour format, h1 is '02', m1 is a string representing the minute part of a valid time in the 12-hour format, time is 'PM', _ is 1, and t must be greater than 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string '02' to the variable h1. The second line assigns the string 'PM' to the variable time. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state of the variables h, m, m1, _, and t remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The stdin still contains 1 input: a string representing time in the format HH:MM, as it is not affected by the code.
