The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the return value of `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `int(input())`. If the return value of `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) followed by t strings of length 5 with format hh:mm representing valid times in the 24-hour format. So for the loop to be executed, the return value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
