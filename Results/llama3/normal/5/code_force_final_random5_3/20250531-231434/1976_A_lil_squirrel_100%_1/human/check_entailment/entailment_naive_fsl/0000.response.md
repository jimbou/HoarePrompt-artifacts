Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if a given password is strong according to the problem description. It first separates the password into letters and digits, then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. It also checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter, which is not allowed.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords with a mix of letters and digits. It also correctly handles passwords with repeated letters or digits.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem. Therefore, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and hence the program is correct.
