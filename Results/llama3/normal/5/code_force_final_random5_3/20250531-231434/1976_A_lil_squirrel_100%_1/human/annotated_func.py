    #State: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list containing all the letters in the password, digits is a list containing all the digits in the password. The list of letters is sorted in ascending order. The list of digits is sorted in ascending order.

    #State: The program returns 'NO' if the password contains a letter followed by a digit at any position, otherwise it continues executing, `i` is equal to `len(password) - 1`.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES' because the password does not contain a letter followed by a digit at any position.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if a given password meets certain conditions and returns 'YES' if it does, otherwise returns 'NO'. The conditions are: (1) the letters in the password are in ascending order, (2) the digits in the password are in ascending order, and (3) there is no letter followed by a digit at any position in the password.
