Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is an empty list, digits is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isdigit():
        digits.append(ch)
    else:
        letters.append(ch)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of the password is a digit, then digits is a list containing this digit and letters is an empty list. If the first character of the password is not a digit, then letters is a list containing this character and digits is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, if the second character of the password is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first digit and the second digit and the second digit is repeated, and letters is a list containing the second digit. If the second character of the password is not a digit, then letters is a list containing the first letter, the second letter and the second letter and digits is a list containing the second digit, ch is the second character in the password.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, `ch` is the third character in the password. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the third character of the password. Otherwise, `letters` is a list containing the third character of the password.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
