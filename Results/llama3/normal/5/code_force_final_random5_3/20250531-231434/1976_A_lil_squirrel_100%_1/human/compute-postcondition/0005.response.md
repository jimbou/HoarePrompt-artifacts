Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `ch` is the first character in the password and it is not a digit.**

In this output state, the code has appended the first character of the password, which is not a digit, to the `letters` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `password` still has the same length and composition, and the `digits` list is still empty. The `ch` variable still holds the first character of the password, which is not a digit.
