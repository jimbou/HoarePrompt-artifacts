Reasoning: 
The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description and its execution summary. The program checks if a given password meets the specified conditions: (1) the letters in the password are in ascending order, (2) the digits in the password are in ascending order, and (3) there is no letter followed by a digit at any position in the password. It correctly implements these conditions by separating the letters and digits, checking if they are sorted, and verifying that no letter is followed by a digit. The program returns 'YES' if the password meets all conditions and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
