The only variable in the loop head is variable  ch and password, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password.  If the password has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, password has at least 1 character, if the first character of the password is a digit, then digits is a list containing this digit and letters is an empty list. If the first character of the password is not a digit, then letters is a list containing this character and digits is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the password must have at least 2 characters and the ch is the second character in the password. If the second character of the password is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first digit and the second digit and letters is an empty list. If the second character of the password is not a digit, then letters is a list containing the first letter and the second letter and digits is an empty list.
State: **n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, if the second character of the password is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first digit and the second digit and letters is an empty list. If the second character of the password is not a digit, then letters is a list containing the first letter and the second letter and digits is an empty list, ch is the second character in the password.**
