Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately checks all the conditions specified in the problem description. 

1. It checks if the letters in the password are in ascending order by comparing the list of letters with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.

2. It checks if the digits in the password are in ascending order by comparing the list of digits with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.

3. It checks if there is a letter followed by a digit at any position in the password by iterating over the password and checking if the current character is a letter and the next character is a digit. If such a pair is found, it returns 'NO'.

If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

Correctness: **True**
