The code `letters.append(ch)` adds the third character of the password to the list `letters`. Since `ch` is the third character in the password, it is a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The length of the password is `n`, which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3. The values of `n` and `password` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the third character in the password, and `letters` is a list containing the third character of the password.**
