Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly checks all the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement.

1. The program first separates the letters and digits in the password into two separate lists.

2. It then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in ascending order. If either of them is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

3. After that, it checks if there is a letter followed by a digit in the password. If it finds such a pair, it returns 'NO'.

4. If the program passes all the checks, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the problem constraints. It assumes that the input is valid as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
