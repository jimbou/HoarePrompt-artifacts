The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and password, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `password`. If `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `password` is some string. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `password` must be at least 2 characters longer than `i`.
State: **The program returns 'NO' if the password contains a letter followed by a digit at positions i and i+1, otherwise it continues executing, `i` is increased by 1, `password` must be at least 2 characters longer than `i`**
