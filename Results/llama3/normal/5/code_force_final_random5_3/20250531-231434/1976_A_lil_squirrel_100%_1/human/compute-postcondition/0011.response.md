To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `ch` and `password`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more characters in the `password` string. Since the second character of the password has already been processed, we need to move to the next character.

If the second character of the password is a digit, then `digits` contains the first digit and the second digit, and the second digit is repeated. To adjust the state, we need to move to the next character in the password, which means `ch` should be the third character in the password. Since the password has at least 2 characters, it must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute again.

If the second character of the password is not a digit, then `letters` contains the first letter, the second letter, and the second letter, and `digits` contains the second digit. Again, to adjust the state, we need to move to the next character in the password, which means `ch` should be the third character in the password. Since the password has at least 2 characters, it must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute again.

In both cases, the state of `n` remains the same, as it is not affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, `ch` is the third character in the password**
