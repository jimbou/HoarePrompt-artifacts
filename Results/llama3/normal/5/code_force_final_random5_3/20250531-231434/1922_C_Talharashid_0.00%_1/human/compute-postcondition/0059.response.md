Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of `lst` and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s` + 1, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `start` is less than `end`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start` + `inc` in `lst` and 11111111, `s` is `s` + 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
