Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst, otherwise it remains the same.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the additional condition that start is equal to end. This means that the loop has finished executing and the final values of the variables in the loop head and body have been reached. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
