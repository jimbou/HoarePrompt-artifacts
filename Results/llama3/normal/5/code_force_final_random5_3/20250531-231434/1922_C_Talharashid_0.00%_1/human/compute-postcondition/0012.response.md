Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `s` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element of `lst` and the previous value of `mini` if `start` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` if `lst` has at least 2 elements, otherwise `mini` is 11111111. The current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
