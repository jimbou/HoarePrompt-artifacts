The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is not equal to end and is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time start must not be equal to end.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 2, i is m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is start + 1 and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers with length greater than 1, end is the integer value of len(lst) - 1, inc is 1, m is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, start must not be equal to end**
