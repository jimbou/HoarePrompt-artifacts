Output State: **`start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst` up to index `i`, and `m` is an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, and `d2` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `m`, which is assigned an integer value from the input.
