Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of `lst` and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is `start` and the value is `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `start` is less than `end`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start - 1` in `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start - 1` in `lst` and the previous value of `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start - 1` in `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
