Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst, otherwise it remains the same, m is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of m is assigned the integer value from the input, but since the stdin contains no input after this operation, it is not included in the output state. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
