This function calculates and prints the minimum cost of traversing a list of integers from a given start index to a given end index, considering two possible traversal directions (forward and backward) and taking into account the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list. The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers and a set of start-end index pairs, and prints the minimum cost for each pair.
