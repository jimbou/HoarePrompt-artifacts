Output: **start is an integer minus one, end is an integer minus one, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end]. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index end and the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index start, s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index start and the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed**
