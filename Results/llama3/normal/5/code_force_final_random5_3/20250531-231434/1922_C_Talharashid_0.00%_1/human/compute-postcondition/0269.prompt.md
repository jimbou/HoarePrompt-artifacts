Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start is the last index of lst, end is 0, inc is -1, s is 0, and all other variables (t, i, d2, n, lst, m) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: start is the last index of lst minus 1, end is less than the last index of lst, inc is -1. mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111 if start is less than the length of lst minus 1. Otherwise, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s if the current value of mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. Otherwise, s is 1. d2[start] is the value of s. All other variables (t, i, n, lst, m) remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: start is the last index of lst minus 2, end is greater than or equal to the last index of lst minus 2, inc is -1. If start is 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111. If start is not 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1], the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1], and 11111111. s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s if the current value of mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. Otherwise, s is 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 1. d2[start] is the value of s if mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise d2[start] is the value of the previous s. d2[start + 1] is the value of s. All other variables (t, i, n, lst, m) remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: start is the last index of lst minus 3, end is not equal to the last index of lst minus 3, inc is -1. If start - 1 is greater than -1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111 if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus 1 if the current value of mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is 2 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 2. d2[start] is the value of s if mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise d2[start] is the value of the previous s. d2[start + 1] is the value of s if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise d2[start + 1] remains unchanged. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. All other variables (t, i, n, lst, m) remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
