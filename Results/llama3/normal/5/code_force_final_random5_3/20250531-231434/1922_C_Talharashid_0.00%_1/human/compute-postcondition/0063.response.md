The variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is less than end and equal to start + inc, and inc is -1, So for the loop to be executed one more time start must be less than end.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is less than end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and 11111111, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s**
