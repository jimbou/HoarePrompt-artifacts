Output State: **`start` is the last index of `lst`, `end` is less than the last index of `lst`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 1. If `start` is 0, `mini` remains 11111111. If `start` is larger than 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111 if `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111. The current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. All other variables (t, i, d2, n, lst, m) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is still equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, and its value depends on the value of `start`. The values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, and all other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
