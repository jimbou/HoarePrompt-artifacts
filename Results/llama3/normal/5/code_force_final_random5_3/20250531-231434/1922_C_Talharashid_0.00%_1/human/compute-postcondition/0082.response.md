Output: **the minimum of the absolute difference between the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst from index start to end and the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst from index 0 to start, and the absolute difference between the value of d2 at index start and the value of d2 at index end, if start is less than end; otherwise, the minimum of the absolute difference between the value of d2 at index end and the value of d2 at index start, and the absolute difference between the value of d1 at index start and the value of d1 at index end**
