Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is 1, end is greater than 0, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise mini is 11111111, s is the sum of the absolute differences between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] for all start from 0 to end - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than `m + 1`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as `m + 1`.
- The dictionary `d1` now has key-value pairs with keys ranging from 0 to `end` (inclusive) and values representing the cumulative sum `s` at each index.
- The dictionary `d2` remains unchanged with a default value of 0 and no key-value pairs.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer.
- The list `lst` remains unchanged with at least 2 elements.
- The value of `inc` remains unchanged as 1.
- The value of `end` remains unchanged as greater than 0.
- The value of `start` is now equal to `end`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The value of `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` if `start - 1` is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111.
- The value of `s` is the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` for all `start` from 0 to `end - 1`.
