Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum cost of traversing a list of integers from a given start index to a given end index, considering two possible traversal directions (forward and backward) and taking into account the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list.

The program first initializes two dictionaries, d1 and d2, to store the cumulative sums of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list for forward and backward traversals, respectively. It then calculates these cumulative sums by iterating over the list in both forward and backward directions.

For each query, the program calculates the minimum cost by comparing the absolute differences between the cumulative sums for forward and backward traversals. It correctly handles the cases where the start index is less than the end index and vice versa.

The program also correctly processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers and a set of start-end index pairs, and prints the minimum cost for each pair.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
