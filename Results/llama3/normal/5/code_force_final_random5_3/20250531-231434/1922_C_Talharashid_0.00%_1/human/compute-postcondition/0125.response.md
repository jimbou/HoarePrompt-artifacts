The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value plus 1 and start must be less than end. So for the loop to be executed one more time start must be less than end. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has a new key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + 1` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s`. `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `end` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value plus 1 and `start` must be less than `end`, `start` must be less than `end`**
