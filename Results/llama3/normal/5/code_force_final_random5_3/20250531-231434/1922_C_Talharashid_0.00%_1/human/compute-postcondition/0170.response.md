Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values `s + 2` or `s + 3` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values `s + 1` or `s + 2`. `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + 2` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + 1`. `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `start` is now `start + inc`. `d2[start]` is now `s`. `mini` is now the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111.**

The code increments `start` by `inc`, which is -1, so `start` moves to the previous index. Then, it assigns the current value of `s` to `d2[start]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111.
