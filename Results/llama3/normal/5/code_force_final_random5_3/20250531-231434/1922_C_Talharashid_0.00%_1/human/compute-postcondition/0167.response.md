Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values `s + 2` or `s + 3` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values `s + 1` or `s + 2`. `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + 2` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + 1`. `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `start` is not 0. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is now the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111. If `start` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. If `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `start` is now `start + inc`, and `d2[start]` is now `s`. `mini` is now the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `inc`, and `start` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` have been updated accordingly based on the new value of `s`. The conditions for `mini` and the updates to `start` and `d2` remain the same as before.
