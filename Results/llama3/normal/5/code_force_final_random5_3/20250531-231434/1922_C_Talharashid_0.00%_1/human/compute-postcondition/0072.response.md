Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst, otherwise the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is less than end and is now equal to start + inc, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst, otherwise it remains the same.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc`, which is -1, effectively decrementing `start` by 1. Then, it assigns the value of `s` to `d2[start]`. The value of `s` is determined by whether `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in `lst`. If they are equal, `s` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains the same. The value of `mini` is updated based on the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start - 1` in `lst` and the previous value of `mini`, but only if `start - 1` is greater than -1.
