Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is -1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, m must be greater than 2, stdin contains no input, start is an integer equal to the first input minus 1, end is an integer equal to the second input minus 1. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst from start to end, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at start and the value of d2 at end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at key end and the value of d2 at key start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at key start and the value of d1 at key end.***
