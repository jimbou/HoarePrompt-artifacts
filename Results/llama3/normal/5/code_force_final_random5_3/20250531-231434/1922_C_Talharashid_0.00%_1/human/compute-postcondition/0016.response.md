Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and an additional key-value pair where the key is start + inc and the value is s, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the original start value plus inc.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been incremented by `inc`, which is 1. The dictionary `d1` now has an additional key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`. The value of `s` is determined by the condition in the initial state, which compares the minimum of the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element of `lst` and the previous value of `mini` with the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in `lst`. If they are equal, `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` is the absolute difference between the first element and the second element of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
