Output State: **start is the last index of lst minus 1, end is less than the last index of lst, inc is -1. mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111 if start is less than the length of lst minus 1. Otherwise, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s if the current value of mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. Otherwise, s is 1. d2[start] is the value of s. All other variables (t, i, n, lst, m) remain unchanged.**
