Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, start is 0, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, s is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pair where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is the previous value of start plus inc, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the previous value of mini if start is greater than 0, otherwise mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and 11111111, s is 1 if the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst is equal to mini, otherwise s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is less than end and equal to start + inc, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and 11111111, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst, otherwise the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is less than end and is now equal to start + inc, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst, otherwise it remains the same.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
