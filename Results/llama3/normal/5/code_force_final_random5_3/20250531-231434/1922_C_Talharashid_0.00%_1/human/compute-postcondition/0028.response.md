Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and an additional key-value pair where the key is `start` + `inc` and the value is `s` plus either 1 or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, and another key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `start` is the original start value plus 3 times `inc` and `start` must be less than the length of `lst` minus 1, `mini` is 11111111.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `inc`, and `start` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `mini` is now set to 11111111.
