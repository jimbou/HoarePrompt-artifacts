Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, start is 0, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, s is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, and `s`. The first line sets `start` to the length of `lst` minus 1, effectively reversing its original value. The second line sets `end` to 0, changing its original value. The third line sets `inc` to -1, reversing its original value. The fourth line sets `s` to 0, resetting its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
