Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than `m` + 1, `i` is `m` + 1, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `end` is greater than 0, `s` is 0. If `start` is greater than -1, `start` is greater than -1 and `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. Otherwise, `start` is -1 and `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`.***
