Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1. If the minimum of the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element of `lst` and the previous value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in `lst`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is the absolute difference between the first element and the second element of `lst`.***
