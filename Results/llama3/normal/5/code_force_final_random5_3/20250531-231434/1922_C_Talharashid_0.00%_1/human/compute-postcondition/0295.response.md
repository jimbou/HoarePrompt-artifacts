Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to t, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is -1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, stdin contains no input, start is an integer equal to the first input minus 1, end is an integer equal to the second input minus 1. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst from start to end, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at start and the value of d2 at end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at key end and the value of d2 at key start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at key start and the value of d1 at key end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and the variables have reached their final state. The loop counter `i` is equal to the total number of test cases `t`. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` contain the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list `lst` for each index. The variable `n` is an integer, and the list `lst` has at least 2 elements. The variable `inc` is -1, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the list in reverse order. The variable `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start - 1` in `lst` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1` is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111. The variable `s` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished calculating the cumulative sums. The standard input `stdin` contains no input, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `start` and `end` are integers equal to the first and second inputs minus 1, respectively. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst` from `start` to `end`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between the value of `d2` at `start` and the value of `d2` at `end`. Otherwise, `s1` is the absolute difference between the value of `d2` at key `end` and the value of `d2` at key `start`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between the value of `d1` at key `start` and the value of `d1` at key `end`, and the minimum of `s1` and `s2` is printed.
