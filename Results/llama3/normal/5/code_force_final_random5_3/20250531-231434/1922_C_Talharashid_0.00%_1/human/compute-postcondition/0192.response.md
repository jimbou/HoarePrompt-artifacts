Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is 2, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s + len(lst) - 1, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs with keys from 0 to len(lst) - 1 and values s + len(lst) - 1, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is an integer, inc is -1, start is an integer, s is 0, m is an integer input from the user and greater than 2, start is the integer value from the input minus 1, end is the integer value from the input minus 1, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the values of dictionaries `d2` and `d1` at specific keys (`end` and `start`) and assigns these differences to new variables `s1` and `s2`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
