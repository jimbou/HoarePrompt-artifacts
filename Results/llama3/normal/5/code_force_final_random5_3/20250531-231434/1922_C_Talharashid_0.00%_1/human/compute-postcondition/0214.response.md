Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 2`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is `start + 1` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is the integer value of `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, `start` is not equal to `end`, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is increased by 1 if the previous `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mini` has been reset to 11111111. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
