Output State: **`start` is the last index of `lst`, `end` is less than the last index of `lst`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111, and all other variables (t, i, d2, n, lst, m) remain unchanged. The current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` index and the next index in the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
