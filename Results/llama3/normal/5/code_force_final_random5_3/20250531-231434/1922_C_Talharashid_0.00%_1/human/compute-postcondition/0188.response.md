Output: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is 1, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s + len(lst) - 1, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs with keys from 0 to len(lst) - 1 and values s + len(lst) - 1, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is an integer, inc is -1, start is an integer, s is 0, m is an integer input from the user, start is the integer value from the input minus 1, end is the integer value from the input minus 1. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed**
