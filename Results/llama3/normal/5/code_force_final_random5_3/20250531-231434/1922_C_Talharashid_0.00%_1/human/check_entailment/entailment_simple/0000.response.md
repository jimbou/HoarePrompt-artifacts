Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another city. The program first calculates the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list of cities, and then uses this information to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between any two cities. The program handles the case where the start city is less than the end city and the case where the start city is greater than the end city correctly. The program also handles the case where the start city is equal to the end city correctly, although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
