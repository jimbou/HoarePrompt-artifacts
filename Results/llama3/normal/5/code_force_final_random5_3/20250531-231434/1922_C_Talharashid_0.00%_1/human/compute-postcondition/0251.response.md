Output State: **`start` is the last index of `lst` minus 1, `end` is greater than or equal to the last index of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` if the current value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Otherwise, `s` is 1, `d2[start]` is the value of `s`, and all other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, `m`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value (11111111) and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. The value of `s` is updated based on the new value of `mini`. If the new value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s`. Otherwise, `s` is 1. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
