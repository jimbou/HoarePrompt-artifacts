Output State: **`start` is the last index of `lst` minus 2, `end` is not equal to the last index of `lst` minus 2, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111 if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` if the current value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 1, `d2[start]` is the value of `s` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `d2[start]` is the value of the previous `s`, `d2[start + 1]` is the value of `s` if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `d2[start + 1]` remains unchanged, and all other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, `m`) remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111 if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111. The value of `s` has also been updated based on the new value of `mini`. The values of `d2[start]` and `d2[start + 1]` have been updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
