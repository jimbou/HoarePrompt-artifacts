According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end. If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is not 0 and end is 0. start being not 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to start is not 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s + 1 or s + 2 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s or s + 1. d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key start + inc and value s + 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key start + inc and value s. n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is 0, inc is -1, and start is not 0. If start is 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1]. start is now start + inc, and d2[start] is now s.**
