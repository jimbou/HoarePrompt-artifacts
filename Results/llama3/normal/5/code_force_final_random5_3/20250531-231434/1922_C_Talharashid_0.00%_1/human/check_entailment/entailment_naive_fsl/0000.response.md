Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It first calculates the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next city in both forward and backward directions. Then, for each query, it calculates the minimum cost to travel from the start city to the end city by considering both the forward and backward paths.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including when the start city is the same as the end city, when the start city is the first city, and when the end city is the last city. It also correctly handles the case when the closest city to a given city is the next city in the list.

The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next city in the forward and backward directions, respectively. This allows it to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query.

The program also correctly handles the case when the start city is greater than the end city by swapping the start and end cities and using the backward path.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
