Output State: **`start` is the last index of `lst` minus 1, `end` is greater than or equal to the last index of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1. If `start` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111, and `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 1. If `start` is not 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, and 11111111. `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` if the current value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 1. `d2[start]` is the value of `s`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, `m`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` to its previous value. The values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, `mini`, and `d2[start]` remain the same as before. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, and `m` are unchanged.
