Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, start is equal to the last index of lst, end is 0, inc is -1, s is 0, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise mini is 11111111.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s or s + 1, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key start + inc and value s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is 0, inc is -1, start is start + inc.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s + 1 or s + 2 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s or s + 1. d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key start + inc and value s + 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key start + inc and value s. n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is 0, inc is -1, and start is not 0. If start is 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1]. start is now start + inc, and d2[start] is now s.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values `s + 2` or `s + 3` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values `s + 1` or `s + 2`. `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + 2` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + 1`. `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `start` is now `start + inc`. `d2[start]` is now `s`. `mini` is now the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
