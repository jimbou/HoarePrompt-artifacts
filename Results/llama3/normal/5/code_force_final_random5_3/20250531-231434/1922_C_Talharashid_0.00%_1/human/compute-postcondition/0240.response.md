Postcondition: ***`start` is the last index of `lst`, `end` is less than the last index of `lst`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. All other variables (t, i, d2, n, lst, m) remain unchanged. The current value of `start` is greater than 0.***
