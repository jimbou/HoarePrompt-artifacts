Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to `end` and values `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the last two elements of `lst` and the previous value of `mini` if `start` plus 1 is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111 if `start` is greater than 0, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `mini` is updated only if `start` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains the same.
