Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `start` is 0, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. The current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
