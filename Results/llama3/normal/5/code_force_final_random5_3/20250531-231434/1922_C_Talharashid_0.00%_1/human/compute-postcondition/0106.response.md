Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than `m` + 1, `i` is `m` + 1, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `end` is greater than 0. If the length of `lst` is more than 1, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`, `s` is 0, and the current value of `start` is greater than -1. Otherwise, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is 0, and the current value of `start` is greater than -1.***
