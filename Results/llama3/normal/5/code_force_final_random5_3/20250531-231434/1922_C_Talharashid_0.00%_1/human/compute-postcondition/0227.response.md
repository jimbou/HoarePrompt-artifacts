Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 2`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is `start + 1` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is the integer value of `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, `start` must not be equal to `end`. If `start` is greater than 0, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`, but only if `start` is greater than 0. If `start` is not greater than 0, then `mini` remains unchanged. All other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
