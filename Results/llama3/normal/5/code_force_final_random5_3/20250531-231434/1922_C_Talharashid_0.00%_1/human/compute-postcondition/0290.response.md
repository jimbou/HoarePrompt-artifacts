Output State: **start is an integer, end is an integer, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than 2, i is 2, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to end and start, s2 is not defined because d1 is not defined.**

Explanation:
The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign values to new variables s1 and s2. The first line calculates the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to end and start, and assigns it to s1. The second line attempts to calculate the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to start and end, but it references a variable d1 which is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, s2 is not defined.

The initial state variables start, end, inc, s, d2, m, and i are not modified by the code snippet, so their values remain the same. The only new information added to the output state is the value of s1, which is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to end and start.
