To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `m` to be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst` up to index `i`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
