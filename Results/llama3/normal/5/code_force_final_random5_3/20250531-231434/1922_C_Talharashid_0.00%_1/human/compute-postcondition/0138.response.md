Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to `end` and values `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `start` is equal to the last index of `lst`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is 11111111**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111, while all other variables remain unchanged. The initial state's conditions and values for `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, and `s` are still valid.
