Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has a new key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `end` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than -1 and is equal to its original value plus 1 and `start` must be less than `end`, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` has been reset to 11111111, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the variables, such as `t` being greater than `m + 1`, `start` being less than `end`, and `lst` having at least 2 elements, are still valid.
