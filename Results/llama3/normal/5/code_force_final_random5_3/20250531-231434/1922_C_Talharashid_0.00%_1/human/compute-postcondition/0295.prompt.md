Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains four inputs: first a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The list of integers are non-negative integers, the integer is a positive integer, and the pairs of integers are positive integers less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    start = 0
    end = len(lst) - 1
    inc = 1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d1[start] = s
    start = len(lst) - 1
    end = 0
    inc = -1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d2[start] = s
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        start, end = map(int, input().split())
        start -= 1
        end -= 1
        s = 0
        if start < end:
            s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
            s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
        else:
            s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
            s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
        print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is equal to m, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is -1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, stdin contains no input, start is an integer equal to the first input minus 1, end is an integer equal to the second input minus 1. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst from start to end, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at start and the value of d2 at end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at key end and the value of d2 at key start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at key start and the value of d1 at key end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s + len(lst) - 1, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs with keys from 0 to len(lst) - 1 and values s + len(lst) - 1, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is an integer, inc is -1, start is an integer, s is 0, m is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, start is the integer value from the input minus 1, end is the integer value from the input minus 1. If start is less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: start and end are integers decremented by 1, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than or equal to 0, i is m, stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end]. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to end and start, s2 is not defined because d1 is not defined, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
