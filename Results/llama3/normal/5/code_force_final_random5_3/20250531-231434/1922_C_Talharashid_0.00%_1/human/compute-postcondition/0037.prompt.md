Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers, start is 0, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, s is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and an additional key-value pair where the key is start + inc and the value is s, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the original start value plus inc.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and an additional key-value pair where the key is `start` + `inc` and the value is `s` plus either 1 or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, and another key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the original start value plus 3 times inc. If `start` - 1 is greater than -1 and `start` is less than the length of lst, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the original mini. If `start` - 1 is greater than -1 but `start` is not less than the length of lst, mini remains the original mini. If `start` - 1 is not greater than -1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If mini equals the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, s is increased by 1. Otherwise, s is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and an additional key-value pair where the key is start + inc and the value is s plus either 1 or the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], and another key-value pair where the key is start and the value is s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise the value is s, and an additional key-value pair where the key is start + inc and the value is s, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the original start value plus 4 times inc and start must be less than the length of lst minus 1. If start + 1 is less than the length of lst, then mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111. If start is greater than 0, then mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the original mini. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc].


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
