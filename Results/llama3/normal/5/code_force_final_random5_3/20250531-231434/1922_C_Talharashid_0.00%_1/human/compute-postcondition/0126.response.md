Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has a new key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + 1` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s`. `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `end` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value plus 1 and `start` must be less than `end`, `start` must be less than `end`, `mini` is 11111111.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and conditions as specified in the initial state.
