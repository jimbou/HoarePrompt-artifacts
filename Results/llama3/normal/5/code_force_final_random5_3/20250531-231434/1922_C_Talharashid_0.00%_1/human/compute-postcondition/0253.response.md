Output State: **`start` is the last index of `lst` minus 1, `end` is greater than or equal to the last index of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, and 11111111. `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` if the current value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Otherwise, `s` is 1. `d2[start]` is the value of `s`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, `m`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value, the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element in the list, and a large number (11111111). The value of `s` has been updated based on the new value of `mini`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
