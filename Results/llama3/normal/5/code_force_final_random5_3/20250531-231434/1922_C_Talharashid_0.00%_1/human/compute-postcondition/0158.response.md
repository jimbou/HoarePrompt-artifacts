Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to `end` and values `s` or `s + 1`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is not 0, and `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. If `start` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is still dependent on the value of `start`. If `start` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.
