Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 2`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is `start + 1` and the value is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is the integer value of `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, `start` is not equal to `end`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous `mini`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. The dictionary `d1` has also been updated with a new key-value pair where the key is `start + 1` and the value is the updated `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
