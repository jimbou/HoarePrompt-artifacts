Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is -1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, m must be greater than 2, stdin contains no input, start is an integer equal to the first input minus 1, end is an integer equal to the second input minus 1, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at key end and the value of d2 at key start, s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at key start and the value of d1 at key end.**

The code snippet calculates two new variables, s1 and s2, based on the values stored in dictionaries d2 and d1, respectively. The values of s1 and s2 are the absolute differences between the values at specific keys in these dictionaries. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
