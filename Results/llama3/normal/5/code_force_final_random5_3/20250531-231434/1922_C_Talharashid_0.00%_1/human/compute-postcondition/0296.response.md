Functionality: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four inputs: a positive integer, a list of unique integers in ascending order, another positive integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. The function calculates the cumulative sums of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list in both forward and backward directions, and then uses these sums to calculate the minimum distance between each pair of indices in the list. The function prints the minimum distance for each pair of indices.
