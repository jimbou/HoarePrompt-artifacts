Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of `lst` and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `start` is less than `end`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start` + `inc` in `lst` and 11111111, `s` is 1 if the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start` + `inc` in `lst` is equal to `mini`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start` + `inc` in `lst` and the previous value of `s`. If `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, the values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `inc`, `start`, `mini`, and `s` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `start` - 1 is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start` + `inc` in `lst` and the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start` - 1 in `lst` and 11111111.***
