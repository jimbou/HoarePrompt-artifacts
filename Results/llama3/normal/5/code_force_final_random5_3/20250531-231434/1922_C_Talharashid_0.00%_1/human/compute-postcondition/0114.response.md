Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has a new key-value pair with key start + inc and value s, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is 1, end is greater than 0, start is greater than -1 and is equal to its original value plus 1, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] or lst[start + inc] and lst[start + inc + 1], s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and 0.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc`, which is 1, so `start` is now one more than its original value. It then assigns the value of `s` to the key `start` in dictionary `d1`. The value of `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and 0. The minimum value `mini` is updated to be the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` or `lst[start + inc]` and `lst[start + inc + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
