Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst` up to index `i`, and `m` is an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: start is an integer minus one, end is an integer minus one, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end]. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index end and the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index start, s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index start and the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: start and end are integers, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end]. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences up to end and start indices in d2, s2 is undefined because d1 is not defined in the initial state, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: start and end are integers decremented by 1, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end]. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to end and start, s2 is not defined because d1 is not defined, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
