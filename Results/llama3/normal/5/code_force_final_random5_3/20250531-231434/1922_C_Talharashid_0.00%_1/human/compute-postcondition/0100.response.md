Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, stdin contains no input, start is 0, end is an integer equal to the length of lst minus 1.**

The code snippet provided resets the dictionaries `d1` and `d2`, sets `n` to an integer value from the input, creates a list `lst` from the input, and initializes `start` and `end` to the first and last indices of `lst`, respectively. It also sets `inc` to 1 and `s` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `mini`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
