Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then another integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is a positive integer, the list of integers are non-negative integers, the second integer is a positive integer, and the pairs of integers are positive integers less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.**
