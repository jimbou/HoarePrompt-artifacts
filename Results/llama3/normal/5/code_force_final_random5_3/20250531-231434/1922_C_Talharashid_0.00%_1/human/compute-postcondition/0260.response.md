Output State: **`start` is the last index of `lst` minus 2, `end` is not equal to the last index of `lst` minus 2, `inc` is -1, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` if the current value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 1, `d2[start]` is the value of `s` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `d2[start]` is the value of the previous `s`, `d2[start + 1]` is the value of `s`, and all other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, `m`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `mini` has been reset to 11111111, and the values of `s` and `d2[start]` have been updated based on the new value of `mini`. The values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
