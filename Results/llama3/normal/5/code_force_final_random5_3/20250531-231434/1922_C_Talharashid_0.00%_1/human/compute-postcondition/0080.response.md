Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, m must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at index end and the value of d2 at index start, s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at index start and the value of d1 at index end.**

The code snippet assigns the absolute difference between the values of `d2` at indices `end` and `start` to `s1`, and the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at indices `start` and `end` to `s2`. No other variables are affected. The values of `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the existing values of `d1` and `d2`, which are dictionaries with default values and key-value pairs as described in the initial state. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
