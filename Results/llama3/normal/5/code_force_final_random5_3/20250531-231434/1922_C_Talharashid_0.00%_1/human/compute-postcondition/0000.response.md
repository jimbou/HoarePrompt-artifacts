Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains four inputs: first a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The list of integers are non-negative integers, the integer is a positive integer, and the pairs of integers are positive integers less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, because one test case has been read and its first input (an integer) has been assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs in each test case are still in the stdin, waiting to be read.
