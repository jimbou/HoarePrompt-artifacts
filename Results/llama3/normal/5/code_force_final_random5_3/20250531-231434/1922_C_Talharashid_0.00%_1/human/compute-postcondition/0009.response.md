Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element of `lst` and the previous value of `mini`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, `start` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element of `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2. The value of `start` is still greater than 0.
