Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to `end` and values `s` or `s + 1`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `start` is not 0. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.***
