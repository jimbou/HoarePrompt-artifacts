Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is less than end and equal to start + inc, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and 11111111, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been incremented by `inc`, which is -1, so `start` is now one position to the left in the list `lst`. The value of `d2[start]` has been updated to `s`, which is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start` + `inc` in `lst` and the previous value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
