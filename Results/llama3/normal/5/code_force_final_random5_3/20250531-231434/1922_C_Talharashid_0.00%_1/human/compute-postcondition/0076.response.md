Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, m must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input.**

The code block has modified the values of `start`, `end`, and `s`. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `start` and `end`, but since stdin contains no input, this line does not affect the state. The second and third lines decrement `start` and `end` by 1, respectively. The fourth line resets `s` to 0. No other variables are affected.
