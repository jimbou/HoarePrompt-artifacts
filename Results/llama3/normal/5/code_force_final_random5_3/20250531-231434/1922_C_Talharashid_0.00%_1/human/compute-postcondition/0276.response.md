Output State: **start is an integer minus one, end is an integer minus one, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains no input, s1 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index end and the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index start, s2 is the absolute difference between the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index start and the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index end, and start is not less than end.**

In this output state, the values of `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the differences between the elements of `d2` and `d1` at indices `end` and `start`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
