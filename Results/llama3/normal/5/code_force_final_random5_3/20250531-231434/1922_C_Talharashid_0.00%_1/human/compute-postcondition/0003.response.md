To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of `start` and `end` since they are the variables in the loop head.

Initially, `start` is 0 and `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1. For the loop to execute at least once, `start` and `end` must not be equal. This means `end` must be greater than 0, because if `end` is 0, it would be equal to `start` and the loop would not execute.

Since `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, for `end` to be greater than 0, `lst` must have at least 2 elements.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, start is 0, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, s is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**
