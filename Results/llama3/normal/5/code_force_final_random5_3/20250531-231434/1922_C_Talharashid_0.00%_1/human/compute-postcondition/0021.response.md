Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and an additional key-value pair where the key is `start` + `inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `start` is the original start value plus 2 times `inc`. If `start` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the original `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the original `mini`.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the original `mini`, but only if `start` is less than the length of `lst`. If `start` is not less than the length of `lst`, the value of `mini` remains the same as before. All other variables remain unchanged.
