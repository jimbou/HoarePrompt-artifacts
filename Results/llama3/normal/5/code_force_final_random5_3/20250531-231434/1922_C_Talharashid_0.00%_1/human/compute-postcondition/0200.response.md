Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 2`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is the integer value of `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is 0, `s` is 0, `m` is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, `mini` is 11111111.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `mini` which is assigned the value 11111111. All other variables remain unchanged.
