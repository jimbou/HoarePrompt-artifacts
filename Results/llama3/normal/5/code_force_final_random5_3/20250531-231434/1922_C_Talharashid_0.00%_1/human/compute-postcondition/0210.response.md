Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 2`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is the integer value of `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0. If `start` is greater than 0, then `start` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `start` remains 0. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of `s` has been increased by the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start + inc` in the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
