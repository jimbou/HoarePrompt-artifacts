Output State: **start is an integer, end is an integer, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than 1, i is 1, s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end], stdin contains no input**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between elements in two lists, `d1` and `d2`, at specific indices (`start` and `end`) and assigns these differences to `s1` and `s2`, respectively. The values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `d2`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The input from `stdin` is not used in this code snippet, so it remains empty.
