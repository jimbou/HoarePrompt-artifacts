Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than m + 2, i is m + 1, d1 is an empty dictionary, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers, end is the integer value of len(lst) - 1, inc is 1, start is 0, s is 0, m is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than m + 2, i is m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is start + 1 and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers with length greater than 1, end is the integer value of len(lst) - 1, inc is 1, m is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, start is start + 1, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise mini is 11111111, s is increased by 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc].
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer greater than m + 2, i is m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is start + 1 and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers with length greater than 1, end is the integer value of len(lst) - 1, inc is 1, m is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, start is not equal to end and is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than m + 2, i is m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is start + 1 and the value is s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] if mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1], otherwise the value is s + 1, and another key-value pair where the key is start + 1 + inc and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers with length greater than 1, end is the integer value of len(lst) - 1, inc is 1, m is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, start is not equal to end and is greater than its original value by inc, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini if start is greater than 0, otherwise it is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111 if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise it remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
