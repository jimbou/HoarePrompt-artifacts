Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than `m` + 1, `i` is `m` + 1, `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to `end` and values `s` + `len(lst)` - 1, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs with keys from 0 to `len(lst)` - 1 and values `s` + `len(lst)` - 1, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is `end`, `s` is `s` + `len(lst)` - 1, and `m` is an integer input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is 0, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s + len(lst) - 1, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs with keys from 0 to len(lst) - 1 and values s + len(lst) - 1, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is an integer, inc is -1, start is an integer, s is 0, m is an integer input from the user. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is 1, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s + len(lst) - 1, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs with keys from 0 to len(lst) - 1 and values s + len(lst) - 1, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is an integer, inc is -1, start is an integer, s is 0, m is an integer input from the user, start is the integer value from the input minus 1, end is the integer value from the input minus 1. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is 2, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s + len(lst) - 1, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs with keys from 0 to len(lst) - 1 and values s + len(lst) - 1, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is an integer, inc is -1, start is an integer, s is 0, m is an integer input from the user and greater than 2, start is the integer value from the input minus 1, end is the integer value from the input minus 1. If start is less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
