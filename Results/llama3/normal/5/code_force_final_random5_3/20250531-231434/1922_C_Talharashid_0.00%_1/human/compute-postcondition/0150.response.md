Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s or s + 1, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and a key-value pair with key start + inc and value s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is 0, inc is -1, start is start + inc.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc`, which is -1, effectively decreasing `start` by 1. Then, it assigns the value of `s` to the key `start` in dictionary `d2`. The value of `s` is determined by the initial state, where `s` is 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in `lst`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
