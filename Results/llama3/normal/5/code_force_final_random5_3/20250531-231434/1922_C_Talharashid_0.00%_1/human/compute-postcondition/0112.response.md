Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m` + 1, `i` is `m` + 1, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `end` is greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and 0, `start` is either greater than -1 or -1, if `start` is greater than -1, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, otherwise, `start` is -1 and `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `start` and `mini` are still valid, and `mini` is still not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.
