Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has a new key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `end` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than -1 and is equal to its original value plus 1 and `start` must be less than `end`. If `start` is greater than 0, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111, and `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and 0. If `start` is 0, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111, and `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
