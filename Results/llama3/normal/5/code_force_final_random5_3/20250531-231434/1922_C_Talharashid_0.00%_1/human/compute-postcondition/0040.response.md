Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of `lst` and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `start` is 0, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is 11111111**

The code only assigns a value to the variable `mini`, which is now 11111111. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
