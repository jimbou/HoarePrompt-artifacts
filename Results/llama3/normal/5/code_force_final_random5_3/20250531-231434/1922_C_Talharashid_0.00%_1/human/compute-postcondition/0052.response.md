Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pair where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is the previous value of start plus inc, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the previous value of mini if start is greater than 0, otherwise mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and 11111111, s is 1 if the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst is equal to mini, otherwise s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc`, which is -1, effectively decrementing `start` by 1. Then, it assigns the value of `s` to `d2[start]`, adding a new key-value pair to the dictionary `d2`. The value of `s` is determined based on whether the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in `lst` is equal to `mini`. If they are equal, `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference and the previous value of `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, and `inc` remain unchanged.
