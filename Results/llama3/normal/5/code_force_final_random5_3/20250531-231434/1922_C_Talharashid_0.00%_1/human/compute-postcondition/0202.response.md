Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 2`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is the integer value of `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is 0, `s` is 0, `m` is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the first two elements of the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
