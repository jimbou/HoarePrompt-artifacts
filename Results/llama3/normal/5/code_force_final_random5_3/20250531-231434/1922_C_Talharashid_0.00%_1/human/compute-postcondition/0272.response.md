Output State: **start is an integer minus one, end is an integer minus one, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains no input**

The code first assigns the integer values of the input to `start` and `end`. Since stdin contains a space-separated list of two integers, after this line, stdin is empty. The second and third lines decrement `start` and `end` by 1, respectively. The fourth line resets `s` to 0. No other variables are affected.
