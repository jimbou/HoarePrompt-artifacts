The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`start` is an integer minus one, `end` is an integer minus one, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `d2` is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains no input**
