Output State: **`start` is the last index of `lst`, `end` is less than the last index of `lst`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111. All other variables (t, i, d2, n, lst, m) remain unchanged. The current value of `start` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
