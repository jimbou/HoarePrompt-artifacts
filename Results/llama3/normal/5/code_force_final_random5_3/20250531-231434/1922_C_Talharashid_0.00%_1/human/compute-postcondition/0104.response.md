Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m` + 1, `i` is `m` + 1, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`, `s` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is greater than 0, and the current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
