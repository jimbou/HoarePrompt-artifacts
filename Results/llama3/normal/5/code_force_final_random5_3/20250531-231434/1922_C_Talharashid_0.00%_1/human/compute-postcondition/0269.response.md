Output State: **start is 0, end is 0, inc is -1, s is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, and d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `start` will be 0, `end` will be 0, and `inc` will remain -1. The variable `s` will hold the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list `lst`. The list `d2` will be populated such that each element at index `i` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst` up to index `i`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, `m`) remain unchanged.
