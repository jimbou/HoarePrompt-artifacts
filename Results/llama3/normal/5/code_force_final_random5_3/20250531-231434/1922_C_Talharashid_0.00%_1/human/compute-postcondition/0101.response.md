To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `start != end` and adjust the states of `start` and `end` accordingly.

Right before the loop, `start` is 0 and `end` is an integer equal to the length of `lst` minus 1. Since `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute the first time, `start` and `end` must not be equal. Since `start` is 0, we need to ensure that `end` is not 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `end` to be greater than 0.

State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, stdin contains no input, start is 0, end must be greater than 0**
