Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has a new key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `end` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value plus 1 and `start` must be less than `end`, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` if `start - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is increased by the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` index and the next index (`start + inc`) in the list `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` being `m + 1`, `d1` having a new key-value pair with the updated value, `d2` being an empty dictionary, `n` being an integer, `lst` having at least 2 elements, `inc` being 1, `end` being greater than 0, and `start` being greater than 0 and less than `end`. The value of `mini` is still the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the elements at the current `start` index and the next or previous index in the list `lst`, depending on the value of `start`.
