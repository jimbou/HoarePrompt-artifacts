Postcondition: ***`start` is the last index of `lst` minus 1, `end` is greater than or equal to the last index of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` if the current value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Otherwise, `s` is 1. `d2[start]` is the value of `s`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, `m`) remain unchanged.***
