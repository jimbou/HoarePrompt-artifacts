Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is 2, d1 has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to end and values s + len(lst) - 1, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs with keys from 0 to len(lst) - 1 and values s + len(lst) - 1, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is an integer, inc is -1, start is an integer, s is 0, m is an integer input from the user and greater than 2, start is the integer value from the input minus 1, end is the integer value from the input minus 1, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end.**

In this output state, the values of `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the absolute differences between the values of `d1` and `d2` at the `end` and `start` indices. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties.
