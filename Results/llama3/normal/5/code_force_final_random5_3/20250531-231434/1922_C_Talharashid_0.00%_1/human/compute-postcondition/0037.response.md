Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the length of lst minus 1, s is the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the dictionary `d1` contains the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list `lst`, with the keys being the indices of `lst`. The variable `s` also contains the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
