Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 2`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is `start + 1` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is the integer value of `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, `start` must not be equal to `end`, and `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start + 1` in the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
