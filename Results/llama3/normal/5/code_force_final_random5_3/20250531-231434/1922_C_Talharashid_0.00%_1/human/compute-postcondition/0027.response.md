The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is the original start value plus 3 times inc and end is the length of lst minus 1. For the loop to be executed one more time start must be less than the length of lst minus 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and an additional key-value pair where the key is `start` + `inc` and the value is `s` plus either 1 or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, and another key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the original start value plus 3 times inc and start must be less than the length of lst minus 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the original mini.**
