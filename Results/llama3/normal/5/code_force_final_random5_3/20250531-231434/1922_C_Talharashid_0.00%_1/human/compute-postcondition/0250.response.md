Output State: **`start` is the last index of `lst` minus 1, `end` is greater than or equal to the last index of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` if the current value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Otherwise, `s` is 1, `d2[start]` is the value of `s`, and all other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `lst`, `m`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111. The values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, and `d2[start]` remain the same as before, but `s` is now dependent on the new value of `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged.
