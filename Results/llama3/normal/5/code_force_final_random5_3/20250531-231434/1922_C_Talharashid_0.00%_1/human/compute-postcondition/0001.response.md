According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
