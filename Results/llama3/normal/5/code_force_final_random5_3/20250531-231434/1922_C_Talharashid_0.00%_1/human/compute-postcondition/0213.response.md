The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables start and end. If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is start + 1 and end is the integer value of len(lst) - 1. start being start + 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to start is not equal to end. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 2, i is m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is start + 1 and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers with length greater than 1, end is the integer value of len(lst) - 1, inc is 1, m is an integer input from the user and greater than or equal to 0, start is not equal to end, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise mini is 11111111, s is increased by 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]**
