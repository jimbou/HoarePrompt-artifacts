Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a dictionary with default value 0 and an additional key-value pair where the key is `start` + `inc` and the value is `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, and another key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `start` is the original start value plus 3 times `inc` and `start` must be less than the length of `lst` minus 1, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, and if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111, otherwise if `start` is greater than 0, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the original `mini`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables keep their original values except for `s`, which is increased by the absolute difference between the elements at the current start index and the next index in the list `lst`. The value of `mini` is also updated based on the new start index and the elements in the list `lst`.
