Output State: **start is an integer, end is an integer, inc is -1, s is 0, d2 is a list where each element at index i is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst up to index i, m is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin contains no input. start and end are decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of start and end are updated by subtracting 1 from their initial values. The other variables, inc, s, d2, m, and i, remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty, as no input is provided.
