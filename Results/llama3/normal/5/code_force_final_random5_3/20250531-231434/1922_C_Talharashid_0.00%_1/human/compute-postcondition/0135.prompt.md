Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is 1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, stdin contains no input, start is 0, end is an integer equal to the length of lst minus 1.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has a new key-value pair with key start + inc and value s, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is 1, end is greater than 0, start is greater than -1 and is equal to its original value plus 1, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] or lst[start + inc] and lst[start + inc + 1], s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has a new key-value pair with key `start + inc` and value `s + 1` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is `s`. `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `inc` is 1, `end` is greater than 0, `start` is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value plus 1 and `start` must be less than `end`. If `start` is greater than 0, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111, and `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is the previous value of `s`. If `start` is 0, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111, and `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is the previous value of `s`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has a new key-value pair with key start + inc and value s + 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise the value is s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), d1 has a new key-value pair with key start and value s, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is 1, end is greater than 0, start is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value plus 2 and start must be less than end, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise mini remains 11111111. If start - 1 is greater than -1, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start - 1 is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the length of lst, otherwise mini remains 11111111, s is increased by 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc].


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
