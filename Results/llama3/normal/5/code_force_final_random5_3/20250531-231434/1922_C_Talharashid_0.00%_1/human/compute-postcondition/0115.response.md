The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is greater than -1 and is equal to its original value plus 1 and end is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, start must be less than end.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than m + 1, i is m + 1, d1 has a new key-value pair with key start + inc and value s, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is 1, end is greater than 0, start is greater than -1 and is equal to its original value plus 1 and start must be less than end, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] or lst[start + inc] and lst[start + inc + 1], s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and 0**
