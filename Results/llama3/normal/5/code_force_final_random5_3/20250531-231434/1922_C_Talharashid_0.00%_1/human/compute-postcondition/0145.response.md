Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than `m + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`, `d1` has key-value pairs with keys from 0 to `end` and values `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with default value 0 and no key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0. If `start` is greater than 0, then the current value of `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the last two elements of `lst` and the previous value of `mini` if `start` plus 1 is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise the current value of `mini` remains 11111111. The current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in `lst`.***
