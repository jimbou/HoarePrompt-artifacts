Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst and the previous value of s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start + inc in lst, otherwise it remains the same, m is an integer, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, m must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst from index start to end and the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst from index 0 to start, s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at index start and the value of d2 at index end. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at index end and the value of d2 at index start, s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at index start and the value of d1 at index end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 1, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, m must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input, start is an integer, end is an integer, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the keys are all the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sums of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with default value 0 and key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has at least 2 elements, inc is -1, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between the element at index start and the element at index start - 1 in lst and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it remains 11111111, s is 0, m must be greater than 2, stdin contains no input, start is an integer equal to the first input minus 1, end is an integer equal to the second input minus 1. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst from start to end, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at start and the value of d2 at end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at key end and the value of d2 at key start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at key start and the value of d1 at key end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
