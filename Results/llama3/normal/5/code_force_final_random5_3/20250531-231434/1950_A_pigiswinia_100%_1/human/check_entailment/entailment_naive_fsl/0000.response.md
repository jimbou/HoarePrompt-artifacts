Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c) and prints the corresponding output. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The program handles all possible cases, including equal digits, and produces the expected output.
