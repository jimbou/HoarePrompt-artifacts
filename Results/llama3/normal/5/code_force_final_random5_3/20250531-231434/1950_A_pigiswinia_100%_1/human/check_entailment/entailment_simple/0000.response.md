Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine whether three given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. The conditions for a stair and a peak are clearly defined in the problem description.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks the conditions for a stair and a peak.

The condition for a stair is `a < b < c`, which is correctly implemented in the program. The condition for a peak is `a < b > c`, which is also correctly implemented.

The program correctly handles the cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak by printing "NONE".

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
