The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three digits from the second line of the standard input, and the standard input contains `t-2` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`, then 'NONE' is printed.**
