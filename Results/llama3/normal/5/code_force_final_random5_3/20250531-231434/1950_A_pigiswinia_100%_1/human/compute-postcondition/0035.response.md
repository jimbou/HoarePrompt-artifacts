Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three digits from the last line of the standard input, and the standard input is empty. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input lines, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values from the last line of the input. The loop has printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each line based on the conditions, and the standard input is now empty. The loop counter `i` is now `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times.
