To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `t` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and the standard input contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
