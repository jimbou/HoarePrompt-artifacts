Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three digits from the second line of the standard input, and the standard input contains `t-3` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`, then 'NONE' is printed. Additionally, if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
