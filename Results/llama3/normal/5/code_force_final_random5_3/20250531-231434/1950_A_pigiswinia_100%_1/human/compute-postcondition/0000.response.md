The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**
