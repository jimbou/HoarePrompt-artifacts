Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three digits from the second line of the standard input, and the standard input contains `t-3` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`, then 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `t` and `i` remain the same, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the three digits from the second line of the standard input. The standard input now contains `t-3` lines, each containing three digits. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are still the same, based on the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
