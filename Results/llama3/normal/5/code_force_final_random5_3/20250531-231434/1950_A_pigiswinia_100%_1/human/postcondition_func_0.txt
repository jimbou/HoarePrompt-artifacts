This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains three digits. It then classifies each set of three digits as either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on their relative values and prints the classification. The function processes a specified number of lines (between 1 and 1000), and after processing all lines, the standard input is empty.
