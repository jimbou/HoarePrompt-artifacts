Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining whether three given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.
2. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks the conditions for a stair and a peak.
4. If the condition for a stair (`a < b < c`) is true, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the condition for a peak (`a < b > c`) is true, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither condition is true, it prints "NONE".
7. The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
