Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three digits from the first line of the standard input, and the standard input contains `t-2` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated to the three digits from the first line of the standard input. The standard input now contains `t-2` lines, each containing three digits, since one line has been read. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are still valid, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated.
