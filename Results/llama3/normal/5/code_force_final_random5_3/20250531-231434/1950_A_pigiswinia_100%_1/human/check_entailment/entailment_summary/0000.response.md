Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to classify a set of three digits as either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on their relative values. The program correctly implements the conditions for 'STAIR' (a < b < c) and 'PEAK' (a < b > c) as specified in the problem description. It also handles the 'NONE' case correctly by printing 'NONE' when the digits do not satisfy either of the 'STAIR' or 'PEAK' conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it accurately classifies the input digits according to the problem's requirements. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing the specified number of lines and printing the correct classifications.

Correctness: **True**
