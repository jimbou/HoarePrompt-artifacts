The value of `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is 2, so `w[j]` is the third element of the list `w`. The value of `q[w[2]]` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases. The output state is: `t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[0] is increased by 2 and the value at index w[2] is increased by 1, `j` is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases.
