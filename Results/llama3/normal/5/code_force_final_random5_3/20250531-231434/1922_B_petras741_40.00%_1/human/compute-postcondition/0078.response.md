Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `j` is `n`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is larger than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is `j` if `q[j]` is greater than 0 for all `j` in range(`n+1`).**

In this output state, the value of `res` is calculated based on the value of `rho`, which is `q[eta[0]]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-4` test cases. The buffer and eta lists also remain unchanged.
