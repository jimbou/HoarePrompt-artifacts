Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, eta_ln is at least 3, rho is q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]], res is (rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6) + (q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6) + (q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (rho + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]])), buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index j is j if q[j] is greater than 0 for all j in range(n+1), stdin contains t-7 test cases, j is 3**

The code block modifies the values of `res` and `rho`. The first line increments `res` by the product of `q[eta[j]]`, `q[eta[j]] - 1`, and `q[eta[j]] - 2`, divided by 6. The second line increments `res` by the product of `q[eta[j]]`, `q[eta[j]] - 1`, and `rho`, divided by 2. The third line increments `rho` by `q[eta[j]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
