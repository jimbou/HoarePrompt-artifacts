Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1

    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

# Annotated Program:

    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        
        if n >= 3:
            q = {}
            q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
            for j in range(n):
                q[w[j]] += 1
            eta = []
            for j in range(n + 1):
                if q[j] > 0:
                    eta.append(j)
            eta_ln = len(eta)

            if eta_ln == 1:
                print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
            else:
                res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
                for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                    rho += q[eta[j]]
                    if j > 1000:
                        break
                print(res)
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: t is an integer, stdin contains 0 test cases, buffer is a list, i is t-1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values. If n is at least 3, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is either n or greater than 1000, eta is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, and if eta_ln is 1, the number of ways to choose 3 elements from n elements is printed. Otherwise, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the sum of all values in q, and res is the sum of the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the sum of all values in q up to eta[j-1] for all j in range(1, eta_ln), and if j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and res is printed. If n is less than 3, buffer is an empty list, and 0 is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the given integers, taking into account the frequency of each integer. If n is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the calculated result, which is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from each distinct integer value, plus the number of ways to choose 2 elements from each distinct integer value and 1 element from the remaining integers. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
