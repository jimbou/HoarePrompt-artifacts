Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, eta is a list containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), res is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 all divided by 6, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta_ln is greater than 1, rho is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 plus q[eta[j]], and j is 1, res is increased by q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, and rho is increased by q[eta[j]], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently in. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is altered. The output state reflects this by including all the information from the initial state and adding the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
