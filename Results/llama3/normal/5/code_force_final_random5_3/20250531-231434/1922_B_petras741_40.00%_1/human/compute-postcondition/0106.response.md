Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the value at index `w[3]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `stdin`, and `buffer` remains the same. The value of `q` at index `w[0]` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2, and the value at index `w[3]` is 1. The value of `j` remains the same.
