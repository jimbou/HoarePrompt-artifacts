Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. 

The issue lies in the line `if j > 1000: break`. This line causes the program to stop counting the combinations of sticks that can form a triangle if there are more than 1000 different lengths of sticks. This is not in line with the problem description, which states that the program should calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them, without any restrictions on the number of different lengths of sticks.

For example, if the input is `n = 300000` and `a_i` are all different numbers from 0 to 299999, the program will not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them, because it will stop counting after 1000 different lengths of sticks.
