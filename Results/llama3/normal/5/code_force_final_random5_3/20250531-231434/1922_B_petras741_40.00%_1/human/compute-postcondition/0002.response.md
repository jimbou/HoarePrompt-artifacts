Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is at least 1, there is at least one test case in stdin, and this line consumes one test case, leaving `t-2` test cases in stdin. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `w`. This line consumes another test case from stdin, leaving `t-2` test cases in stdin. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and the buffer remains an empty list.
