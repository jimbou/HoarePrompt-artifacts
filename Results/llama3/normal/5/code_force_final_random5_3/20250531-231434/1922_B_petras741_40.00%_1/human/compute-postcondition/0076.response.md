Output: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index j is j if q[j] is greater than 0 for all j in range(n+1), j is n, the current value of eta_ln is 1, and rho is q[eta[0]], and this is printed: n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 which is the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of n elements**
