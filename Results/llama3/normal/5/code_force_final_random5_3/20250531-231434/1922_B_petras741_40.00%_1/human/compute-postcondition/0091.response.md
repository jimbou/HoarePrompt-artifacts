Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `eta_ln` is at least 3, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[3]]`, `res` is (`rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`) + (`q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6`) + (`q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * (rho + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[3]])`), `buffer` is a list containing 1, `eta` is a list of integers where the value at index 3 is 3 if `q[3]` is greater than 0, and `stdin` contains `t-7` test cases if `j` is less than or equal to 1000, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-8` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
