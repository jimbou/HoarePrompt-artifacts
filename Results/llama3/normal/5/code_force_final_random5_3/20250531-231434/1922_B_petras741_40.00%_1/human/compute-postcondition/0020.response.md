To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(n + 1):`. The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `w`, `eta`, `q`, `stdin`, and `buffer` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise it is an empty list. If `q[j]` > 0, then `eta` also contains 1. `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list.**
