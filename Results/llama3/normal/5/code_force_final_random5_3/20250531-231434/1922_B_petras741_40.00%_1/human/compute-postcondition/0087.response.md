Postcondition: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, eta_ln is at least 3, rho is q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]], res is (rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6) + (q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6) + (q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (rho + q[eta[j]])), buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index j is j if q[j] is greater than 0 for all j in range(n+1), stdin contains t-6 test cases, j is 2. If j is greater than 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains t-7 test cases. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.**
