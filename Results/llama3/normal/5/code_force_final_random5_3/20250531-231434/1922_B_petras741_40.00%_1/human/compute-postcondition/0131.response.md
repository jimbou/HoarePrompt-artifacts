Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-8 test cases, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is greater than 1000, eta is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[1], and res is the value of q at index eta[0] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
