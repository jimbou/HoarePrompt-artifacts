To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `t`, `i`, `w`, `stdin`, `buffer`, and `q`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[0] is increased by 2, `j` is 2**
