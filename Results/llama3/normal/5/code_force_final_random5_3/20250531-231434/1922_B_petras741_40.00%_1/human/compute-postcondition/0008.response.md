Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[0] is increased by 2, j is 1**

In this output state, the value of q at index w[1] is increased by 1 because j is 1 and w[j] is w[1]. The values of the other variables are not affected.
