Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, eta is a list containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is 1, res is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 all divided by 6, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 plus q[eta[j]]**
