You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Otherwise, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the sum of all values in q, and res is the sum of the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the sum of all values in q up to eta[j-1] for all j in range(1, eta_ln), and if j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and res is printed. If n is less than 3, buffer is an empty list, and 0 is being printed.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
