Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, eta is a list containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), res is increased by q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, rho is increased by q[eta[j]], j is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta_ln is greater than 2.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains at least 1, and `i` remains 0. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 3. The list `w` remains unchanged. The list `eta` still contains all indices `j` in the range `n+1` where `q[j]` is greater than 0. The list `q` remains a list of `n+1` integers, but the value at index `w[j]` is increased by 1 for all `j` in the range `n`. The value of `res` is increased by the result of the expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus the result of the expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. The value of `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`. The value of `j` is now 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-2`. The list `buffer` is still empty. The value of `eta_ln` is still greater than 2.
