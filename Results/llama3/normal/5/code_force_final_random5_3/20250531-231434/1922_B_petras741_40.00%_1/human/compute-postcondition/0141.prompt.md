Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is a list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), `j` is n, `eta` is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of eta, `rho` is the value of q at index eta[0], and `res` is the value of q at index eta[0] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2, all divided by 6, and eta_ln is more than 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-7 test cases if j is less than or equal to 1000, otherwise stdin contains t-8 test cases, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is either 2 or greater than 1000, eta is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[1], and res is the value of q at index eta[0] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0], and if j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is either 3 or greater than 1000, eta is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[1] plus the value of q at index eta[j], and res is the value of q at index eta[0] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0], plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by rho. If j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is either 4 or greater than 1001, eta is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3 if j is 4 or at least 1001 if j is greater than 1001, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[1] plus the value of q at index eta[j] plus the value of q at index eta[j], and res is the value of q at index eta[0] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0], plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by rho, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by rho. If j > 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
