Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` in range(n+1) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is increased by 1 for all `j` in range(n), `j` is `n`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, buffer is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: The value of `t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` contains all indices `j` in the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) where the value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at each index `w[j]` has been increased by 1 for all `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is equal to `n`, there are `t-2` test cases in the standard input, and the buffer is empty.
