Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `buffer` is a list containing 1, `eta` is a list containing 0, 1 and 2, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `buffer` remains an empty list and `eta` is a list containing 0 and 1.***
