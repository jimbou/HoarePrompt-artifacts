Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing 0, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list**

The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is 0, the list `eta` now contains the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
