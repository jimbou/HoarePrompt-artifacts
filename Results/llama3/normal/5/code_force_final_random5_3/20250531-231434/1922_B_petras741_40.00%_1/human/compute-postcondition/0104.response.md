The value of `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `w[j]` is an integer from the list `w`, and `j` is 0. Therefore, the value of `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 0**
