Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is n, eta is an empty list**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `eta` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases. The buffer is still an empty list. The list q still contains n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n). The value of j is still n.
