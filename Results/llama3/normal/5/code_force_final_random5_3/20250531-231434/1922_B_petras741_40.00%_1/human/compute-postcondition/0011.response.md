Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is n-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `q` has been updated such that the value at each index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1, where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
