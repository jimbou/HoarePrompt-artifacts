Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `j` is `n`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is larger than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is `j` if `q[j]` is greater than 0 for all `j` in range(`n+1`).
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]], res is (rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6) + (q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6) + (q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho), buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index j is j if q[j] is greater than 0 for all j in range(n+1), stdin contains t-5 test cases. If j is greater than 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains t-6 test cases. Otherwise, j is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, eta_ln is at least 3, rho is q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]], res is (rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6) + (q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6) + (q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (rho + q[eta[j]])), buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index j is j if q[j] is greater than 0 for all j in range(n+1), stdin contains t-6 test cases, j is 2. If j is greater than 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains t-7 test cases. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `eta_ln` is at least 3, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[3]]`, `res` is (`rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`) + (`q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6`) + (`q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * (rho + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[3]])`), `buffer` is a list containing 1, `eta` is a list of integers where the value at index 3 is 3 if `q[3]` is greater than 0, and `stdin` contains `t-7` test cases if `j` is less than or equal to 1000, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-8` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
