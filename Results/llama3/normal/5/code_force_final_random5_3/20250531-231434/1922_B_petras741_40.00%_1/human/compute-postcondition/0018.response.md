Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise it is an empty list and also contains 1, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list**

The code `eta.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the end of the list `eta`. Since `j` is 1, the list `eta` now contains 1 in addition to its previous values. The other variables remain unchanged.
