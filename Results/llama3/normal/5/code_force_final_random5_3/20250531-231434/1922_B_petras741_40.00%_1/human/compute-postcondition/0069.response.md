To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 0, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `buffer` is a list containing 1, `eta` is a list containing 0 and 1, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `buffer` remains an empty list.**
