Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is 0. The current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0***
