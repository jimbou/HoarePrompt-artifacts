Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` in range(`n+1`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is increased by 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is `n`, `res` is the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 all divided by 6, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `eta_ln` is the number of indices `j` in range(`n+1`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `rho` is the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is calculated as the cube of the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0, minus three times the square of the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0, plus two times the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0, all divided by 6. The values of the other variables remain the same.
