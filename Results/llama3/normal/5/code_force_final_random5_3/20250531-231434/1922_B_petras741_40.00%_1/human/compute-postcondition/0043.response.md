Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, eta is a list containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), res is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 all divided by 6, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta_ln is greater than or equal to 2, rho is the sum of the values of q at all indices j in eta, and j is equal to the minimum of eta_ln and 1000.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `res` has been updated to include the contributions from all indices in `eta`, and the value of `rho` has been updated to be the sum of the values of `q` at all indices in `eta`. The value of `j` has been updated to be the minimum of `eta_ln` and 1000, indicating that the loop has executed for all iterations up to `eta_ln` or 1000, whichever is smaller. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
