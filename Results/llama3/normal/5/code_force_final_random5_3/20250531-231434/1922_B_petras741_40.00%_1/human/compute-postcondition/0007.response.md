The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[0] is increased by 1, j is 1**
