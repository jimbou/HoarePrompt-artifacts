Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list.**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was an integer before, it remains an integer, but its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `w`. Since `w` was a list of integers before, it remains a list of integers, but its values are updated to the input values.

The value of `t` is not affected by the code, so it remains at least 2. The value of `i` is also not affected, so it remains 1. The buffer remains an empty list. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2, since two inputs are read, so it becomes `t-4`.
