Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is n-1**

In this output state, a new variable `eta` has been introduced and is assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, and the buffer remains empty. The list `q` still has its values increased by 1 at the indices specified by the list `w`. The variable `j` remains at n-1.
