Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 0, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `buffer` is an empty list, `eta` is a list containing `j` which is 0, `j` is 0, and `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range(`n`). The current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 2, `i` is still 1, `n` is still at least 0, and `w` is still a list of integers equal to the input values. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-4`. The `buffer` is still an empty list. The `eta` list now contains the value of `j`, which is 0. The value of `j` is still 0. The `q` list remains a list of `n+1` integers, where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range(`n`), and the current value of `q[j]` is still greater than 0.
