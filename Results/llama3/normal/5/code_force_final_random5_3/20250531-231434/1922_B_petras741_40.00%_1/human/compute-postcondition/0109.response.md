Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `q` now contains the frequency of each element in the list `w`, where the index of each element in `q` corresponds to the value of the element in `w`. The variable `j` has reached the end of the loop, with a value equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
