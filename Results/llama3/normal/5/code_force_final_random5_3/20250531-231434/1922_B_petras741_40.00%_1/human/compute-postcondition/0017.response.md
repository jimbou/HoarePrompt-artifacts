The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise it is an empty list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list**
