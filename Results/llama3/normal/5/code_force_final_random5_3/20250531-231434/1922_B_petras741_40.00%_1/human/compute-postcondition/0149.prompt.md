Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. buffer is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list eta is created containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is n. If eta_ln equals 1, the number of 3-combinations of n elements, which is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6, is being printed and rho is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0. Otherwise, res is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 all divided by 6, rho is the sum of the values of q at all indices j in eta, and j is equal to the minimum of eta_ln and 1000, and the value of res is being printed. If n is less than 3, 0 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is a list. If n is at least 3, buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index j is j if q[j] is greater than 0 for all j in range(n+1), j is n, rho is q[eta[0]], and if eta_ln is 1, the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed, otherwise, the result of the expression res is being printed, which is a combination of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the sets of q[eta[1]], q[eta[2]], ..., q[eta[1000]] and the sum of the products of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from the sets of q[eta[1]], q[eta[2]], ..., q[eta[1000]] and the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the sets of q[eta[0]], q[eta[1]], ..., q[eta[1000]]. If n is less than 3, buffer is an empty list, and 0 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-6 test cases. If n is at least 3, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is either n or greater than 1000, eta is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, and if eta_ln is 1, the number of ways to choose 3 elements from n elements is printed. Otherwise, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the sum of all values in q, and res is the sum of the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the sum of all values in q up to eta[j-1] for all j in range(1, eta_ln), and if j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and res is printed. If n is less than 3, buffer is an empty list, and 0 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
