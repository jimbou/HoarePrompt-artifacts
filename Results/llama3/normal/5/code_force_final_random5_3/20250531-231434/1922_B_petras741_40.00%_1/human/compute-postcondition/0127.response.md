Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is a list, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), `j` is n, `eta` is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of eta, `rho` is the value of q at index eta[0], and `res` is the value of q at index eta[0] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2, all divided by 6, and eta_ln is more than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `res`, which is calculated based on the value of `q` at index `eta[0]`. The value of `res` is the result of multiplying the value of `q` at index `eta[0]` by itself minus 1, and then by itself minus 2, and finally dividing by 6. The other variables remain unchanged.
