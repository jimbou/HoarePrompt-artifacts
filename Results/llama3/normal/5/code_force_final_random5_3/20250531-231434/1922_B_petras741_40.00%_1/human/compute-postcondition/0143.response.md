Output: **t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is either eta_ln or greater than 1000, eta is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the sum of all values in q, and res is the sum of the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the sum of all values in q up to eta[j-1] for all j in range(1, eta_ln), and if j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and res is printed**
