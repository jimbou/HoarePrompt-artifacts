Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is n, eta is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n + 1):
    if q[j] > 0:
        eta.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 0, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is 0, and `eta` is a list containing the value 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is 3, and `eta` is a list containing the value 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` also contains the value 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is 4. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` is a list containing the values 0, 3, and 4. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
