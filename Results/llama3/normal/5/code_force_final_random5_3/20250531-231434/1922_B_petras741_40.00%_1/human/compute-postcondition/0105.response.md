To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `t`, `w`, `stdin`, `buffer`, and `q`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 3**
