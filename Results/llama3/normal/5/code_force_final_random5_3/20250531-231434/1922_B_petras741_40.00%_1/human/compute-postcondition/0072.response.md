Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index j is j if q[j] is greater than 0 for all j in range(n+1), j is n.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, and `stdin` as the initial state. The `buffer` will contain the value 1. The `eta` list will contain all the indices `j` from the `q` list where the value of `q[j]` is greater than 0. The value of `j` will be equal to `n`.
