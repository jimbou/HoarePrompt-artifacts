The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a mathematical formula for calculating the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time.

In this context, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, which means it represents the number of elements in the list `w`.

So, the output will be the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, which is a specific numerical value.

Output: **n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 (where n is the input value)**
