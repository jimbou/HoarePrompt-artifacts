The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and is at least 3, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the value at index `w[2]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 3**
