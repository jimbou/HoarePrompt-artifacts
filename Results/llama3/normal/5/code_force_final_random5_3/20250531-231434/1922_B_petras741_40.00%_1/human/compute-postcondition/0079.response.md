To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `eta_ln`. The loop will execute if `eta_ln` is at least 2, because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `eta_ln-1`. Since `eta_ln` is already larger than 1, we just need to make sure that `j` is 1, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `j` is 1, `eta_ln` is at least 2, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index `j` is `j` if `q[j]` is greater than 0 for all `j` in range(`n+1`)**
