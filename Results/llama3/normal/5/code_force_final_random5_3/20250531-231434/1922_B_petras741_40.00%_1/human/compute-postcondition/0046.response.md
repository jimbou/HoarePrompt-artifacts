Postcondition: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, eta is a list containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is n, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list. If eta_ln equals 1, the number of 3-combinations of n elements, which is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6, is being printed and rho is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0. Otherwise, res is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 all divided by 6, rho is the sum of the values of q at all indices j in eta, and j is equal to the minimum of eta_ln and 1000, and the value of res is being printed.**
