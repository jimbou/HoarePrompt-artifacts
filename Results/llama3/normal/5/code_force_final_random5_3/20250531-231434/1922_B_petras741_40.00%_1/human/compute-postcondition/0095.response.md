Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index j is j if q[j] is greater than 0 for all j in range(n+1), j is n, rho is q[eta[0]], and if eta_ln is 1, the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed, otherwise, the result of the expression res is being printed, which is a combination of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the sets of q[eta[1]], q[eta[2]], ..., q[eta[1000]] and the sum of the products of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from the sets of q[eta[1]], q[eta[2]], ..., q[eta[1000]] and the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the sets of q[eta[0]], q[eta[1]], ..., q[eta[1000]].***
