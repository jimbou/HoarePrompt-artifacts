Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `buffer` is a list containing 1, `eta` is a list containing 0, 1 and 2, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `buffer` remains an empty list and `eta` is a list containing 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the value of `j`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `buffer` and `eta` still depends on the value of `q[j]`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `buffer` contains 1 and `eta` contains 0, 1, and 2. Otherwise, `buffer` is empty and `eta` contains 0 and 1.
