Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and is at least 2, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `buffer` is an empty list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the value at index `w[2]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[2]]` has been incremented by 1, so the value at index `w[2]` in the list `q` is now 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
