Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is either 4 or greater than 1001, eta is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3 if j is 4 or at least 1001 if j is greater than 1001, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[1] plus the value of q at index eta[j] plus the value of q at index eta[j], and res is the value of q at index eta[0] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0], plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by rho, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by rho. If j > 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
