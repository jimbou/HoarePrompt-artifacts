Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 0, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list. The current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0.**
