Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), j is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list. If `q[j]` > 0, then `eta` is a list containing 0, 1 and 2. Otherwise, `eta` is a list containing 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise it is an empty list.***
