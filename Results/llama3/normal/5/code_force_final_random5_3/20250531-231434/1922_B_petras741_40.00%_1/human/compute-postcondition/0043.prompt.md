Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` in range(`n+1`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is increased by 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is `n`, `res` is the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 all divided by 6, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `eta_ln` is the number of indices `j` in range(`n+1`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `rho` is the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, eta is a list containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), res is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 all divided by 6, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 plus q[eta[j]], and if the current value of j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, eta is a list containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), res is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 all divided by 6, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta_ln is greater than 1, rho is the value of q at the first index where q[j] is greater than 0 plus q[eta[j]], and j is 1, res is increased by q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, and rho is increased by q[eta[j]]. If j is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 1, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, eta is a list containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), res is increased by q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, rho is increased by q[eta[j]], j is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta_ln is greater than 2. If j is greater than 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
