The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and eta_ln, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `eta_ln`. If `j` is less than `eta_ln`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either 3 or greater than 1000, `eta_ln` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 and `eta_ln` must be at least 3 if `j` is 3 or `eta_ln` is at least 1001 if `j` is greater than 1000.
State: **t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range(n), j is either 4 or greater than 1001, eta is a list containing all values j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3 if j is 4 or at least 1001 if j is greater than 1001, rho is the value of q at index eta[0] plus the value of q at index eta[1] plus the value of q at index eta[j], and res is the value of q at index eta[0] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[1] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[1] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[0], plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 2, all divided by 6, plus the value of q at index eta[j] multiplied by the value of q at index eta[j] minus 1, divided by 2, multiplied by rho.**
