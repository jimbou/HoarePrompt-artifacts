Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is 3, and `eta` is a list containing the value 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list and now also contains the value 3.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values except for `eta`. The list `eta` now contains the value 3 in addition to its previous value, which was either an empty list or a list containing the value 0, depending on the value of `q[j]`.
