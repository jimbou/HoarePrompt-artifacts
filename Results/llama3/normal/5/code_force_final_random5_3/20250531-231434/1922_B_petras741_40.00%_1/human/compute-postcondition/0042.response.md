Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, n is greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, eta is a list containing all indices j in range(n+1) where q[j] is greater than 0, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is increased by 1 for all j in range(n), res is increased by q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, rho is increased by q[eta[j]], j is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta_ln is greater than 2. If j is greater than 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
