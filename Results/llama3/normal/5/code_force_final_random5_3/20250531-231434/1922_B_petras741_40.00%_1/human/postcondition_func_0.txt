This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the given integers, taking into account the frequency of each integer. If n is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the calculated result, which is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from each distinct integer value, plus the number of ways to choose 2 elements from each distinct integer value and 1 element from the remaining integers. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
