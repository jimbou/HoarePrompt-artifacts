Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, w is a list of integers equal to the input values, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is a list, q is a list of n+1 zeros. If n is at least 3, buffer is a list containing 1, eta is a list of integers where the value at index j is j if q[j] is greater than 0 for all j in range(n+1), j is n, rho is q[eta[0]], and if eta_ln is 1, the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed, otherwise, the result of the expression res is being printed, which is a combination of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the sets of q[eta[1]], q[eta[2]], ..., q[eta[1000]] and the sum of the products of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from the sets of q[eta[1]], q[eta[2]], ..., q[eta[1000]] and the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the sets of q[eta[0]], q[eta[1]], ..., q[eta[1000]]. If n is less than 3, buffer is an empty list, and 0 is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    q[w[j]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 1, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the value at index `w[3]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 5, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the value at index `w[3]` is 1 and the value at index `w[4]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `j` is 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
