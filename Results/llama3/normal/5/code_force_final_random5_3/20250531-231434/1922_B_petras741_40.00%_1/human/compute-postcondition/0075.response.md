The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a mathematical formula for calculating the number of combinations of 3 items from a set of `n` items.

In this case, `n` is an integer equal to the input value. The exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is known to be an integer.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the formula `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, where `n` is the input value.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the input value)**
