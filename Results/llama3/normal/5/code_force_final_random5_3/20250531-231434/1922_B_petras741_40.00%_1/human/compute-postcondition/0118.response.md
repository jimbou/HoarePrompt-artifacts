The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `w` is a list of integers equal to the input values, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `buffer` is a list, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range(`n`), `j` is 4, and `eta` is a list containing the value 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` also contains the value 3.**
