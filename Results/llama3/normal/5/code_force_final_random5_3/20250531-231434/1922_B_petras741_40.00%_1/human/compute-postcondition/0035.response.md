The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and eta_ln, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `eta_ln`. If `j` is less than `eta_ln`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `eta_ln` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` in range(`n+1`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is increased by 1 for all `j` in range(`n`), `res` is the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 cubed minus three times the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 squared plus two times the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 all divided by 6, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `buffer` is an empty list, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at the first index where `q[j]` is greater than 0 plus `q[eta[j]]`, and if the current value of `j` is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `j` is 1**
