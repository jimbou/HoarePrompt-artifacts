Postcondition: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is 0 if the sum of the two integers in the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar` is less than 0, otherwise `sub_summ` is the sum of the two integers in the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to 0, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`.**
