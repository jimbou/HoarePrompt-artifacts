Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program uses three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` reads an integer from the input, `func_2` reads a list of integers from the input, and `func_3` calculates the maximum profit for Alice.

2. The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1`. Then, for each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob can take for free `k` using `func_2`.

3. The program then reads the prices of the items for Alice and Bob using `func_2`. It combines these prices into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the price for Alice and the price for Bob.

4. The program sorts the list of tuples based on the difference between the price for Bob and the price for Alice. This is done to prioritize the items that will give Alice the maximum profit.

5. The program then calculates the maximum profit for Alice using `func_3`. This function iterates over the sorted list of tuples and calculates the profit for each item. If the profit is non-negative, it adds the profit to the total sum.

6. Finally, the program prints the maximum profit for Alice for each test case.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly reads the input, sorts the items based on their profit, and calculates the maximum profit for Alice.

Correctness: **True**
