Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is the sum of the two integers in the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to the sum of the two integers in the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr` (which is empty), `val_b` is the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `main_ar` remains unchanged with at least 2 pairs of integers. The list `sec_arr` is still empty. The variable `sub_summ` now holds the sum of the two integers in the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to its previous value, which was either 0 or the sum of the two integers in the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. The variable `val_a` is still the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr`, which is empty. The variable `val_b` is still the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`.
