Postcondition: ***`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr` (which is empty), `val_b` is the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. If the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is either 0 or the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to 0 added to the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar`.***
