Let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is: `sub_summ += val_a[0]`

The initial state is:
- `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers
- `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs
- `sub_summ` is `main_ar[0][0]`
- `val_a` is the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`

Now, let's think step by step:

1. `val_a` is the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`, so `val_a[0]` is the first integer of the second pair.
2. `sub_summ` is initially `main_ar[0][0]`, and it is incremented by `val_a[0]`.

Therefore, the new value of `sub_summ` is `main_ar[0][0] + val_a[0]`.

The values of `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are not affected by the code, so they remain the same.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sub_summ` is `main_ar[0][0] + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged, but the value of `sub_summ` is now the sum of the first integer of the first pair in `main_ar` and the first integer of the second pair in `sec_arr`.
