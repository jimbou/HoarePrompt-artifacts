Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Alice's profit and minimize Bob's profit. The function `func_3` calculates the sum of the differences between the prices for Alice and Bob, but it does not consider the condition where Bob takes k items for free.

For example, if the input is:

n = 3, k = 2
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]

The program will calculate the sum of the differences as:

(4-1) + (5-2) + (6-3) = 9

However, Bob can take the first two items for free, so the correct calculation should be:

(5-2) + (6-3) = 6

The program does not handle this case correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
