Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sub_summ` is `main_ar[0][0] + 2*val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`**

In this output state, the value of `sub_summ` has been updated to include an additional `val_a[0]`, which is the first element of the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
