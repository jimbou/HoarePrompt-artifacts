To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least 2 pairs of integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sec_arr` has at least 1 pair of integers, `val_a` is the first pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.

For the loop to execute again, `sec_arr` must have at least 2 pairs of integers, and `val_a` must be the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sub_summ` is `main_ar[0][0]`, `val_a` is the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.**
