Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is the sum of all the first elements of the pairs in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `main_ar` remains unchanged, `sec_arr` becomes empty because all its elements have been iterated over, `sub_summ` accumulates the sum of the first elements of all pairs in the initial `sec_arr`, and `val_a` takes the value of the last pair in the initial `sec_arr`.
