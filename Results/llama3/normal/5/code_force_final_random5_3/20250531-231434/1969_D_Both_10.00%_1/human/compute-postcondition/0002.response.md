The code `sub_summ += val_a[0]` adds the first element of the pair `val_a` to `sub_summ`. Since `val_a` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, we can express `val_a` as `main_ar[0]`. Therefore, the code is equivalent to `sub_summ += main_ar[0][0]`.

The value of `sub_summ` is initially 0, so after the addition, it becomes `main_ar[0][0]`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sub_summ` is `main_ar[0][0]`, `val_a` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`.**
