stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; 0 <= k <= n). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
