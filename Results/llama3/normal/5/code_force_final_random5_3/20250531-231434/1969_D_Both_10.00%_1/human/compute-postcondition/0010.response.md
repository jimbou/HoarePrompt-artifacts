Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is the sum of the two integers in the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to 0, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. The current value of `val_b` is a pair of integers where the sum of the two integers is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `main_ar` still contains at least one pair of integers. The list `sec_arr` is still empty. The variable `sub_summ` now holds the sum of the two integers in the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, added to its initial value of 0. The values of `val_a` and `val_b` remain unchanged.
