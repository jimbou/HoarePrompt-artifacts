Output State: **The program returns the sum of all the first elements of the pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of all pairs of integers in `main_ar` where the sum of the pair is greater than or equal to 0. Since `sec_arr` is an empty list, the sum of its first elements is 0. The sum of all pairs of integers in `main_ar` where the sum of the pair is greater than or equal to 0 is calculated based on the pairs in `main_ar`.**
