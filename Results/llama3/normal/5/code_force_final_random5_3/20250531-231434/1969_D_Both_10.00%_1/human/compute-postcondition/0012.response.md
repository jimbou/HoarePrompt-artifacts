To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for val_b in main_ar:`

The objects involved in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `main_ar` list. If the list has at least one more pair of integers, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `main_ar` has at least 1 pair of integers, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `sub_summ` is either 0 or the sum of the two integers in the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to 0, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr` (which is empty), and `sec_arr` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute again, `main_ar` must have at least one more pair of integers, and `val_b` must be the next pair of integers in the list.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is either 0 or the sum of the two integers in the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to 0, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr` (which is empty), `val_b` is the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`**
