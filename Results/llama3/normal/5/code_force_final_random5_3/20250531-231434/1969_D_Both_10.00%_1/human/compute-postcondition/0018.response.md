Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is the sum of all the first elements of the pairs in the initial `sec_arr` plus the sum of all pairs of integers in `main_ar` where the sum of the pair is greater than or equal to 0, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `main_ar` remains unchanged as a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` remains an empty list, `sub_summ` is the sum of all the first elements of the pairs in the initial `sec_arr` (which is 0 since `sec_arr` is empty) plus the sum of all pairs of integers in `main_ar` where the sum of the pair is greater than or equal to 0, and `val_a` remains the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr` (which is empty).
