Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is the sum of all the first elements of the pairs in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr`.
Code of the loop:
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is 0 if the sum of the two integers in the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar` is less than 0, otherwise `sub_summ` is the sum of the two integers in the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to 0, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr` (which is empty), `val_b` is the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. If the sum of the two integers in the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is the sum of the two integers in the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to the sum of the two integers in the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is either 0 or the sum of the two integers in the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr` (which is empty), `val_b` is the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. If the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is either 0 or the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar` added to 0 added to the sum of the two integers in the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
