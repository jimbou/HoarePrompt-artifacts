Postcondition: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is 0, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. The current value of `val_b` is a pair of integers where the sum of the two integers is greater than or equal to 0.**
