Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game in a shop. The program calculates Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases from standard input using `func_1`. For each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob can take for free `k` using `func_2`. It then reads the prices of the items for Alice and Bob using `func_2`.

The program sorts the items based on their prices for Bob in ascending order. It then calculates the maximum profit Alice can get by considering different scenarios. In the first scenario, Alice buys all items and Bob takes `k` items for free. In the second scenario, Alice buys `n-k` items and Bob takes `k` items for free.

The program uses a heap data structure to efficiently calculate the maximum profit. It pushes the prices of the items that Bob takes for free into the heap and pops the maximum price from the heap when calculating the profit.

The program also uses a temporary list `temp_pop` to store the popped items from the heap. This is done to avoid modifying the original list of items.

The program calculates the maximum profit by iterating over the items and updating the maximum profit if a higher profit is found.

The program prints the maximum profit for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct. It correctly calculates Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Correctness: **True**
