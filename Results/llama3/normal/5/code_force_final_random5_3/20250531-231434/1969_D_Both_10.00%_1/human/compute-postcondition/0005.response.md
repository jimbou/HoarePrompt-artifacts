To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for val_a in sec_arr:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least one more pair of integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sec_arr` has at least 2 pairs of integers, and `val_a` is the second pair of integers in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least 3 pairs of integers, and `val_a` must be the third pair of integers in the list.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sub_summ` is `main_ar[0][0] + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`**
