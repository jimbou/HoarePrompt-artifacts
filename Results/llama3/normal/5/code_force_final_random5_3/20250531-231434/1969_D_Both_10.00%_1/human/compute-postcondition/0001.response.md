According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least 1 pair of integers the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `sub_summ` is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list `sec_arr` must have at least 1 pair of integers and the variable `val_a` is the first pair of integers in the list.
State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sub_summ` is 0, `val_a` is the first pair of integers in the list**
