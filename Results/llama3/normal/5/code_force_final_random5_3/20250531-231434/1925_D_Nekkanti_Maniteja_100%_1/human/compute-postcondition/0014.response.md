Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 3 * `c * i * c * m + 3 * c * a`, `a` is `m * f`, `i` is 2, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, `f` is an integer**

The value of `s` is updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value. Since `i` is 2, the expression `c * i * c * m` simplifies to `2 * c * c * m`. The value of `a` is still `m * f`, and the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read.
