Output State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * 0 * c * m + c * a + c * 1 * c * m + c * a + c * 2 * c * m + c * a + ... + c * (k - 1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is `f * m`, `f` is an integer, `i` is `k`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `s` has been updated to include the sum of the terms `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 0 to `k - 1`. The variable `i` has also been updated to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
