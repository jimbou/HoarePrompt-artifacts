Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, f is an integer, i is k, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated to the integers read from `stdin`. The value of `M` remains the same. The value of `c` has been calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. The value of `s` has been reset to 0, and the value of `a` has also been reset to 0. The values of `f`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` has been updated to reflect that three integers have been read.
