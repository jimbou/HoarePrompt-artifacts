Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains 3 integers n, m and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, f_i. n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, m is an integer between 0 and min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, a_i and b_i are integers between 1 and n, and f_i is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**
