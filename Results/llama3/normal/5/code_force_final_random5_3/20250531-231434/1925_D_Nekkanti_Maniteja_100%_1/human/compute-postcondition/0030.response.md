Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * 0 * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is `f * m`, `f` is an integer, `i` is 1, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value, where `i` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
