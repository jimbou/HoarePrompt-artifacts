Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a`, `a` is `m * f`, `i` is `k - 1`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, `f` is an integer**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `s` has accumulated the sum of `k` iterations of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `k - 1`. The variable `i` has reached its final value of `k - 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
