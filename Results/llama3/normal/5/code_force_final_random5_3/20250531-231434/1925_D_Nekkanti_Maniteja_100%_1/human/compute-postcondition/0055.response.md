Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + k * c * a, a is the sum of all f values, i is k - 1, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases, and the value of s modulo M is being printed, where s is k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + k * c * a and M is 10^9 + 7**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input. The variables n, m, k, M, c, s, a, i, u, and v have the same values as after the third iteration, but stdin no longer contains any test cases. The final value of s, which is the result of the expression k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + k * c * a, is being printed modulo M.
