To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2 modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read**
