The code snippet reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. It then calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M` and assigns it to `c`. The variables `s` and `a` are initialized to 0.

Output State: **n, m, and k are integers, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, i is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read**
