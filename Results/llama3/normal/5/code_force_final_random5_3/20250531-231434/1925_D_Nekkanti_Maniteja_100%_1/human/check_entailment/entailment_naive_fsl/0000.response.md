Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the line where the sum `s` is calculated. The correct formula for the expected value should be `s = s + c * (a + i * m)`, not `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. The correct formula takes into account the increase in friendship value for each pair of friends in each excursion.

A counterexample can be constructed with `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, and `f = 1`. The expected output should be `3`, but the program outputs `2`.
