Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is f + f, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case - 1**

The code block reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f`. The value of `a` is incremented by `f`, resulting in `a` being equal to `f + f`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
