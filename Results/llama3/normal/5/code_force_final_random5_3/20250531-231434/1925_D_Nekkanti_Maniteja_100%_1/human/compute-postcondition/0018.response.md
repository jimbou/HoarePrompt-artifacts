The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the value of the expression `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, and the value of the expression `int(input())` is unknown. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `k`. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a`, `a` is `m * f`, `i` is `k`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, `f` is an integer, and the value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed, where `s` is the result of the expression `k * c * (k - 1 + f) * m`**
