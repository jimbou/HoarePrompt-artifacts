Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is `m * f`, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, `f` is an integer**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `stdin`, and `f` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `s`, which is now calculated as the sum of three terms: `c * i * c * m` (which is 0 since `i` is 0), `c * a` (which is `c * m * f`), and the previous value of `s` (which was 0). Therefore, the new value of `s` is `c * m * f`.
