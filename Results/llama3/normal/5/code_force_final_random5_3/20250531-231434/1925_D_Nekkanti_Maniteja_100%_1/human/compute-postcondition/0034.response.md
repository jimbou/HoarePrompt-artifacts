Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * 0 * c * m + c * a + c * 1 * c * m + c * a + c * 2 * c * m + c * a + ... + c * (k - 1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is `f * m`, `f` is an integer, `i` is `k - 1`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variables `n`, `m`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `f`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `s` is updated to be the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 0 to `k - 1`. The variable `i` is updated to be `k - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times.
