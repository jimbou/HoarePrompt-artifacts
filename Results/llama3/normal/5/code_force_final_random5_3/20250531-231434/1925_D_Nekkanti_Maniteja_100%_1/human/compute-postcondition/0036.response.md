The code prints the value of `s` modulo `M`, where `s` is the sum of terms calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k - 1`, and `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `a` is `f * m`, `f` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, and `M` is 10^9 + 7.
Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * 0 * c * m + c * a + c * 1 * c * m + c * a + c * 2 * c * m + c * a + ... + c * (k - 1) * c * m + c * a`, `a` is `f * m`, `f` is an integer, `i` is `k - 1`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases, and the value of `s` modulo `M` is being printed**
