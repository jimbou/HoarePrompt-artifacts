Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `2 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`, `a` is the sum of all f values, `i` is 1, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case - m**

The code adds `c * i * c * m + c * a` to the value of `s`. Since `s` was initially `c * i * c * m + c * a`, its new value is `2 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
