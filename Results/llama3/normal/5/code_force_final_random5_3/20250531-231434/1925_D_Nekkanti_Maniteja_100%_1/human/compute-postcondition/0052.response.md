Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + k * c * a, a is the sum of all f values, i is k - 1, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case - m**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `s`, `i`, and the constraints on `k`. The value of `s` is now `k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + k * c * a`, which is the sum of the values of `s` after each iteration of the loop. The value of `i` is now `k - 1`, which is the last value of `i` after the loop finishes executing. The constraint on `k` is now `k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0`, which means that the loop can execute zero or more times.
