Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k). It also reads the friendship values for each pair of friends.
2.  The program calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n \* (n - 1) // 2 modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.
3.  The program correctly sums up all the friendship values (f_i) for each pair of friends.
4.  The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions using the formula k \* (k - 1) // 2 \* c \* m + k \* c \* a, where c is the modular multiplicative inverse and a is the sum of f_i values.
5.  Finally, the program prints the value of s modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case, which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Correctness: **True**
