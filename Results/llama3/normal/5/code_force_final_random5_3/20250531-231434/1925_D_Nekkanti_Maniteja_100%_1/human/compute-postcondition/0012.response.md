Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 2 * `c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`, `a` is `m * f`, `i` is 1, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, `f` is an integer**

The value of `s` is updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value, which was `c * i * c * m + c * a`. Since `i` is 1, the new value of `s` is 2 times the previous value of `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
