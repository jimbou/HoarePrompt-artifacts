Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all f values, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case - m**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to be the sum of the product of `c`, `i`, `c`, and `m`, and the product of `c` and `a`. The stdin still contains at least one test case, but the value of `m` has been consumed.
