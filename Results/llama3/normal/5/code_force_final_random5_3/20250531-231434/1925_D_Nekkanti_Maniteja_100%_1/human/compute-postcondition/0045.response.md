Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is the sum of all f values, i is m, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case - m**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `a` will be the sum of all `f` values read from the input, and the value of `i` will be equal to `m`, which is the number of iterations the loop was supposed to execute. The other variables remain unchanged.
