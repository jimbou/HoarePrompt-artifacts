Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, k is an integer, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is 3f, i is 2, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, f is an integer**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, M, c, s, i, and f remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of a is updated to 3f, which is the result of adding f to its original value of 2f. The values of u and v are assigned the integer values read from stdin, and stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read.
