Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i.

2. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

3. It correctly sums up all f_i values, which represent the initial friendship values of each pair of friends.

4. The program then computes the value s based on the formula k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + k * c * a, where c is the modular multiplicative inverse and a is the sum of f_i values. This formula calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

5. Finally, the program prints the value of s modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case, which is the required output.

The program correctly implements the mathematical formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, and it handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
