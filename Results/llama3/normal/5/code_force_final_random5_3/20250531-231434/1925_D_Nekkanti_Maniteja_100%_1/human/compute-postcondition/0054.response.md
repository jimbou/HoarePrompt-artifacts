Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + k * c * a, a is the sum of all f values, i is k - 1, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case - m, and the value of s modulo M is being printed, where s is k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + k * c * a and M is 10^9 + 7**
