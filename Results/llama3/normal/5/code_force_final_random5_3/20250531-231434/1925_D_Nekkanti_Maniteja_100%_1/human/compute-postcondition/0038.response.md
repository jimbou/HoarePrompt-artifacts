Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is 0, i is k, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case.**

The code block first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `M` is set to 10^9 + 7. The modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M` is calculated and assigned to `c`. The variables `s` and `a` are initialized to 0. The value of `i` is set to `k`. The values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Stdin now contains at least one test case.
