Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * 0 * c * m + c * a`, `a` is `f * m`, `f` is an integer, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the terms `c * 0 * c * m` and `c * a`, where `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, and `a` is `f * m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is 0, so the term `c * 0 * c * m` is effectively 0.
