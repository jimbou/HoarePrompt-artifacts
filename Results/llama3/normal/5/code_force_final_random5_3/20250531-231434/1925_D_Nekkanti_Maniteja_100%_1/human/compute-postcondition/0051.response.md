Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `4 * c * i * c * m + 3 * c * a`, `a` is the sum of all f values, `i` is 2, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case - m**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `4 * c * i * c * m + 3 * c * a` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is still 2, so the expression `c * i * c * m` is equivalent to `2 * c * c * m`.
