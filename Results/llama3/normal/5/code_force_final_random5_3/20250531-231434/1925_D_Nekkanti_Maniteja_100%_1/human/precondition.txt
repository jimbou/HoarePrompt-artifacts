t is a positive integer, for each test case, n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer such that m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is a positive integer such that k <= 2*10^5, and for each of the m pairs, a_i and b_i are distinct positive integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and f_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
