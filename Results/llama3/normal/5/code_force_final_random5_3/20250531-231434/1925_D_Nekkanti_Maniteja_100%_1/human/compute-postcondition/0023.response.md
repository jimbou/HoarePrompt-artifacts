Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 1, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is f + f, f is an integer, i is 1, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read.**

The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to u, v, and f. The second line increments a by the value of f. Since a was initially f, it becomes f + f. No other variables are affected.
