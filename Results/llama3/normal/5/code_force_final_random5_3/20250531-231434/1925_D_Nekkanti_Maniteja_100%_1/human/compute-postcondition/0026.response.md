Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, M is 10^9 + 7, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M, s is 0, a is f * m, f is an integer, i is m - 1, u is an integer, v is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, with the variable 'a' accumulating the sum of 'm' values of 'f'. The loop counter 'i' has reached its final value of 'm - 1', and there are no more test cases left in the input.
