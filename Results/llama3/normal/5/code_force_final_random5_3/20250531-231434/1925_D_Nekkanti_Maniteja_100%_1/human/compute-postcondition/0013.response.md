The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 2 * `c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`, `a` is `m * f`, `i` is 2, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus the three integers read, `f` is an integer**
