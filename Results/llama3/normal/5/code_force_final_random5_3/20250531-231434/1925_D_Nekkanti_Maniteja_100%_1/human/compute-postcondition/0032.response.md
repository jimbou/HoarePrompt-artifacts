Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * 0 * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is `f * m`, `f` is an integer, `i` is 2, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `f`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `s` is updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value, which was `c * 0 * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`. The stdin still contains no more test cases.
