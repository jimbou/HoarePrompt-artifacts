This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo 10^9 + 7, sums up all f_i values, and then computes a value s based on the formula k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * m + k * c * a, where c is the modular multiplicative inverse and a is the sum of f_i values. Finally, it prints the value of s modulo 10^9 + 7 for each test case.
