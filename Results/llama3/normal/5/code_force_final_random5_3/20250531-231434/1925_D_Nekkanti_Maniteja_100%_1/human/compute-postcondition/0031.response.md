State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `M` is 10^9 + 7, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * 0 * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is `f * m`, `f` is an integer, `i` is 2, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no more test cases.**
