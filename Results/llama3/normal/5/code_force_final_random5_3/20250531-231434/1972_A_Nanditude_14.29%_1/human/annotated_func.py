#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where the first element is a positive integer, the second element is a list of non-decreasing positive integers, and the third element is a list of non-decreasing positive integers.
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of lists in descending order, where each sublist contains a positive integer, a list of non-decreasing positive integers, and another list of non-decreasing positive integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:Sorts a list of lists in descending order, where each sublist contains a positive integer and two lists of non-decreasing positive integers, and returns the sorted list.
