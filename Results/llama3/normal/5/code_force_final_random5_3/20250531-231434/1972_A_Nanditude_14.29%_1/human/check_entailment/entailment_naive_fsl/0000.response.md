Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem states that when a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing. However, the program does not sort the array a in non-decreasing order after inserting the new problem w.

For example, consider the input:

    2
    
    6
    
    1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
    
    800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000

The program will propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and insert it into the array a, resulting in [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]. However, the program does not sort the array a in non-decreasing order, so the next iteration will not correctly compare the difficulties of the problems.

A correct implementation would sort the array a in non-decreasing order after inserting the new problem w.
