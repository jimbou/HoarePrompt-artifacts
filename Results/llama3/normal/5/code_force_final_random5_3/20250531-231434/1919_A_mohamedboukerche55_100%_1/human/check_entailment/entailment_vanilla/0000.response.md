Reasoning:

The problem requires determining who will win a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, adds them together, and checks if the sum is even or odd.

If the sum is even, the program prints "Bob", indicating that Bob will win the game. If the sum is odd, the program prints "Alice", indicating that Alice will win the game.

The reasoning behind this approach is that the game can be viewed as a series of moves, where each move consists of exchanging wallets and removing a coin. Since the number of coins in each wallet is finite, the game will eventually end when one player's wallet is empty.

The key insight is that the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) determines the outcome of the game. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win, and if it is odd, Alice will win.

This is because, regardless of the specific moves made by the players, the total number of coins will always change by an odd amount (1 coin is removed in each move). Therefore, if the total number of coins is even, it will remain even after each move, and Bob will eventually win. If the total number of coins is odd, it will remain odd after each move, and Alice will eventually win.

Correctness: **True**
