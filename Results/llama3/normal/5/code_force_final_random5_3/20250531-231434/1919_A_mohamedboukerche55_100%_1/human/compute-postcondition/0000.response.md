Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `input()` to `t` after converting it to an integer using `int()`.
2. `input()` reads the next line from stdin, which contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000).
3. The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`.

Now, let's calculate the output state:

* `t` is assigned the value of the integer read from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
* The stdin still contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**
