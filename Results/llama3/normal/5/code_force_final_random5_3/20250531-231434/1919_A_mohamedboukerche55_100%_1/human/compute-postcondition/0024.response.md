Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), i is t-1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin is empty, s is a string containing a space-separated list of two integers, a and b are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). If the sum of a and b is even, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables are as follows:

- `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), as it was initially.
- `i` is now `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times.
- `a` and `b` are still integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), as they were initially.
- `stdin` is empty, as all the input lines have been processed.
- `s` is a string containing a space-separated list of two integers, as it was initially.
- The output is either 'Bob' or 'Alice', depending on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, respectively.
