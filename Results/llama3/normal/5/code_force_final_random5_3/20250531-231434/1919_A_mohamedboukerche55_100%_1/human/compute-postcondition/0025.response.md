Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input and determines whether the sum of each pair is even or odd. For each pair, it prints 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. The function processes a specified number of pairs, as indicated by an initial integer input.**
