Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by determining whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob will win; if the sum is odd, Alice will win. The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of the coins is even or odd and printing the corresponding winner.

Correctness: **True**
