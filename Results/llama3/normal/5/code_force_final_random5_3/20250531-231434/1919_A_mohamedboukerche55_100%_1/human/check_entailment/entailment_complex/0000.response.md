Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd.

The program's logic is based on the observation that if the sum of the coins is even, Bob will win, and if the sum is odd, Alice will win. This is because the game can be viewed as a series of moves where each player tries to force the other player to make a move that will lead to their own loss. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob can always make a move that will leave Alice with an even number of coins, forcing her to make a move that will lead to her loss. Conversely, if the sum is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an odd number of coins, forcing him to make a move that will lead to his loss.

The program correctly implements this logic by reading the input pairs of integers, calculating the sum of each pair, and printing 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

Correctness: **True**
