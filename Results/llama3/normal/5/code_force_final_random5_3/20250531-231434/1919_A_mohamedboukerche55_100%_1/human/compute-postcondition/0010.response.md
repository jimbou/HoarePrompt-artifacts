To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `t` is at least 1, it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `s` is a string containing two integers separated by a space, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers.**
