Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining who will win the game between Alice and Bob, given the number of coins in their wallets. The game involves exchanging wallets and removing coins, with the player who cannot make a valid move losing.

The provided Python program reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers (a and b) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

The program then checks if the sum of a and b is even. If it is, the program prints 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win the game. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win.

The reasoning behind this logic is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity game. The player who starts with the higher number of coins will always have the option to swap wallets and then remove a coin, forcing the other player to have an even number of coins. This means that the player who starts with the higher number of coins will always win if the sum of the coins is even.

However, if the sum of the coins is odd, the player who starts with the lower number of coins can always swap wallets and then remove a coin, forcing the other player to have an odd number of coins. This means that the player who starts with the lower number of coins will always win if the sum of the coins is odd.

Therefore, the program's logic is correct, and it will correctly determine who will win the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
