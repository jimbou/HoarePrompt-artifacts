To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1 and `i` to be 0 (since the loop starts from 0).

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
