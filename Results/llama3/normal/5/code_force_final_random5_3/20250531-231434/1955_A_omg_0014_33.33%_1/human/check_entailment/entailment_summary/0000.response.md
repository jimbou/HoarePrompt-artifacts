Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program correctly reads the input, calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) and at the promotion price (a * d, where d is half of c), and prints the smaller of these two costs.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price as a * d, where d is half of c. This is incorrect because the promotion price is for two yogurts, not one. The correct calculation for the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price should be (n // 2) * c + (n % 2) * b, where n // 2 is the number of pairs of yogurts and n % 2 is the number of single yogurts.

Correctness: **False**
