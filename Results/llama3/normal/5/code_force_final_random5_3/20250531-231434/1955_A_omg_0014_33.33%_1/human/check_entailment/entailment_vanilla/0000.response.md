Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.
2. Inside the function, it reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
3. The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times. In each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, which represent the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.
4. The program calculates `d` as half of `c`, which represents the price of one yogurt if bought in pairs.
5. The program then checks if buying `a` yogurts at the regular price `b` is cheaper than buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price `d`. If it is, the program prints the total cost `a * b`.
6. If buying at the regular price is not cheaper, the program prints the total cost `a * d`, rounded to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a minor issue with the program. The `round()` function is not necessary, as the result of `a * d` will always be an integer (since `a` and `d` are integers). Therefore, the program can be simplified by removing the `round()` function.

Correctness: **True**
