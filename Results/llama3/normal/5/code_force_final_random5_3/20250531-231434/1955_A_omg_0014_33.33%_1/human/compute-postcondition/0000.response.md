Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `n` inputs: each input is a line containing three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `n` (1 <= `a`, `b`, `n` <= 100)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the first input from stdin, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The remaining `n` inputs in stdin are lines each containing three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `n` (1 <= `a`, `b`, `n` <= 100).
