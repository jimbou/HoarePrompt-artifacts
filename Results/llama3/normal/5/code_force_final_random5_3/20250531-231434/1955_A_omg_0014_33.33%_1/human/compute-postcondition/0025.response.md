Functionality: **This function reads a series of inputs from the standard input, where the first input is a positive integer t, and the remaining t inputs are lines each containing three positive integers n, a, and b. For each line of three integers, it calculates the product of a and b, and the product of a and half of c. It then prints the smaller of these two products, rounding the product of a and half of c to the nearest integer if necessary. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results for each input line.**
