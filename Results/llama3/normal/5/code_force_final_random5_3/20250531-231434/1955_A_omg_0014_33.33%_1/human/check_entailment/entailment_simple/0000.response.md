Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes the number of test cases (t) as input, followed by t lines, each containing three integers: n (the number of yogurts), a (the price for one yogurt), and b (the price for two yogurts on promotion).

The program then calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts by comparing the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) with the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d), where d is half of the promotion price (b / 2).

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the minimum cost by comparing the product of a and b with the product of a and d, which is incorrect. The correct comparison should be between the product of a and b with the product of a and c (the promotion price), not d.

Moreover, the program uses the rounded product of a and d when the product of a and b is greater than the product of a and d. This is also incorrect, as the program should use the product of a and c (the promotion price) instead of d.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
