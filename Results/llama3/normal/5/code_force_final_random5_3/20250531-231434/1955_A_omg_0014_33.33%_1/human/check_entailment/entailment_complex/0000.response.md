Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes the number of test cases t as input, followed by t lines each containing three integers n, a, and b.

The program calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) and the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d), where d is half of the promotion price b. It then prints the smaller of these two costs, rounding the promotion price cost to the nearest integer if necessary.

The program correctly handles the cases where the regular price is less than the promotion price (e.g., the third test case in the example), and where the regular price is greater than or equal to the promotion price (e.g., the fourth test case in the example).

However, the program has a logical error. The variable "a" is used to store the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, but it is also used to calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b). This is incorrect, as the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price should be calculated as n * b, not a * b.

Correctness: **False**
