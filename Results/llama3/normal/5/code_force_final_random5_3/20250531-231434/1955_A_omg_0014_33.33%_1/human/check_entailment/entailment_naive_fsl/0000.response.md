Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the number of yogurts to buy is 3, the program will always choose to buy two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price, even if it would be cheaper to buy all three yogurts at the regular price.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:
3 5 11

The program will output 15, but the correct answer is 15, which is achieved by buying two yogurts at the promotion price (11) and one yogurt at the regular price (5). However, the program does not consider the case where buying all three yogurts at the regular price (5 * 3 = 15) is actually cheaper.

The correct solution should compare the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price, and choose the cheaper option.
