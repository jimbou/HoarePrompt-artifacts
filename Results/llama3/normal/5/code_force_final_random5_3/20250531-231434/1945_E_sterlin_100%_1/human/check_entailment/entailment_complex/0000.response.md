Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number x in a permutation p of size n using binary search, with the option to perform up to 2 swaps before running the algorithm. The program consists of multiple functions that read input from standard input, process the input, and output the result.

The program first reads the number of test cases t using function func_1(). Then, for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation n and the number to be found x using function func_2(). It also reads the permutation p using function func_3().

The program then creates a dictionary num_indx to store the indices of the numbers in the permutation. It initializes two variables left and right to 0 and n, respectively, to represent the range of the binary search.

The program then enters a while loop that continues until left + 1 is no longer less than right. Inside the loop, it calculates the mid index and checks if the number at the mid index is less than or equal to x. If it is, it updates left to mid; otherwise, it updates right to mid.

After the loop, the program checks if the number at the left index is equal to x. If it is, it outputs 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. If the number at the left index is not equal to x and x is not in the seen list, it outputs 1 and the indices of the left index and the index of x in the num_indx dictionary.

If the number at the left index is not equal to x and x is in the seen list, the program sets the seen value of the number at the left index to 0 and creates a list temp of indices of numbers that are not in the seen list. It then outputs 2 and the indices of the first index in temp, the index of x in the num_indx dictionary, the first index in temp, and the left index.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search algorithm with the option to perform up to 2 swaps before running the algorithm. It correctly handles the cases where the number to be found is in the permutation and where it is not.

Correctness: **True**
