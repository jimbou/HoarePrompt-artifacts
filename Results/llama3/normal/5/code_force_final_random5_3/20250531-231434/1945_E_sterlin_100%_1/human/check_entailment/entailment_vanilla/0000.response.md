Reasoning:

The given program is a solution to the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `x` using `func_2()`.
3. It then reads the permutation `p` using `func_3()`.
4. The program then applies the binary search algorithm to find the position of `x` in the permutation. However, since the permutation is not sorted, it may need to swap elements to make the binary search work correctly.
5. The program checks if the element at the found position `l` is equal to `x`. If not, it swaps the elements at positions `l` and `x` to make the binary search work correctly.
6. The program then outputs the number of operations performed (0 or 1) and the positions of the swapped elements (if any).

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few potential issues:

* The program assumes that the input permutation is a valid permutation of length `n`, i.e., it contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. If the input permutation is invalid, the program may produce incorrect results.
* The program uses a simple binary search algorithm, which may not be the most efficient approach for large permutations.

Overall, the program's correctness is **True**, assuming that the input permutation is valid and the problem description is followed correctly.

Correctness: **True**
