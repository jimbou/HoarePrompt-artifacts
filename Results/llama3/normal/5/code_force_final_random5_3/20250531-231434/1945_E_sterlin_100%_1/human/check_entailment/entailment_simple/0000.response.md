Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the cases where the target number x is not found in the permutation p. The program also correctly determines the number of operations needed to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x.

The program first creates a dictionary num_indx to store the indices of the numbers in the permutation p. It then initializes the seen array to keep track of the numbers that have been seen during the binary search.

The binary search loop is implemented correctly, and the program updates the left and right pointers based on the comparison of p[mid] and x.

After the binary search loop, the program checks if p[left] is equal to x. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no operations are needed.

If p[left] is not equal to x, the program checks if x has been seen during the binary search. If x has not been seen, the program prints 1 and the indices of the swap operation that needs to be performed to move x to the correct position.

If x has been seen, the program prints 2 and the indices of the two swap operations that need to be performed to move x to the correct position.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the cases where the target number x is not found in the permutation p.

Correctness: **True**
