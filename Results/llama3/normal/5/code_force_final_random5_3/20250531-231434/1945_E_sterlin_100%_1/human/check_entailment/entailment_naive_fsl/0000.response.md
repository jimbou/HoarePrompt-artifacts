Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the program to perform binary search on a permutation after at most 2 swaps to find the target number x. However, the provided program does not implement the binary search algorithm or the swapping operation as described in the problem description. It only defines some input/output functions but does not use them to solve the problem.

A correct program should first find the index of the target number x in the permutation, then perform at most 2 swaps to move the target number to the correct position, and finally perform binary search to find the target number. The provided program does not implement these steps, so it is incorrect.
