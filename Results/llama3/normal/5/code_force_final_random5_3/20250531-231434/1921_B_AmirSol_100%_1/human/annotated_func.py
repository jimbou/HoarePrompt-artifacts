#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum number of positions where s1 and s2 have different characters, which is either the number of positions where s1 has '0' and s2 has '1' or the number of positions where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the maximum number of positions where two input strings of equal length, consisting of '0' and '1' characters, have different characters. It takes two strings and their length as input, and returns an integer value representing the maximum difference in character positions between the two strings.
