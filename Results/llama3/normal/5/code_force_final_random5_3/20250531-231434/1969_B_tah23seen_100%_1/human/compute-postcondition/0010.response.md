Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5. If the first character of `s` is '1', then `cost` is 2 and `one` is 2. If the first character of `s` is '0', then `one` is 1 and `cost` is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `one` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is '1', then `one` is now 2, and `cost` is also 2. If the first character of `s` is '0', then `one` is now 1, and `cost` is either 1 or 2, depending on the previous value of `cost`. The length and content of `s` remain unchanged.
