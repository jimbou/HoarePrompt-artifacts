Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length of at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, the first character of `s` is '1', `cost` is 0, and `one` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `one` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `one` being equal to 1. The other variables, `s` and `cost`, remain unchanged. The length and composition of `s` are still the same, and `cost` is still 0.
