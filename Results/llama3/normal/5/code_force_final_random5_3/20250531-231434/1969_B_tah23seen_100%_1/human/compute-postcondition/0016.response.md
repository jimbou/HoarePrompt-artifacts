The value of `cost` is increased by `one + 1`. The value of `one` can be 0, 1, or 2, so the value of `one + 1` can be 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the value of `cost` can be increased by 1, 2, or 3. The initial value of `cost` can be 1, 2, or 3, so the final value of `cost` can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, `one` is either 0, 1 or 2, `cost` is either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.**
