Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the second character in the string `s`. If `i` is '1', then `one` is either 1, 2 or 3, and `cost` is either 1, 2 or 3. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, then `one` is either 0, 1 or 2, and `cost` is either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Otherwise, `one` is either 0, 1 or 2, and `cost` is either 1, 2 or 3.***
