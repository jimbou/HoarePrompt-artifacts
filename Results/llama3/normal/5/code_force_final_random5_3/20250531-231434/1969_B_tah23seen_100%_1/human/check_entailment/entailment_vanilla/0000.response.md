Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum total cost. The function iterates through the string, keeping track of the number of consecutive '1's (`one`) and the total cost (`cost`). When it encounters a '0' after a sequence of '1's, it increments the cost by the length of the sequence plus one.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The cost increment should be the length of the sequence of '1's, not the length of the sequence plus one. This is because the cost of a cyclic shift operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring, not the length plus one.

For example, in the test case "101011", the correct cost increment when encountering the '0' after the first '1' should be 1, not 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
