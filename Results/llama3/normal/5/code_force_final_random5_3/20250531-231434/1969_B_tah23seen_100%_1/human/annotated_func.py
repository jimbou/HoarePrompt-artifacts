#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and the length of s is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, and `cost` is the total number of '1's in the string `s` plus the number of '0's that follow a '1' in the string `s`.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of '1's in the string `s` plus the number of '0's that follow a '1' in the string `s`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total number of '1's in the input string `s` plus the number of '0's that immediately follow a '1' in the string. It accepts a string `s` consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, and returns an integer representing the calculated cost.
