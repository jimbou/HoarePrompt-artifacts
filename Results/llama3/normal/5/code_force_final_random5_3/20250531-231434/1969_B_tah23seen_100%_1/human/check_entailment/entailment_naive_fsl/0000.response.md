Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The optimal strategy is to choose the substring "10" and perform a cyclic shift, resulting in the sorted string "01". The length of the substring is 2, so the cost is 2, but the program outputs 2 which is incorrect because the cost is 1.

The issue with the program is that it does not consider the case where a substring can be shifted to the left, not just to the right. The program only checks for substrings that start with a '1' and end with a '0', but it does not check for substrings that start with a '0' and end with a '1'. This results in an incorrect count of the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.
