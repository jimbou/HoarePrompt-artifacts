Output State: **`one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, and `cost` is the total number of '1's in the string `s` plus the number of '0's that follow a '1' in the string `s`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `one` will hold the total count of '1's in the string `s`, and the variable `cost` will hold the total count of '1's in the string `s` plus the count of '0's that immediately follow a '1' in the string `s`.
