Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5. If the first character of `s` is '1', then `one` is 2 and `cost` is 2. If the first character of `s` is '0', then `one` is 1 and `cost` is either 1 or 2. If the first character of `s` is '1' and `one` is greater than 0, then `cost` is 3 and `one` is 1. If the first character of `s` is '1' and `one` is 0, then `cost` is 1 and `one` is 1. If the first character of `s` is '0', then `one` is 0 and `cost` is 1.***
