Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum total cost. The function iterates through the string, counting the number of '1's and the number of '0's that follow a '1'. The total cost is calculated as the sum of these two counts.

The reasoning behind this approach is that each '1' in the string needs to be shifted to the right of all the '0's that follow it, and each '0' that follows a '1' needs to be shifted to the left of all the '1's that precede it. By counting the number of '1's and the number of '0's that follow a '1', the function effectively calculates the minimum number of shifts required to sort the string.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if the input string is already sorted, the function returns 0, which is the correct minimum cost.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
