Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum total cost.

The function works by iterating through the string `s` and keeping track of the total number of '1's (`one`) and the total cost. Whenever it encounters a '0' that follows a '1', it increments the cost by the number of '1's seen so far plus one. This is because a cyclic shift operation is needed to move the '1's to the left of the '0'.

The function returns the total cost, which is the sum of the number of '1's and the number of '0's that follow a '1'.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost. It iterates through the string only once, keeping track of the necessary information, and returns the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
