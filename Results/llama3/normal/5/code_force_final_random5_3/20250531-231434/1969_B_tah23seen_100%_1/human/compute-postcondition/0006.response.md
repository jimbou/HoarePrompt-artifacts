Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length of at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the first character in the string `s` and equals '0', `cost` is `one + 1`, and `one` is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been updated to be `one + 1`, which is a specific value based on the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still consists of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length of at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is still the first character in the string `s` and equals '0', and `one` is still greater than 0.
