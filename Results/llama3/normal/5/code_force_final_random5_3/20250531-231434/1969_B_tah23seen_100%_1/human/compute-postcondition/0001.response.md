According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since the length of `s` is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, we can adjust the state of `s` to ensure that it has at least one character. We can also adjust the state of `i` to be the first character in the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length of at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the first character in the string `s`, `cost` is 0, `one` is 0**
