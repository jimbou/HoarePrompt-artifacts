Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s with a length of at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5. If the first character of `s` is '1', then `cost` is 0 and `one` is 1. If the first character of `s` is '0', then `one` is 0. If `one` is greater than 0, then `cost` is `one + 1`.***
