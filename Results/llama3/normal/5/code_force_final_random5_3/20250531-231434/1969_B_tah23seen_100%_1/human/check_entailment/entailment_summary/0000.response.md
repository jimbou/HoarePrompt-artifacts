Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that calculates the cost by iterating through the string `s` and incrementing the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after a '1'. The cost is also incremented by the number of '1's in the string.

However, the program has a logical error. The cost calculation is incorrect. The correct approach is to find the minimum number of operations required to sort the string, which is equivalent to finding the length of the longest decreasing subsequence in the string.

The program's logic is flawed because it increments the cost by the number of '1's in the string, which is not necessary. The cost should only be incremented when a '0' is encountered after a '1', and the increment should be 1, not the number of '1's.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. In such cases, the cost should be 0.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
