Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of "U"s in the input string. The program reads the input data, counts the number of "U"s in the string, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if the count is even. This logic is consistent with the problem description, which states that Alice will win the game if the number of "U"s is odd.

Correctness: **True**
