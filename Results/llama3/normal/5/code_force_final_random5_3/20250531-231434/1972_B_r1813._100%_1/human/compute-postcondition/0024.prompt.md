Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, index is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with each test case containing two inputs: a positive integer and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer and the rest are strings of "U" and "D"
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    s = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    count_u = s.count('U')
    if count_u % 2 == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, index is 3, data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer and the rest are strings of "U" and "D", n is a positive integer, s is a string of "U" and "D", count_u is an integer representing the number of "U"s in s. If count_u is an odd number, 'YES' is printed. If count_u is an even number, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, index is 5, data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer and the rest are strings of "U" and "D", n is a positive integer equal to the value of data at the original index, s is a string of "U" and "D" equal to the value of data at the original index + 1, count_u is an integer representing the number of "U"s in s. If count_u is odd, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, index is 7, data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer and the rest are strings of "U" and "D", n is an integer equal to the value of data at the original index + 2, s is a string of "U" and "D" equal to the value of data at the original index + 3, count_u is an integer representing the number of "U"s in the new s. If count_u is odd, 'YES' is printed. If count_u is even, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
