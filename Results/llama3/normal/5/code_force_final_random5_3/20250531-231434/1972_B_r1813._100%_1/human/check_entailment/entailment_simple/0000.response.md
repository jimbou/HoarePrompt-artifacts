Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem statement asks to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally. The key observation is that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of the players will win. The program uses the fact that if the number of "U"s (facing-up coins) is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win.

The program correctly reads the input, counts the number of "U"s in the string, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if it's even. The logic is sound, and the program should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
