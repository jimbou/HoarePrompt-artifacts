Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine who will win the game. The program only checks if the number of 'U's is odd or even, but this is not sufficient to determine the winner. The game's outcome depends on the arrangement of 'U's and 'D's, not just the count of 'U's.

For example, consider the input "4 UUUU". The program will output "YES", but the correct output should be "NO" because Bob can win the game by choosing the second or third 'U', forcing Alice to choose the remaining 'U's and ultimately losing.

The program does not consider the arrangement of 'U's and 'D's, which is crucial in determining the winner of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
