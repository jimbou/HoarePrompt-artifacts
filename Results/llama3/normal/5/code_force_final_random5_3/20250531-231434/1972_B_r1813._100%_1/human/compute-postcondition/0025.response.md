Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then checks if the number of "U"s in the string is odd or even. If the count of "U"s is odd, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
