#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t-1, index is 2t+1, data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer and the rest are strings of "U" and "D", n is an integer equal to the value of data at the original index + 2(t-1), s is a string of "U" and "D" equal to the value of data at the original index + 2t-1, count_u is an integer representing the number of "U"s in the new s. If count_u is odd, 'YES' is printed. If count_u is even, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then checks if the number of "U"s in the string is odd or even. If the count of "U"s is odd, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
