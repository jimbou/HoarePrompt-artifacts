The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, index is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with each test case containing two inputs: a positive integer and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer and the rest are strings of "U" and "D"**
