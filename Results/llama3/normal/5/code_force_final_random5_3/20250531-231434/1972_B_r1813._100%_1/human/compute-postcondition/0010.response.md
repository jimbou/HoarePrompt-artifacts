The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, index is 3, data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer and the rest are strings of "U" and "D", n is a positive integer, s is a string of "U" and "D", count_u is an integer representing the number of "U"s in s. If count_u is an odd number, 'YES' is printed. If count_u is an even number, 'NO' is printed.**
