Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The problem asks to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then checks if the number of "U"s in the string is odd or even. If the count of "U"s is odd, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if the number of "U"s is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of "U"s, forcing him to lose. On the other hand, if the number of "U"s is even, Bob can always make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of "U"s, forcing her to lose.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for the given test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
