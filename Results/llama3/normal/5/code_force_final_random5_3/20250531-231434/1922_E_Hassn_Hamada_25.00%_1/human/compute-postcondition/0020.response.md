According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. If `size` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `size` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(number + 1)` and must be greater than 0, and `i` is `size-1`. So for the loop to be executed, `size` must be at least 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`result` is returned with an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to `size-1`, `size` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
