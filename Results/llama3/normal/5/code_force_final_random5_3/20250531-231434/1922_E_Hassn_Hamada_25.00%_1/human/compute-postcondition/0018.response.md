Output State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to size-1, size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1) and must be greater than 0, i is size-1**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the sequence will contain all integers from 0 to size-1, where size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of (number + 1). The loop variable i will have reached its final value, which is size-1.
