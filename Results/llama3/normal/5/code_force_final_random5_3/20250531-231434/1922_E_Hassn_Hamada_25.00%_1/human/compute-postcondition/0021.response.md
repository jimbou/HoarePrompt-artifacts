The code `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` updates the value of an element in the `sequence` list. Since `i` is 0, the index of the element being updated is `-result - 1`. The value of this element is increased by `result`.

Output State: **`result` is returned with an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to `size-1`, where the element at index `-result - 1` is increased by `result`, `size` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
