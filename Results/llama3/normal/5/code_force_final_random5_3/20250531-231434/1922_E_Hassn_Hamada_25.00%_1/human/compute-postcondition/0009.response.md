To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `size` and `number`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `number` is a positive integer not equal to 0 and greater than or equal to 3.

To guarantee the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is still less than or equal to `number`. Since `size` can be 1, 2, or 3, we need to consider the maximum value of `(1 << size + 1) - 1`, which occurs when `size` is 3.

When `size` is 3, `(1 << size + 1) - 1` becomes `(1 << 4) - 1 = 15`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, `number` must be greater than or equal to 16.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0 and number must be greater than or equal to 16, sequence is a list of integers, size is either 1 or 2 or 3.**
