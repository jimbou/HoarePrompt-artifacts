The code `sequence.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `sequence`. Since `i` is 0, the list `sequence` now contains one more element, which is 0.

Output State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that contains at least one element which is 0, size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1) and must be greater than 0, i is 0**
