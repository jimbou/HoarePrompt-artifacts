Output State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0 and number must be greater than or equal to 16, sequence is a list of integers, size is either 2 or 3 or 4.**

The code increments the value of `size` by 1. Since `size` was initially either 1, 2, or 3, its new value will be either 2, 3, or 4. The other variables, `number` and `sequence`, are not affected by this code snippet. The function still returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence.
