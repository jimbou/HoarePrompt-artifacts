Output State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers, size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1).**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the function will return the size of the generated sequence, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of the input number plus 1. The input number is still a positive integer not equal to 0, and the sequence is still a list of integers.
