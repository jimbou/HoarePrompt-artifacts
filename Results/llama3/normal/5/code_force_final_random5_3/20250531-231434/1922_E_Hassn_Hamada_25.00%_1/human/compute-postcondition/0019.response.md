Output State: **`result` is returned with an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to `size-1`, `size` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(number + 1)` and must be greater than 0, `i` is `size-1`.**

In this output state, the function `func_1` is called with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`, and the returned value is assigned to the variable `result`. The values of the other variables, including `number`, `sequence`, `size`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
