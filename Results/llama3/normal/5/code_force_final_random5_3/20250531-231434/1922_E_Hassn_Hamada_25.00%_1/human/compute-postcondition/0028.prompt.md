You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers.
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, which is an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, where the sequence is a list of integers and the current number is 0.
    #State: The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers.
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers, size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1).
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to size-1, size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1) and must be greater than 0, i is size-1
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: `result` is returned with an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to `size-1`, where the element at index `-result - 1` is increased by `result`, the element at index `-result - 2` is increased by `result`, ..., the element at index `-result - size` is increased by `result`, `size` is at least 1, `i` is `size-1`.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the sum of the size of the generated sequence and the result, where the result is an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, the size is at least 1, and the sequence is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to size-1 with some elements increased by the result.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0, which is an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, where the sequence is a list of integers and the current number is 0.

Case_2: The program returns the sum of the size of the generated sequence and the result, where the result is an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, the size is at least 1, and the sequence is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to size-1 with some elements increased by the result.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
