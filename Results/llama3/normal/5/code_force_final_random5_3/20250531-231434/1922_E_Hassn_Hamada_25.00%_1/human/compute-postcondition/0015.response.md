The code appends the value of `i` to the `sequence` list. Since `i` is 1, the `sequence` list now contains an additional element, which is 1. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers that contains at least one element which is 0 and an additional element which is 1, size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1) and must be greater than 0, i is 1**
