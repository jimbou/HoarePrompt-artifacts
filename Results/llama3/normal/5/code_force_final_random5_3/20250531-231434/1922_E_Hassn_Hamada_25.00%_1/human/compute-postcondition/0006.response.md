Output State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0 and number must be greater than or equal to 3, sequence is a list of integers, size is 2.**

In this output state, the value of the variable `size` has been updated to 2, as it was incremented by 1 from its initial value of 1. The other variables, `number` and `sequence`, remain unchanged, and the function still returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence.
