To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `size`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `size` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `size` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`result` is returned with an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to `size-1`, where the element at index `-result - 1` is increased by `result`, `size` is at least 1, `i` is 1**
