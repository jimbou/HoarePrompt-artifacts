Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the sequence by adding values to certain elements. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the size of the sequence, generates the sequence, and modifies it by adding values to certain elements. The function returns the sum of the size of the generated sequence and the result of a recursive call to another function.
