To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This condition involves the variables `size` and `number`.

Given that `size` is 1 and `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, we need to adjust the state of `number` to guarantee the loop can execute at least once.

The condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1` evaluates to `(1 << 2) - 1 = 3` when `size` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `number` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0 and number must be greater than or equal to 3, sequence is a list of integers, size is 1.**
