The variable in the loop head is size and number, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables size and number. If (1 << size + 1) - 1 is less than or equal to number, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, size is 2 and number is a positive integer and not equal to 0 and number must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, size must be less than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of (number + 1), so size must be less than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0 and number must be greater than or equal to 3, sequence is a list of integers, size must be less than or equal to 2**
