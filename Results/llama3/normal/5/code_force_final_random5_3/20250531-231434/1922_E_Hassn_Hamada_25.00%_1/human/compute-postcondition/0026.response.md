Output State: **`result` is returned with an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to `size-1`, where the element at index `-result - 1` is increased by `result`, the element at index `-result - 2` is increased by `result`, ..., the element at index `-result - size` is increased by `result`, `size` is at least 1, `i` is `size-1`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the `sequence` list has been modified accordingly. Each element in the `sequence` list, starting from the last element and moving backwards, has been increased by the value of `result`. The `result` variable still represents the size of the generated sequence, and the `number` variable remains unchanged. The `size` variable is still at least 1, and the `i` variable has reached its final value of `size-1`.
