The code `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` increments the value of the element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` list by `result`. 

Since `i` is 1, the index `-result - i - 1` is equal to `-result - 2`. 

The element at index `-result - 2` in the `sequence` list is increased by `result`. 

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`result` is returned with an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to `size-1`, where the element at index `-result - 1` is increased by `result` and the element at index `-result - 2` is increased by `result`, `size` is at least 1, `i` is 1**
