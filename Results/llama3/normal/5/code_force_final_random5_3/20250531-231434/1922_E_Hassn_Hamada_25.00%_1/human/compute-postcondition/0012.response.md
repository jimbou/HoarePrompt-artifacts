According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. If size is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers, size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `size` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers, size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(number + 1) and must be greater than 0, i is 0**
