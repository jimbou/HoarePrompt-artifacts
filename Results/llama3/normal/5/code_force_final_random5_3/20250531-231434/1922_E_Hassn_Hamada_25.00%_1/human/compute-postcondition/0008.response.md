Output State: **The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0 and number must be greater than or equal to 3, sequence is a list of integers, size is either 1 or 2 or 3.**

In this output state, the value of size has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The function still returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence. The number is still a positive integer and not equal to 0 and number must be greater than or equal to 3. The sequence is still a list of integers. The size is now either 1 or 2 or 3, because it was less than or equal to 2 before the increment.
