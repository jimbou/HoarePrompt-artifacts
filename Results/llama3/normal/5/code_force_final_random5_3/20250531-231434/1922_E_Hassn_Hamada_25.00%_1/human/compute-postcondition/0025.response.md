Output State: **`result` is returned with an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence, `number` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of integers that contains all elements from 0 to `size-1`, where the element at index `-result - 1` is increased by `result`, the element at index `-result - 2` is increased by `result`, and the element at index `-result - 3` is increased by `result`, `size` is at least 1, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the element at index `-result - 3` in the sequence is increased by `result`. The other variables remain unchanged.
