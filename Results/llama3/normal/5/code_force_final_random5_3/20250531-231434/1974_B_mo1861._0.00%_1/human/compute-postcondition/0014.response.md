Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least n+2 unique characters and is not empty, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in `b` and its corresponding value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is n, `c` is the third character in `b`, `s` is a string with three characters where the first character is `len(b) - n - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, the second character is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and the third character is the value of `char_map[c]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending the value of `char_map[c]` to its original value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
