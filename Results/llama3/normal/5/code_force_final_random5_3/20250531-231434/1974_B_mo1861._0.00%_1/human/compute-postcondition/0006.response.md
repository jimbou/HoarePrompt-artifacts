Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 3 unique characters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character that is `len(b) - 3` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is 2, `c` is the third unique character in `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `char_map[c]` has been updated to a character that is `len(b) - 3` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, while the values of `b`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged. The dictionary `char_map` still has only one key-value pair, but the value associated with the key `c` has been updated.
