To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):`

The current state is:
- `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 unique character.
- `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.
- `i` is 0.
- `c` is the first unique character in `b`.

To execute the loop again, we need to consider the following:

- `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))` will iterate over the unique characters in `b`, sorted in ascending order.
- Since `i` is 0, we are currently processing the first unique character in `b`.
- For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more unique character in `b`.

Adjusting the states:

- `b` must have at least 2 unique characters.
- `char_map` is not directly affected by the loop head, so its state remains the same.
- `i` will be incremented to 1, as we are moving to the next unique character.
- `c` will be the second unique character in `b`.

State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 unique characters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is 1, `c` is the second unique character in `b`**
