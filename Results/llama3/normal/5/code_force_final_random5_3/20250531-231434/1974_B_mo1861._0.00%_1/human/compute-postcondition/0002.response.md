Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 unique character, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in `b`**

In this output state, the value of `char_map` has been updated to include a new key-value pair. The key is `c`, which is the first unique character in the string `b`. The value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet. This is calculated using the `ord` function, which returns the ASCII value of a character, and the `chr` function, which returns the character represented by a specific ASCII value. The values of `b`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged.
