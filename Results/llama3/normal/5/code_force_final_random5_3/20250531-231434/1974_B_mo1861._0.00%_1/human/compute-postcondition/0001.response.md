According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `b`, `i`, `c`, and `char_map`. If `b` is not empty and has at least 1 unique character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and `char_map` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed, `b` must have at least 1 unique character, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in `b`, and `char_map` is still an empty dictionary.

State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 unique character, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in `b`**
