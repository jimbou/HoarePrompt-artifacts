Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least n unique characters, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in `b` and its corresponding value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is n-1, `c` is the nth unique character in `b`, `s` is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for c in b:
    s += char_map[c]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least n unique characters and is not empty, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in `b` and its corresponding value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is n-1, `c` is the first character in `b`, `s` is a string with one character that is `len(b) - n` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least n+1 unique characters and is not empty, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in `b` and its corresponding value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is n, `c` is the second character in `b`, `s` is a string with two characters where the first character is `len(b) - n - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet and the second character is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least n+2 unique characters and is not empty, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in `b` and its corresponding value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is n, `c` is the third character in `b`, `s` is a string with three characters where the first character is `len(b) - n - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, the second character is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, and the third character is the value of `char_map[c]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
