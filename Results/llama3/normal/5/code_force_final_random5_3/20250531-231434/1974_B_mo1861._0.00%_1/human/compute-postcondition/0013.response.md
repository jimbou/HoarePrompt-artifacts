To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for c in b:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `c` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `b` has at least one more character. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has at least `n+1` unique characters and is not empty, `c` is the second character in `b`, and `i` is `n`.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must have at least `n+2` unique characters, and `c` must be the next character in `b`. Since `i` is not in the loop head, we cannot adjust its state.

State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least n+2 unique characters and is not empty, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in `b` and its corresponding value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is n, `c` is the third character in `b`, `s` is a string with two characters where the first character is `len(b) - n - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet and the second character is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet**
