Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input and returns the decoded string `s`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program first creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character in the encoded string `b` to its corresponding character in the decoded string `s`. This is done by iterating over the sorted set of unique characters in `b` and assigning each character a value that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted set.

2. The program then iterates over the encoded string `b` and replaces each character with its corresponding character in the decoded string `s` using the `char_map` dictionary.

3. Finally, the program returns the decoded string `s`.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The `char_map` dictionary is created correctly, and the decoding process is performed correctly using the `char_map` dictionary.

Correctness: **True**
