Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a given string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. The decoding process involves replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from the set of distinct characters in `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `num_test_cases` and iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `b` and the string `b` itself.

3. The program defines a function `func_1(b)` that takes the encoded string `b` as input and returns the decoded string `s`.

4. Inside `func_1(b)`, it creates an empty dictionary `char_map` to store the mapping between characters in `b` and their corresponding symmetric characters.

5. It then iterates over the sorted set of distinct characters in `b` (obtained using `sorted(set(b))`) and maps each character `c` to its symmetric character `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted set.

6. After creating the `char_map`, it initializes an empty string `s` to store the decoded string.

7. It then iterates over each character `c` in the encoded string `b` and appends its corresponding symmetric character (obtained from `char_map[c]`) to the decoded string `s`.

8. Finally, it returns the decoded string `s`.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the decoding process described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
