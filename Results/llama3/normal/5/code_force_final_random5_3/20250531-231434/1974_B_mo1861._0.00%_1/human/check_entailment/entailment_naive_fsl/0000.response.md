Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The `func_1` function takes the encoded string `b` as input and initializes an empty dictionary `char_map` to store the mapping between characters in `b` and their corresponding decoded characters.

2. The function then iterates over the sorted set of unique characters in `b` (obtained using `sorted(set(b))`). For each character `c` at index `i`, it maps `c` to the character at index `len(b) - i - 1` in the alphabet (using `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`). This correctly implements the symmetric replacement described in the problem statement.

3. The function then iterates over the characters in `b` and appends the corresponding decoded character (obtained from `char_map`) to the result string `s`.

4. Finally, the function returns the decoded string `s`.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters
* Strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order
* Strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters (although the problem statement specifies that the input will only contain lowercase letters)

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* An empty input string
* A single-character input string

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
