Output State: **b is a string of lowercase Latin letters, char_map is an empty dictionary**.

The code block defines a function to decode a given string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. However, the function is not executed in this code snippet, so the state of `b` remains unchanged. The only change is the creation of an empty dictionary `char_map`.
