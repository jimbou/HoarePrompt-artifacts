Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least n unique characters and is not empty, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in `b` and its corresponding value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is n-1, `c` is the first character in `b`, `s` is a string with one character that is `len(b) - n` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending the character from `char_map` that corresponds to the first character `c` in string `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
