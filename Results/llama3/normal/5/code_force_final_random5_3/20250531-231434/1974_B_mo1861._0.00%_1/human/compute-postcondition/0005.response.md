To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):`. This means we're iterating over the sorted unique characters in string `b`, with `i` being the index and `c` being the character.

Given the current state:

- `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 unique characters.
- `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character that is `len(b) - 2` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.
- `i` is 1.
- `c` is the second unique character in `b`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop head variables `i` and `c`, and the condition that allows the loop to continue, which is the existence of more unique characters in `b`.

1. **`i`**: Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.

2. **`c`**: Currently, `c` is the second unique character in `b`. For the loop to execute again, `c` should be the next unique character in the sorted set of `b`. This implies that `b` must have at least 3 unique characters for the loop to execute one more time.

3. **`b`**: The condition for the loop to execute again is that `b` must have at least 3 unique characters.

4. **`char_map`**: The state of `char_map` is not directly affected by the loop head, as it's not a variable in the loop head. However, its value is dependent on `c`, which changes. But since we're only adjusting states of objects in the loop head, we don't adjust `char_map` directly.

State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 3 unique characters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character that is `len(b) - 2` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is 2, `c` is the third unique character in `b`.**
