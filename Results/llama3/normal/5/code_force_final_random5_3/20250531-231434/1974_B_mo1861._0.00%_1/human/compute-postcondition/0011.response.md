To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for c in b:`. The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `b`. If `b` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has at least n unique characters and is not empty, `i` is n-1, `c` is the first character in `b`, and `s` is a string with one character that is `len(b) - n` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must have at least one more character, and `c` must be the next character in `b`. Since `c` is the first character in `b` at the end of the last iteration, it must be the second character in `b` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least n+1 unique characters and is not empty, `char_map` is a dictionary with n key-value pairs where each key is a unique character in `b` and its corresponding value is a character that is `len(b) - i - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is n, `c` is the second character in `b`, `s` is a string with one character that is `len(b) - n - 1` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet**
