Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 unique characters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character that is `len(b) - 2` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, `i` is 1, `c` is the second unique character in `b`**

In this output state, the value of `char_map[c]` has been updated to a character that is `len(b) - 2` positions ahead of 'a' in the alphabet, since `i` is 1. The values of `b`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged.
