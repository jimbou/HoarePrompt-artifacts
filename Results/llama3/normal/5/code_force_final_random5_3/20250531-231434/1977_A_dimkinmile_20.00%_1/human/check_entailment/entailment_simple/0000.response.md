Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower. The given program checks if n is greater than or equal to m and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise prints 'No'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the parity of n and m. If n is even, m must also be even, and if n is odd, m must also be odd. This is because adding or removing a cube in each move changes the parity of the number of cubes.

The given program does not consider the parity of n and m, and therefore, it may print 'Yes' for cases where it's not possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **False**
