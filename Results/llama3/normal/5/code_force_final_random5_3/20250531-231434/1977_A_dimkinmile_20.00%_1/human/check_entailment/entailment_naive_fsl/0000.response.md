Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n is odd and m is even, the program will print 'Yes' even though it is not possible to end up with an even number of cubes after an odd number of moves. This is because the program only checks if n is greater than or equal to m, but it does not consider the parity of n and m.

For instance, if n = 3 and m = 2, the program will print 'Yes', but it is not possible to end up with 2 cubes after 3 moves (1 move to add a cube, 1 move to add another cube, and 1 move to remove a cube, resulting in 1 cube, not 2).

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
