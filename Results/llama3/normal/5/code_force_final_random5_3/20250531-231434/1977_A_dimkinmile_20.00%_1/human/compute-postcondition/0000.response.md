Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), where t is an integer between 1 and 100.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the first pair of integers from the input, and the stdin now contains t-1 lines of input, each with two integers. The range of `n` and `m` is between 1 and 100, as specified in the initial state. The value of t is still between 1 and 100, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the output state as it is not directly affected by the code.
