Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program takes two integers, n and m, as input and checks if n is greater than or equal to m. If n is greater than or equal to m, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to build a tower with m cubes. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, the program is incorrect. The condition for building a tower with m cubes is not just that n is greater than or equal to m, but also that the difference between n and m is even. This is because Nikita can either add or remove one cube at a time, so the number of moves must be even to end up with an odd number of cubes.

For example, if n = 3 and m = 2, the program will print 'Yes', but it is not possible to build a tower with 2 cubes in 3 moves.

Correctness: **False**
