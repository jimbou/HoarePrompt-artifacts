This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the parentheses based on their nesting depth, and returns a string consisting of the sorted parentheses. The function effectively rearranges the input string to have the most deeply nested parentheses first, while maintaining the overall balance of the parentheses sequence.
