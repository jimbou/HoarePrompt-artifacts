Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 1, The dictionary `d` has three key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the first character of `s` is "(", or -1 if the first character of `s` is ")" and 2 maps to either 2 if the first two characters of `s` are "((", or 0 if the first two characters of `s` are "() or -2 if the first two characters of `s` are "))" and 3 maps to either 3 if the first three characters of `s` are "(((", or 1 if the first three characters of `s` are "(()" or -1 if the first three characters of `s` are "())" or -3 if the first three characters of `s` are ")))".**

In this output state, the dictionary `d` has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is `i + 1` (which is 2) and the value is `d[i] + 1` (which is either 2, 0, or -2 depending on the first two characters of `s`). The other variables remain unchanged.
