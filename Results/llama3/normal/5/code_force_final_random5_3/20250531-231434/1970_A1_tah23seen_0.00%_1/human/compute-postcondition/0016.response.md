Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, i is n, The dictionary d has n key-value pairs: for each j in range(0, n), j maps to either d[j-1] + 1 if s[j-1] is "(", or d[j-1] - 1 if s[j-1] is ")" and the key-value pairs are sorted by their values.**

The first line removes the key-value pair with key n from dictionary d. Since n is the length of s, this key-value pair is removed. The second line sorts the remaining key-value pairs in dictionary d by their values. The sorting is done based on the values of the key-value pairs, not their keys. The resulting dictionary d has the same keys as before (0 to n-1), but the key-value pairs are rearranged so that the values are in ascending order. The other variables s, n, ans, and i are not affected by the code.
