Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `n`, The dictionary `d` has `n+1` key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0 and for each `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `j` maps to either `d[j-1] + 1` if `s[j-1]` is "(", or `d[j-1] - 1` if `s[j-1]` is ")"**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length `n` remains unchanged, the answer `ans` remains an empty string, and the index `i` reaches the end of the string `s`. The dictionary `d` now contains `n+1` key-value pairs, where each key `j` corresponds to the balance of open and close parentheses up to the `j-th` character in the string `s`. If the `j-th` character is an open parenthesis, the value at key `j` is one more than the value at key `j-1`, and if the `j-th` character is a close parenthesis, the value at key `j` is one less than the value at key `j-1`.
