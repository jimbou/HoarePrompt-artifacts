Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, i is n, The dictionary d has n key-value pairs: for each j in range(0, n), j maps to either d[j-1] + 1 if s[j-1] is "(", or d[j-1] - 1 if s[j-1] is ")" and the key-value pairs are sorted by their values.
Code of the loop:
for i, j in d:
    ans += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `s`, `i` is the first key in `d`, `d` has at least 1 key-value pair, `j` is the first value in `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `s` and the character at the second key in `d`, `d` has at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in `d`, `j` is the second value in `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `s`, the character at the third key in `d`, and the character at the third key in `s`, `d` has at least 3 key-value pairs, `i` is the third key in `d`, `j` is the third value in `d`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
