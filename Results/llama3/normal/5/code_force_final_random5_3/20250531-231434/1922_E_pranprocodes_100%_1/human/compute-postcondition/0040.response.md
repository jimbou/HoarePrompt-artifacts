Output State: **x is a positive integer greater than 1 and x is not equal to 1, x is equal to its original value divided by 2, max is either 99999997 or 99999998, min is either -99999998 or -99999999, ans is a list containing either 100000000 and 99999999 and 99999998 or -100000000 and -99999999 and 99999998, t is 2, i is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of t which is 2 is being printed, and the elements of the list ans are being printed in the order they appear in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been divided by 2, and the value of `max` has been decremented by 1. The list `ans` has been appended with the original value of `max`. The values of `min`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The printing of the value of `t` and the elements of the list `ans` continues as before.
