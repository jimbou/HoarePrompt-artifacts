Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1. If `x` is even, then `x` is divided by 2, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, and `ans` contains 100000000, 99999999, and 99999998. If `x` is odd, then `x` is decreased by 1, `min` is either -99999997 or -99999998, and `ans` contains -100000000, -99999999, and -99999998. In both cases, `t` is 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of `t` and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed in the order they appear in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged, so `x` is still a positive integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1, `max` and `min` are still either 99999997 or 99999998 and either -99999997 or -99999998 respectively, `ans` still contains the same elements, `i` is still 1, and stdin still contains no inputs. The value of `t` and the elements of the list `ans` are still being printed in the order they appear in the list.
