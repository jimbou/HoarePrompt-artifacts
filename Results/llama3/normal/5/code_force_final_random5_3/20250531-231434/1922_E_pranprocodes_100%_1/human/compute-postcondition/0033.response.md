Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, `t` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of t which is 1 is being printed, and the elements of the list ans are being printed in the order they appear in the list. If x is even, then max is 99999999 and ans contains 100000000. If x is odd, then min is -99999999, x is equal to its original value minus 1 and ans contains -100000000.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and its parity (even or odd) determines the values of `max`, `min`, and `ans`. The stdin is still empty, and the value of `t` and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed.
