The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `ans`. The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list containing either 100000000, -100000000, 99999999, -99999999, 99999998, or -99999998. After reversing the list, the order of the elements is reversed, but the elements themselves remain the same.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998, -99999999, or -99999997, `ans` is a list containing either -100000000, 100000000, -99999999, 99999999, -99999998, or 99999998 in reverse order, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, and stdin contains no inputs.**
