Output State: **x is 1, max is either 99999997, 99999998 or 99999999, min is either -99999999, -99999998 or -99999997, ans is a list containing either [100000000, 99999999, 99999998], [-100000000, 99999999, 99999998], [100000000, 99999999], [-100000000, 99999999], [100000000, 99999999, -99999999], [-100000000, 99999999, -99999999], [100000000, -99999999] or [-100000000, -99999999], t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is 2, stdin contains no inputs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where x has reached 1, max and min have been updated accordingly, ans contains a list of values that were appended during the loop iterations, t has been incremented to a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, and i remains unchanged at 2. The stdin remains empty as no inputs were provided.
