Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to half its original value if it was even, otherwise `x` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999, -99999998 or -99999997, `ans` is a list containing either [100000000, 99999999, 99999998], [-100000000, 99999999, 99999998], [100000000, 99999999], [-100000000, 99999999], [100000000, 99999999, -99999999], [-100000000, 99999999, -99999999], [100000000, -99999999] or [-100000000, -99999999], `t` is 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains no inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for `t`, which has been incremented by 1 and is now 3. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged, and there are still no inputs in stdin.
