The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer greater than 1, so for the loop to be executed one more time x must not be equal to 1.
State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a list containing either [100000000, 99999999] or [-100000000, 99999999] or 100000000 or -100000000 and -99999999, `t` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains no inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to half its original value. If `x` is odd, `x` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1.**
