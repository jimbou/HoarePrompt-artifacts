Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of integers (the values of X).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = []
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans.append(max)
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans.append(min)
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    ans.reverse()
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 1, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998, -99999999, or -99999997, `ans` is a list containing either -100000000, 100000000, -99999999, 99999999, -99999998, or 99999998 in reverse order, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, and stdin contains no inputs, and the value of `t` which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed in the order they appear in the list, which are either -100000000, 100000000, -99999999, 99999999, -99999998, or 99999998

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: x is 1, max is either 99999997 or 99999998 or 99999999, min is either -99999997 or -99999998 or -99999999, ans is a list containing either -99999999 or 99999999 and either -99999998 or 99999998 and either -100000000 or 100000000, t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of t which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 is being printed, and the list ans is being printed, which contains either -99999999 or 99999999 and either -99999998 or 99999998 and either -100000000 or 100000000

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is 1, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999, -99999998 or -99999997, `ans` is a list containing either [99999998, 99999999, 100000000], [99999998, 99999999, -100000000], [99999999, 100000000], [99999999, -100000000], [-99999999, 99999999, 100000000], [-99999999, 99999999, -100000000], [-99999999, 100000000] or [-99999999, -100000000], `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of `t` which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are either [99999998, 99999999, 100000000], [99999998, 99999999, -100000000], [99999999, 100000000], [99999999, -100000000], [-99999999, 99999999, 100000000], [-99999999, 99999999, -100000000], [-99999999, 100000000] or [-99999999, -100000000] are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
