Output State: **x is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to half its original value if it was even, otherwise x is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, max is either 99999997 or 99999998, min is either -99999999 or -99999998, ans is a list containing either [100000000, 99999999, 99999998] or [-100000000, 99999999, 99999998] or [100000000, 99999999] or [-100000000, 99999999] and -99999999, t is 2, i is 2, stdin contains no inputs.**

The code block modifies the values of `x`, `max`, and `ans`. The value of `x` is halved if it is even, otherwise, it is decremented by 1. The value of `max` is decremented by 1. The list `ans` has the value of `max` appended to it. The values of `min`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin remains empty.
