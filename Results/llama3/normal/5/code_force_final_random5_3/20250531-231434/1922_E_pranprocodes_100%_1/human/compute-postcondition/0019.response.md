Output State: **x is 1, max is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, min is either -99999998, -99999999, or -99999997, ans is a list containing either 100000000, -100000000, 99999999, -99999999, 99999998, or -99999998, t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is 0, and stdin contains no inputs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that x is 1, max is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, min is either -99999998, -99999999, or -99999997, ans is a list containing either 100000000, -100000000, 99999999, -99999999, 99999998, or -99999998, t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is 0, and stdin contains no inputs.
