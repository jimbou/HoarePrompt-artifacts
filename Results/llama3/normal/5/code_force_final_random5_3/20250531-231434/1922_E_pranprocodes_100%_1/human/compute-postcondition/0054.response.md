Output State: **x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.5, max is 99999999, min is -100000000, ans is a list containing 100000000, t is 0, i is 2, stdin contains no inputs.**

In this output state, the value of x is halved due to the operation x = x // 2, and since the initial value of x was even, the resulting value will be a positive integer. The value of max is decremented by 1, and the value of ans is updated to include the initial value of max, which is 100000000. All other variables remain unchanged.
