The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, x must be greater than 1.
State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, `t` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of t which is 1 is being printed, and the elements of the list ans are being printed in the order they appear in the list. If x is even, then max is 99999999 and ans contains 100000000. If x is odd, then min is -99999999, x is equal to its original value minus 1 and ans contains -100000000.**
