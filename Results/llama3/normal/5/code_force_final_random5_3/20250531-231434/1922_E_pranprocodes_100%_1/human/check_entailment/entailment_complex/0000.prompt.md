Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of integers (the values of X).
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: `x` is 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either -100000000, 100000000, -99999999, 99999999, -99999998, or 99999998 in reverse order, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of `t` which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed in the order they appear in the list, which are either -100000000, 100000000, -99999999, 99999999, -99999998, or 99999998.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents a value X. For each X, the function generates a list of integers by repeatedly dividing X by 2 if it's even, or decrementing X by 1 if it's odd, and appending either the maximum possible integer (initially 100000000) or the minimum possible integer (initially -100000000) to the list, depending on whether X is even or odd. The function then prints the length of the list and the list itself in reverse order. The function repeats this process for each test case.
