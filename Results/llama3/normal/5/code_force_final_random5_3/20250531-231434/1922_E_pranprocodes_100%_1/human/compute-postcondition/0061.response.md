Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, max is 99999999, min is -99999998, ans is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and -99999999, t is 1, i is 2, stdin contains no inputs**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `min` has been incremented by 1. The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the original value of `min` (-99999999). The values of `max`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged, and stdin still contains no inputs.
