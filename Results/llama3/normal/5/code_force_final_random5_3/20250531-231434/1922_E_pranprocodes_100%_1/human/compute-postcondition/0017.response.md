Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998, -99999999, or -99999997, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000, -100000000, 99999999, -99999999, 99999998, or -99999998, `t` is 2, `i` is 0, and stdin contains no inputs. If `x` is even, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, and `ans` contains 99999998 or -99999998. If `x` is odd, `min` is either -99999997 or -99999998, and `ans` contains -99999998 or -99999999.***
