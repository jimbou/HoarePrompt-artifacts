Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, max is 99999999, min is -99999999, ans is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, t is 0, i is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of t which is 0 is being printed, and the elements of the list ans are being printed in the order they appear in the list. If x is even, then max is 99999999 and ans contains 100000000. If x is odd, then min is -99999999, x is equal to its original value minus 1 and ans contains -100000000.***
