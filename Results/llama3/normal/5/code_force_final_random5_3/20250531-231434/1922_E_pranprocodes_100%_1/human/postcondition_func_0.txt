This function reads a sequence of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents a value X. For each X, the function generates a list of integers by repeatedly dividing X by 2 if it's even, or decrementing X by 1 if it's odd, and appending either the maximum possible integer (initially 100000000) or the minimum possible integer (initially -100000000) to the list, depending on whether X is even or odd. The function then prints the length of the list and the list itself in reverse order. The function repeats this process for each test case.
