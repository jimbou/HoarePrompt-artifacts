Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and stdin contains no inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, and `ans` contains 100000000. If `x` is odd, `x` is decremented by 1, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains -100000000.***
