The code prints the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order, separated by spaces. The `ans` list contains either -100000000, 100000000, -99999999, 99999999, -99999998, or 99999998 in reverse order.

Since the exact elements of the `ans` list are not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order.

Output: **-100000000, 100000000, -99999999, 99999999, -99999998, or 99999998 (in some order, in reverse order)**
