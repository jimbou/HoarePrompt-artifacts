Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a list containing either [100000000, 99999999] or [-100000000, 99999999] or 100000000 or -100000000 and -99999999, `t` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains no inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to half its original value. If `x` is odd, `x` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no inputs. The conditions on `x` depending on whether it is even or odd also remain the same.
