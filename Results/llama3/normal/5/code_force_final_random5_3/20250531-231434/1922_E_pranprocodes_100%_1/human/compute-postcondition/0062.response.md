Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is a list containing either [100000000, 99999999] or [-100000000, 99999999] or 100000000 or -100000000 and -99999999, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains no inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to half its original value. If `x` is odd, `x` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1.***
