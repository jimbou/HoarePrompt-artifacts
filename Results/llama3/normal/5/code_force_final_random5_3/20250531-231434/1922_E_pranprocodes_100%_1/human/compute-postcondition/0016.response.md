The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the variables `ans`, `min`, and `x`. Here's the combined effect of all lines:

1. `ans.append(min)`: This line appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` is either -99999998 or -99999999, the list `ans` now contains three elements: either 100000000 or -100000000, either 99999999 or -99999999, and either -99999998 or -99999999.
2. `min += 1`: This line increments the value of `min` by 1. Since `min` was either -99999998 or -99999999, it now becomes either -99999997 or -99999998.
3. `x -= 1`: This line decrements the value of `x` by 1. Since `x` was a positive integer greater than 1, it now becomes a positive integer greater than 0.

The values of `max` and `t` remain unchanged, and `i` is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **x is a positive integer greater than 0, max is either 99999998 or 99999999, min is either -99999997 or -99999998, ans is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, either 99999999 or -99999999, and either -99999998 or -99999999, t is 2, and i is 0.**
