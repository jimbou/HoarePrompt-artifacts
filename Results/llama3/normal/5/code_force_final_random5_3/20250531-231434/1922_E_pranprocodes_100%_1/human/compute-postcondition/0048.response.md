The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

Since the `ans` list contains either -99999999 or 99999999 and either -99999998 or 99999998 and either -100000000 or 100000000, the print statement will output these three values.

Output: **-99999999 or 99999999, -99999998 or 99999998, -100000000 or 100000000**
