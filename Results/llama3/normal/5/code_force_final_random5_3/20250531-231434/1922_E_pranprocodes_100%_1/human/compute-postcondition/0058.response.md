Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains no inputs**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
