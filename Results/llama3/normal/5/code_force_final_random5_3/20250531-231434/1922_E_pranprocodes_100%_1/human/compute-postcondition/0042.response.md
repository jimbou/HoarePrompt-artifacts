Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1. If `x` is even, then `x` is divided by 2, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, and `ans` contains 100000000, 99999999, and 99999998. If `x` is odd, then `x` is decreased by 1, `min` is either -99999997 or -99999998, and `ans` contains -100000000, -99999999, and -99999998. In both cases, `t` is 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of `t` and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed in the order they appear in the list.**
