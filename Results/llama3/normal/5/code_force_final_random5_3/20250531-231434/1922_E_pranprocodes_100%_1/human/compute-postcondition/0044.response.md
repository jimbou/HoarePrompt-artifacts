Output State: **x is 1, max is either 99999997 or 99999998 or 99999999, min is either -99999997 or -99999998 or -99999999, ans is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -99999999 and either 99999998 or -99999998, t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of t and the elements of the list ans are being printed in the order they appear in the list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing. In this state, the value of `x` is 1, indicating that the loop has terminated. The values of `max` and `min` depend on the parity of `x` during the last iteration of the loop. If `x` is even, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998 or 99999999, and if `x` is odd, `min` is either -99999997 or -99999998 or -99999999. The list `ans` contains the values appended during the last three iterations of the loop, which are either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -99999999 and either 99999998 or -99999998. The value of `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, indicating the number of iterations the loop has executed. The value of `i` remains 1, and stdin contains no inputs. The value of `t` and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed in the order they appear in the list.
