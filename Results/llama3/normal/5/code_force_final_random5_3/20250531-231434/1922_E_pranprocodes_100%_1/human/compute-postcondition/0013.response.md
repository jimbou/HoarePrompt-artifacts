Output State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -99999999, `t` is 2, `i` is 0, and stdin contains no inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is less than or equal to half its original value. If `x` is odd, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `x` being even or odd and its corresponding value also remain the same.
