According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer greater than 1, so it needs to be adjusted to x is a positive integer greater than 1 and x is not equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1 and x is not equal to 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -99999999, `t` is 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of `t` which is 2 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed in the order they appear in the list. If `x` is even, then `max` is 99999998, `ans` contains 100000000 and 99999999. If `x` is odd, then `min` is -99999998, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1, and `ans` contains -100000000 and -99999999.**
