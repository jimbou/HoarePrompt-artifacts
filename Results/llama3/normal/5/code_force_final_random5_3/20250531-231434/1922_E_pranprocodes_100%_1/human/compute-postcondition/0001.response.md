The code snippet provided reads an integer from stdin, assigns it to `x`, and initializes several variables. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `x`. Since stdin contains at least one input, which is an integer greater than 0, `x` becomes a positive integer. Stdin now contains no inputs.
*   The second and third lines assign constant values to `max` and `min`, respectively. `max` becomes 100000000, and `min` becomes -100000000.
*   The fourth line initializes an empty list `ans`.
*   The fifth line initializes `t` to 0.

No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state's information about `i` being 0 remains valid after the code execution.

Output State: **x is a positive integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty list, t is 0, i is 0, stdin contains no inputs.**
