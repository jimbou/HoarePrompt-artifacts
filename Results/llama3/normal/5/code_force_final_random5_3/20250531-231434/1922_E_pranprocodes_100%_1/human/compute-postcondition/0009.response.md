According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer greater than 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, x must be greater than 1.
State: **`x` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, and stdin contains no inputs.**
