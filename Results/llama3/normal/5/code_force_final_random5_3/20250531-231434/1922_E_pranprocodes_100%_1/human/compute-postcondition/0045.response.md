Output State: **x is 1, max is either 99999997 or 99999998 or 99999999, min is either -99999997 or -99999998 or -99999999, ans is a list containing either -99999999 or 99999999 and either -99999998 or 99999998 and either -100000000 or 100000000, t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is 1, stdin contains no inputs, and the value of t and the elements of the list ans are being printed in the order they appear in the list.**

The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `ans`. The initial state of `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and either 99999999 or -99999999 and either 99999998 or -99999998. After reversing, the order of the elements is changed, so the new state of `ans` is a list containing either -99999999 or 99999999 and either -99999998 or 99999998 and either -100000000 or 100000000. The other variables remain unchanged.
