Output State: **`numbers` is a list of two or more integers, `result` is the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to ... applied to the first integer in the list `numbers` and the second integer in the list `numbers`, and the third integer in the list `numbers`, ..., and the last integer in the list `numbers`, `num` is the last integer in the list `numbers`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `numbers` remains unchanged, the variable `result` holds the cumulative result of applying the function `func_1` to the first integer in the list `numbers` and each subsequent integer in the list, and the variable `num` holds the last integer in the list `numbers`.
