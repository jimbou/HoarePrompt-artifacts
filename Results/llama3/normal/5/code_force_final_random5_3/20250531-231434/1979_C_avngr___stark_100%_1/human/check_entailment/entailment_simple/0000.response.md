Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)`. `func_2` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the result and the next number in the list.

The main program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2` and stores it in `m`. Then, it calculates the bet for each outcome by dividing `m` by the multiplier for that outcome and stores it in `c`. If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the LCM to calculate the bets ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
