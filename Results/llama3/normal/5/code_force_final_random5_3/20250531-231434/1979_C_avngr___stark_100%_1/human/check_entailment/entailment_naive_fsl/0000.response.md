Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem requires to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. However, the program does not provide a solution for this problem. It only defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are not related to the problem description.

The `func_1` function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, and the `func_2` function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers. These functions are not used to solve the problem of distributing coins.

To solve the problem, the program should calculate the bets for each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program does not provide a solution for this problem.

For example, if the input is `n = 3` and `k = [3, 2, 7]`, the program should output `27 41 12`, but it does not provide a solution for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
