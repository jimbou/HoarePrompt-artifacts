Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor. `func_2` applies `func_1` cumulatively to a list of numbers to find the LCM of all the numbers in the list.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome. It then calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2` and distributes the coins among the outcomes by dividing the LCM by each multiplier. If the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the distributed coins for each outcome.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers, distributes the coins, and checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
