According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, result is the first integer in the list numbers. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 integers and the num is the second integer in the list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of two or more integers, `result` is the first integer in the list `numbers`, num is the second integer in the list**
