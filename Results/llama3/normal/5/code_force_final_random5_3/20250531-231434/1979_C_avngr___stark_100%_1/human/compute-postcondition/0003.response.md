To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]:`, which means we are iterating over the list `numbers` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `numbers` is a list of two or more integers.
* `result` is the result of `func_1` applied to the first integer in the list `numbers` and the second integer in the list `numbers`.
* `num` is the second integer in the list `numbers`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. Specifically, we need to consider the state of `num` and `numbers`.

Since we are iterating over `numbers[1:]`, the next iteration will start from the third element of the original list `numbers` (index 2). Therefore, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `numbers` remains the same, as the list itself is not modified.
* `num` should be the third integer in the list `numbers`, since we are moving to the next element in the iteration.
* `result` is not directly related to the loop head, so its state remains the same.

State: **`numbers` is a list of two or more integers, `result` is the result of `func_1` applied to the first integer in the list `numbers` and the second integer in the list `numbers`, `num` is the third integer in the list `numbers`.**
