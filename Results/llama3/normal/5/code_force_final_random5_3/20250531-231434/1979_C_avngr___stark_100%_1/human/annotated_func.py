#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-zero integers.
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of two non-zero integers a and b, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the absolute value of the product of two non-zero integers, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of two or more integers.
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of two or more integers, `result` is the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to ... applied to the first integer in the list `numbers` and the second integer in the list `numbers`, and the third integer in the list `numbers`, ..., and the last integer in the list `numbers`, `num` is the last integer in the list `numbers`.
    return result
    #The program returns the result of applying func_1 to the first integer in the list 'numbers', then applying func_1 to the result and the second integer in the list 'numbers', and so on, until applying func_1 to the result and the last integer in the list 'numbers'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function applies a given binary function (func_1) cumulatively to the items of a list, from left to right, so as to reduce the list to a single output value. It takes a list of two or more integers as input and returns the result of the cumulative application of func_1 to the integers in the list.
