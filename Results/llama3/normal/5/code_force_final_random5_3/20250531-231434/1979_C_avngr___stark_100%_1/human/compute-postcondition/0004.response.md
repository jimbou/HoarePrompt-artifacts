The code applies the function `func_1` to the current value of `result` and the value of `num`, and assigns the result back to `result`. The value of `numbers` is not affected, so it is still a list of two or more integers. The value of `num` is also not affected, so it is still the third integer in the list `numbers`. The value of `result` is updated to be the result of applying `func_1` to its previous value and the value of `num`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of two or more integers, `result` is the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to the first integer in the list `numbers` and the second integer in the list `numbers`, and the third integer in the list `numbers`, `num` is the third integer in the list `numbers`.**
