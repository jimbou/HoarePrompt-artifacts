Output State: **`numbers` is a list of three or more integers, `result` is the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to the result of `func_1` applied to the first integer in the list `numbers` and the second integer in the list `numbers`, and the third integer in the list `numbers`, and the fourth integer in the list `numbers`, `num` is the fourth integer in the list `numbers`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of numbers remains unchanged, the result is updated by applying the function `func_1` to the previous result and the fourth integer in the list, and the value of `num` remains the same as the fourth integer in the list.
