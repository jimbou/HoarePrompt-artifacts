Reasoning:

The problem requires determining how to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The given program attempts to solve this problem by using two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the absolute value of the product of two non-zero integers, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). This function is used to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

`func_2` applies `func_1` cumulatively to the items of a list, from left to right, to reduce the list to a single output value. In this case, it is used to find the LCM of all the numbers in the list.

The main program uses `func_2` to find the LCM of all the multipliers (`k`) and then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. If the total amount of coins bet is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The program's logic is correct. By finding the LCM of all the multipliers, it ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program also correctly handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

Correctness: **True**
