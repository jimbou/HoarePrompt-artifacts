Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a list of two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= n). `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. However, a new variable `results` is introduced, which is an empty list. This means that `results` is now a part of the program's state, and it is ready to be used to store results from the test cases.
