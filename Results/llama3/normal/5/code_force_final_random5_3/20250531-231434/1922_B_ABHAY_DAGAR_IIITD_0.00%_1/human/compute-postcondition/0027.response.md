The only object in the loop head is variable  cnt, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens dictionary. If the dictionary has at least 2 key-value pairs the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, num_of_lens has at least 1 key-value pair, cnt is the first value in num_of_lens. So for the loop to be executed one more time the dictionary must have at least 2 key-value pairs and cnt is the second value in num_of_lens.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (total_count - cnt)`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, stdin contains 0 inputs.**
