Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, num_list is an empty list, x is undefined, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list, cnt is undefined, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens, and stdin is empty.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `num_list` is empty because all its elements have been processed, `x` is undefined because it is no longer needed, and `num_of_lens` contains the count of each integer from the original `num_list`. The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
