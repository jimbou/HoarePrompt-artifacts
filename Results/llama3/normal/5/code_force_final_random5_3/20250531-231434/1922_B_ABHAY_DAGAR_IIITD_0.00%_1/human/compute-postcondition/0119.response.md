Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, num_list is an empty list, x is undefined, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list, cnt is the last value in num_of_lens, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, and total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains the same as the input value.
* The `num_list` remains an empty list.
* The `x` variable remains undefined.
* The `num_of_lens` dictionary remains the same, with each key being an integer from the original `num_list` and each value being the count of that integer in the original `num_list`.
* The `cnt` variable is updated to the last value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary.
* The `test_cases` list remains the same, with at least one test case.
* The `results` list is updated to contain the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`.
* The `res` variable is updated to the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`.
* The `total_count` variable is updated to the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens`.
