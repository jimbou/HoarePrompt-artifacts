Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the first integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1, the second integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is either increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary or set to 1 if it does not exist, and the third integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is either increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary or set to 1 if it does not exist, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, the value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.**
