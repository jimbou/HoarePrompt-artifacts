Output: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing at least 3 results, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original `num_list` and each value is the count of that integer in the original `num_list`, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, and `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens`, and the third result in the list `results` which is [result] is being printed**
