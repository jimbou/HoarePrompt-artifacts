The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list num_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_list.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, num_list has at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the x is the third integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key and its value is either incremented by 1 if `x` already exists in `num_of_lens`, or set to 1 if `x` does not exist in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` plus 1 if `x` already exists in `num_of_lens`, or the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` if `x` does not exist in `num_of_lens`, stdin contains -1 inputs.**
