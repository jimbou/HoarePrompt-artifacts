Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The program first counts the occurrences of each stick length, then calculates the number of combinations of triplets and pairs of identical integers. The program also correctly handles the case where a stick length occurs less than 3 times, in which case it cannot form a triangle with itself.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the mathematical formulas for combinations. The program also correctly handles the input and output, reading the test cases and printing the results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
