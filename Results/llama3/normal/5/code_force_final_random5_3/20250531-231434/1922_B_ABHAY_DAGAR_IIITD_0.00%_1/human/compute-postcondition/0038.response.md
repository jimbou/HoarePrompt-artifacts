Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is either increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is less than 2.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `total_count`, which is increased by the value of `cnt`, which is the first value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. The value of `res` is also updated based on the value of `cnt`.
