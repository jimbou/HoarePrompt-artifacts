To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least one value, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, we know that `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is the last integer in the list (which is empty), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `num_of_lens` to have at least one value. Let's assume `num_of_lens` has at least one value, and `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is the last integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one value, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**
