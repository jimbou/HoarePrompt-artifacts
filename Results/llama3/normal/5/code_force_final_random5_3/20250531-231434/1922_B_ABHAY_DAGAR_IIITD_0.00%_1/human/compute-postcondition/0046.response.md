Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the input value, num_list is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains -2 inputs, and x is not in num_of_lens***
