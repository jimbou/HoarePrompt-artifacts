Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `total_count`, all divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `cnt` is the second value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary, and `total_count` has been increased by `cnt`.
