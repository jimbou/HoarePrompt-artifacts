Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list that must have at least one value, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 2, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is either `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is 3 or more, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is 2, `total_count` is 0, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been updated to include the additional term `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. The value of `res` is now either the original value if `cnt` is 3 or more, or the new value if `cnt` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
