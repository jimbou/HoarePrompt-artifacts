According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_list. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains 0 inputs. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the x is the first integer in the list.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains 0 inputs, x is the first integer in the list**
