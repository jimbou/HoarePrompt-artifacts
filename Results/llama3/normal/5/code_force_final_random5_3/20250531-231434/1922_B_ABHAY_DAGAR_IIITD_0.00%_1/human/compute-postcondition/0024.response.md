Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The code increases the value of `res` by the product of `cnt` and `cnt-1` divided by 2, and the total count. The value of `cnt` is the first value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary, which is greater than or equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
