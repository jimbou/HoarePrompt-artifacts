Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list that must have at least 2 values, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is either `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is 3 or more, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is 2, and `total_count` is `cnt`. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and then increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` now depends on the value of `cnt`, which is the second value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and then increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
