Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, for each test case in the original `test_cases`, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original `num_list` and each value is the count of that integer in the original `num_list`, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, and `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the `test_cases` list will be empty, and the `results` list will contain the calculated sums for each test case. The `n` variable will hold the last input value, `num_list` will be empty, `x` will be undefined, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary with the counts of each integer in the original `num_list`, `cnt` will be the last value in `num_of_lens`, `res` will be the calculated sum for the last test case, and `total_count` will be the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.
