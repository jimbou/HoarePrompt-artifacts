Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input value, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, x is undefined, cnt is undefined, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, plus res which is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value of 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens` or the value of `x` incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, `cnt` is undefined, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` which is 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens` or the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, and `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens` or a value of 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, `cnt` is undefined, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens` or the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` which is 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, and `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens` or a value of 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, `cnt` is undefined, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens` or the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` which is 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, and `stdin` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
