Postcondition: ***test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the first integer x in num_list is already a key in num_of_lens, then the value of x in num_of_lens is incremented by 1. Otherwise, x is added to num_of_lens with a value of 1.***
