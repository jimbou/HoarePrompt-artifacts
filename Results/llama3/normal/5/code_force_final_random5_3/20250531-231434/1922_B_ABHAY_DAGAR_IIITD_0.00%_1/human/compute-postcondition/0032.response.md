Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In this output state, the value of `total_count` has been updated by adding the value of `cnt` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `res` still depends on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` will be increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `total_count` divided by 2.
