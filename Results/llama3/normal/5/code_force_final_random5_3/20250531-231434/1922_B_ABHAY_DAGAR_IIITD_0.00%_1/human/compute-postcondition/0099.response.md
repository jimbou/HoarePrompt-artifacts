To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one value. Since `cnt` is undefined before the loop, it will take the first value from `num_of_lens` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list that must have at least one value, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, and `stdin` is empty**
