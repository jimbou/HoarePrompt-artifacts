Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list that must have at least 3 values, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is either `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is 3 or more, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is 2, and `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and then increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `cnt` is 2 or more, the state of the variables is updated according to the calculations described above.**
