Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each integer in num_list is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in num_list, res is 0, total_count is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `res` and `total_count`, and assigns them the value 0. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
