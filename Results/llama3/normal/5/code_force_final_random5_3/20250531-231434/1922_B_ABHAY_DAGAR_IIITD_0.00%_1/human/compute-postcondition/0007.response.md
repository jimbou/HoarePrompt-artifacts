Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the first integer in `num_list` as a key and 1 as its value, `x` is the first integer in the list, stdin contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, the code has added a new key-value pair to the `num_of_lens` dictionary, where the key is the first integer in the `num_list` (which is also the value of `x`) and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `test_cases` list still has at least 1 test case, the `results` list is still empty, the `n` variable is still an integer, and the `num_list` list still has at least 1 integer. The `x` variable is still the first integer in the list, and the stdin still contains 0 inputs.
