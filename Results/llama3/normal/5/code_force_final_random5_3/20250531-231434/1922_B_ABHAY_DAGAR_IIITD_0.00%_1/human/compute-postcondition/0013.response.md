The only object in the loop head is variable  x and list num_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_list.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, num_list has at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the x is the third integer in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the first integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1, the second integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is either increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary or set to 1 if it does not exist, and the third integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is either increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary or set to 1 if it does not exist, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
