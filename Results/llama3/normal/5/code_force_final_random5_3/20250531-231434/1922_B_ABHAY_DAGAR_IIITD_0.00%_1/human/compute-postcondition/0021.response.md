Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is 0, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, the integer n, the empty list num_list, and the dictionary num_of_lens remain unchanged. The variable res is increased by the product of the first value in num_of_lens (cnt), cnt minus 1, and cnt minus 2, all divided by 6. The total count and the number of inputs in stdin remain 0. The first value in num_of_lens (cnt) is still greater than or equal to 3.
