Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, `total_count` is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now contains the value of `res`, which is a calculated sum based on the values in `num_of_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains no inputs.
