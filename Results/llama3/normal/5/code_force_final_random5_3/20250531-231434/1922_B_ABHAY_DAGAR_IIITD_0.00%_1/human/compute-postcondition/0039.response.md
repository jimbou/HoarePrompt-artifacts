Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the test cases and results remain unchanged, the number list and dictionary of number lengths are empty, the result is the sum of the products of the counts of each number and the total count, and the total count is the sum of all counts.
