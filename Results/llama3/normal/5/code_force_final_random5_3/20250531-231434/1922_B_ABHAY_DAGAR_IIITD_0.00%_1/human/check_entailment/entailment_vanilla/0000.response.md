Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of n sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each stick length, and then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks based on these counts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and defines a function `func_1` to process each test case.
2. For each test case, the program reads the number of sticks (n) and the list of stick lengths (num_list).
3. It creates a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
4. It initializes two variables: `res` to store the total count of ways to choose 3 sticks, and `total_count` to store the total count of sticks processed so far.
5. The program then iterates over the values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. For each count `cnt`:
	* If `cnt` is 3 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and adds it to `res`.
	* If `cnt` is 2 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using the formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` and adds it to `res`.
	* It increments `total_count` by `cnt`.
6. Finally, the program appends the total count `res` to the `results` list and prints each result.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
