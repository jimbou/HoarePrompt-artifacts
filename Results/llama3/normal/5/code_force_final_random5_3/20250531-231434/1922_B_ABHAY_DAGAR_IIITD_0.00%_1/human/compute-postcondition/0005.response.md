The code `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by 1. Since `x` is the first integer from `num_list` and it is already in `num_of_lens`, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `x` from `num_list` with its value incremented by 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**
