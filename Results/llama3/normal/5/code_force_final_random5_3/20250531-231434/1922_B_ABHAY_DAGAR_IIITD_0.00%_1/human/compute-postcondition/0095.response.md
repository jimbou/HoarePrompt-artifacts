Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value of 1, `cnt` is undefined, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` which is 1, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been updated to 1, and the value of `total_count` has been updated to 1, since `x` is not in `num_of_lens` initially. The values of the other variables remain the same.
