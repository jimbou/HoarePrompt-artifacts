The only objects in the loop head are variables  cnt and num_of_lens, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens.  If the dictionary has at least 2 values the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, num_of_lens has at least one value, cnt is the first value in num_of_lens. So for the loop to be executed one more time the dictionary must have at least 2 values and the cnt is the second value in the dictionary.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is the last integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least 2 values, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, `res` is either 0 or cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 depending on whether cnt is less than 3 or greater than or equal to 3, `total_count` is cnt, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is either cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt or 0 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt depending on whether cnt is less than 3 or greater than or equal to 3.**
