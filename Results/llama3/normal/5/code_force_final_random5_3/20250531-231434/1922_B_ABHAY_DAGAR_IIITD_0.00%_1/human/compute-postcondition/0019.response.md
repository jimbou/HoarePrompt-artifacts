According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens. If num_of_lens has at least 1 key-value pair, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each integer in num_list is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in num_list, res is 0, total_count is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs. So for the loop to be executed  the num_of_lens must have at least 1 key-value pair and cnt is the first value in num_of_lens.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each integer in num_list is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in num_list and must have at least 1 key-value pair, res is 0, total_count is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, cnt is the first value in num_of_lens**
