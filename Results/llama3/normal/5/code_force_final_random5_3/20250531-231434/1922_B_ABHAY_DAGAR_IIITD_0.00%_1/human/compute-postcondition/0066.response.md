Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is the last integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one value, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, `res` is either 0 or cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 depending on whether cnt is less than 3 or greater than or equal to 3, `total_count` is cnt, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If cnt is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is either cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt or 0 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt depending on whether cnt is less than 3 or greater than or equal to 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `total_count` has been incremented by the value of `cnt`. The value of `res` has also been updated based on the new value of `total_count`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
