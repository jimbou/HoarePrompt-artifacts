State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all values, `cnt` is the last value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, plus `res` which is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens`, `stdin` contains 1 input**
