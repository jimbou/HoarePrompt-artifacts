Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least 3 values, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is either `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` or `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
