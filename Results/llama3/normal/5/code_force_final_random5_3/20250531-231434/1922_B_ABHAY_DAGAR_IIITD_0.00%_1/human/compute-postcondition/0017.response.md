Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each integer in num_list is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in num_list, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain each integer from the `num_list` as a key, with its corresponding value being the number of times that integer appears in the `num_list`. The other variables, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
