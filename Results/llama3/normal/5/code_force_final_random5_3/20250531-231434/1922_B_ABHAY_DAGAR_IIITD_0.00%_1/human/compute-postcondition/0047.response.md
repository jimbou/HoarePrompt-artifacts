Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value of 1, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens`, stdin contains -2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num_of_lens` has been updated to include `x` as a key with a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains -2 inputs.
