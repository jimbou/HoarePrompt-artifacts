To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for x in num_list:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_list` has at least 1 integer.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least 2 integers. The first integer in `num_list` has already been processed, so the second integer in `num_list` will be processed in the next iteration.

The state of `x` is also adjusted, as it will take the value of the second integer in `num_list`.

The states of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `stdin` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the first integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
