Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is the last integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one value, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 3, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, `res` is cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6, `total_count` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, where `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
