Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key and its value is incremented by 1, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` plus 1, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

The code increments the value of `x` in the `num_of_lens` dictionary by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `total_count` is updated to be the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` plus 1, since `x` already exists in `num_of_lens`. The `results` and `res` lists are not updated, as they are calculated based on the values in `num_of_lens`, which has not changed significantly. The `test_cases` list and `n` integer remain unchanged. The stdin still contains -1 inputs.
