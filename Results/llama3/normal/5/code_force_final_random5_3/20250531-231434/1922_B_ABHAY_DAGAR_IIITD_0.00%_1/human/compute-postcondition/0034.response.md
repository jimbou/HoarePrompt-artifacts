Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, the empty list of results, the integer n, the empty list of numbers, and the dictionary of number lengths remain unchanged. The total count is still increased by the count of the first value in the number lengths dictionary. The count is still the first value in the number lengths dictionary. The result is increased by the product of the count, the count minus one, and the count minus two, divided by 6, but only if the count is 3 or more.
