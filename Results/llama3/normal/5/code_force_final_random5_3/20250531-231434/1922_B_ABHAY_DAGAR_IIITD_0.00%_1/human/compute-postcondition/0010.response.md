The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is the second integer in `num_list`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin is empty and remains empty. The test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, and x is the second integer in num_list. The num_of_lens is a dictionary where the first integer in num_list is a key with a value of 1 and the second integer in num_list is a key with a value that is increased by 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the first integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1 and the second integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is increased by 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
