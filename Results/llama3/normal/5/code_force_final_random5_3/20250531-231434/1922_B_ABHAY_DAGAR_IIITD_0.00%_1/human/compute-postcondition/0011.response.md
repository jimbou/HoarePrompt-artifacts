The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` updates the value of `num_of_lens` dictionary. The key for this update is `x`, which is the second integer in `num_list`. The value of `num_of_lens` for the key `x` is now 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the first integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1 and `x` is a key with a value of 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
