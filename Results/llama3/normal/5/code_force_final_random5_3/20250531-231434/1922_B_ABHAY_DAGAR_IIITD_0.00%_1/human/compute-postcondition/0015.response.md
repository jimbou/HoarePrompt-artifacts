Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the first integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1, the second integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is either increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary or set to 1 if it does not exist, and the third integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the value of `num_of_lens[x]`, which is now set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
