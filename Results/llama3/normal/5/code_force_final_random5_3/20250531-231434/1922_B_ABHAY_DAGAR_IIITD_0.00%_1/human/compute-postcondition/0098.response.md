Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, num_list is an empty list, x is undefined, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list, cnt is undefined, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, res is 0, total_count is 0, and stdin is empty.**

The code initializes `res` to 0 and `total_count` to 0. Since `res` and `total_count` were previously undefined, they are now assigned these values. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code.
