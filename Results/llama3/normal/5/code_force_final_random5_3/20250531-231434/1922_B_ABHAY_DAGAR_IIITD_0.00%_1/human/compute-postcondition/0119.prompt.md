Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input value, num_list is an empty list, x is undefined, num_of_lens is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list, cnt is undefined, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, res is 0, total_count is 0, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list that must have at least one value, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is either 0 or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is 3 or more, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is 2, and `total_count` is `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list that must have at least 2 values, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is either `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is 3 or more, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is 2, and `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and then increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original num_list and each value is the count of that integer in the original num_list that must have at least 3 values, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is either `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is 3 or more, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is 2, and `total_count` is `cnt + cnt + cnt`. If `cnt` is 3 or more, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and then increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `cnt` is 2 or more, the state of the variables is updated according to the calculations described above.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
