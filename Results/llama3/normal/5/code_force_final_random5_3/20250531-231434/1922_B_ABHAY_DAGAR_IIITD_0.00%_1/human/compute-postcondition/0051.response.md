Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key and its value is 1, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` which is 1, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been updated to 1, indicating that `x` is now a key in the dictionary with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `total_count` is now 1, which is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens`. The `results` and `res` lists still contain the same values, which are the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`.
