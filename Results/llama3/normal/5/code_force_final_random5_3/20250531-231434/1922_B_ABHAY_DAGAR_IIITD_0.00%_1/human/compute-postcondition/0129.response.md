Based on the precondition, the code prints the third result in the list `results`, which is denoted as `[result]`.

Since the exact value of `[result]` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third result in the list `results`.

Output: **[result] (where [result] is the third result in the list results)**
