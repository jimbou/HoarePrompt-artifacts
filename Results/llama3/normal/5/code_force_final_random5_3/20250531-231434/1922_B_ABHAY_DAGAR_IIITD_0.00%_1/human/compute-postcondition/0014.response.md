Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the first integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1, the second integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is either increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary or set to 1 if it does not exist, the third integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is increased by 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been increased by 1, where `x` is the third integer in `num_list`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `num_of_lens` now has the third integer in `num_list` as a key with a value that is increased by 1.
