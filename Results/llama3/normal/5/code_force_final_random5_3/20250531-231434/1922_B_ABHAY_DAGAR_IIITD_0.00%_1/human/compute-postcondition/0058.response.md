Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, num_list is an empty list, x is the last integer in the list, num_of_lens is a dictionary where x is a key and its value is either incremented by 1 if x already exists in num_of_lens, or set to 1 if x does not exist in num_of_lens, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, res is 0, total_count is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The code snippet initializes `res` to 0 and `total_count` to 0. Since `res` and `total_count` were previously defined as the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, and the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens`, respectively, their values are now reset to 0. No other variables are affected by the code.
