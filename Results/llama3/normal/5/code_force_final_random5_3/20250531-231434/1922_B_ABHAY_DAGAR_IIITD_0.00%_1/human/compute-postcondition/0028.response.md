Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is the number of times the integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and is also increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (total_count - cnt)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values except for `res`, which is increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6. Additionally, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is also increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `total_count-cnt` divided by 2.
