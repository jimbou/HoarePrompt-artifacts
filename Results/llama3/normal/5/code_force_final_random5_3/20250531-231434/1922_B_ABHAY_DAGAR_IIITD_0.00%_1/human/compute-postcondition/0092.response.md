Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens` or a value of 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, `cnt` is undefined, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `res` is the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 3`, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt >= 2`, `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens` or the sum of all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` which is 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, and `stdin` is empty.***
