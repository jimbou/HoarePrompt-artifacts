Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program first counts the occurrences of each stick length and stores them in a dictionary. Then, it iterates over the dictionary values (counts of stick lengths) and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length (if the count is 3 or more) and the number of ways to choose 2 sticks with the same length and 1 stick with a different length.

The program correctly handles the cases where the count of a stick length is 3 or more, 2, or 1. It also correctly calculates the total count of sticks and uses it to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 sticks with the same length and 1 stick with a different length.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
