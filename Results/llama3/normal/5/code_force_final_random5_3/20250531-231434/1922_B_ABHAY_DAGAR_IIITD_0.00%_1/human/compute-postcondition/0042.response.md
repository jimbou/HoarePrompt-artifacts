Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, num_list is a list of integers from stdin, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, res is the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 3, plus the sum of cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count for all cnt in num_of_lens where cnt >= 2, total_count is the sum of all cnt in num_of_lens, stdin contains -2 inputs.**

The code block assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, making `n` equal to the input value. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `num_list`, making `num_list` a list of integers. The third line initializes `num_of_lens` as an empty dictionary. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `res`, and `total_count` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Stdin now contains -2 inputs.
