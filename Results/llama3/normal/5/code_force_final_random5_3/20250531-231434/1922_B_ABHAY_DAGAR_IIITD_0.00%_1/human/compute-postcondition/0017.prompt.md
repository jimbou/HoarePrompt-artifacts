Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains 0 inputs
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the first integer x in num_list is already a key in num_of_lens, then the value of x in num_of_lens is incremented by 1. Otherwise, x is added to num_of_lens with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the first integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1, and the second integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is either increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary or set to 1 if it does not exist, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the first integer in `num_list` is a key with a value of 1, the second integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is either increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary or set to 1 if it does not exist, and the third integer in `num_list` is a key with a value that is either increased by 1 if it already exists in the dictionary or set to 1 if it does not exist, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, the value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
