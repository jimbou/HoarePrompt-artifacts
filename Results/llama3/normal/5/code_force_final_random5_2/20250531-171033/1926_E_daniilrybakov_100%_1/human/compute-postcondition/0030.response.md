The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-zero integer divided by 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is 1, n is a non-zero integer divided by 2 and n is greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to (n + 1) // 2, m is 2, x is a non-zero integer equal to (n + 1) // 2**
