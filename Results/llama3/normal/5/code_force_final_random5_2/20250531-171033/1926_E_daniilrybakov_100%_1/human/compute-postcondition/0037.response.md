Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 1, `n` is not equal to 0 and is half of its original value, `k` is an integer, `s` is equal to `n + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
