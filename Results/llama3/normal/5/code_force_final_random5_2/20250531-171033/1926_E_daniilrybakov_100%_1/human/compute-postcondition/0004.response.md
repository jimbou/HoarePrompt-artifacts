Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is not zero and is half of its original value, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1, x is half of the original value of n plus half.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been halved due to the integer division operation `n //= 2`. The value of `x` is half of the original value of `n` plus half, which is calculated by `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
