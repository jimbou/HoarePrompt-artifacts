Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is 0, k is an integer, s is the original value of n, m is a power of 2.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1, the variable `_` remains 0, the variable `n` becomes 0, the variable `k` remains an integer, the variable `s` becomes the original value of `n`, and the variable `m` becomes a power of 2.
