Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1
Code of the loop:
while n:
    x = (n + 1) // 2
    n //= 2
    if s < k and k <= s + x:
        break
    s += x
    m *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is not zero and is half of its original value, k is an integer, s is half of the original value of n plus half plus half of the original value of n plus half, m is 2, x is half of the original value of n plus half. If the current value of s is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of s and x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is half of its original value, k is an integer, s is the original value of n plus half of the original value of n plus half, m is 4, x is half of the original value of n plus half. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is a quarter of its original value and n is greater than 0, k is an integer, s is the original value of n plus half of the original value of n plus half plus a quarter of the original value of n plus half, m is 8, x is a quarter of the original value of n plus half. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
