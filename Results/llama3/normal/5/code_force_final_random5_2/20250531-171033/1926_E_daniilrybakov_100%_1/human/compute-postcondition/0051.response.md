The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is not zero and is half of its original value, so for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0 and its original value must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 2, n is greater than 0 and its original value is greater than 2, k is an integer, m is 2, s is increased by x, x is half of the original value of n plus 0.5**
