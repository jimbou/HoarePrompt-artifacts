The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is half of its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is half of its original value and n must be greater than 0, k is an integer, s is the original value of n plus half of the original value of n plus half, m is 4, x is half of the original value of n plus half**
