Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 5 * 10^4. The stdin still contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9.
