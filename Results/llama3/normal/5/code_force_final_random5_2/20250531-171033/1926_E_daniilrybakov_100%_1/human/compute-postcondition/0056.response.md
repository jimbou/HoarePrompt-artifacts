According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 0 and its original value is greater than 2 but now it is half of its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of n needed to have been greater than 2 and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 2, n is greater than 0 and its original value is greater than 4, k is an integer, m is 4, s is increased by half of the original value of n plus 0.5 plus half of the original value of n plus 0.5, x is half of the original value of n plus 0.5**
