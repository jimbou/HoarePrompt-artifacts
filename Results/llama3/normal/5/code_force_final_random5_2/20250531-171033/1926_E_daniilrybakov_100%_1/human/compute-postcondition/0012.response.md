Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is half of its original value, k is an integer, s is the original value of n, m is 2, x is half of the original value of n plus half. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
