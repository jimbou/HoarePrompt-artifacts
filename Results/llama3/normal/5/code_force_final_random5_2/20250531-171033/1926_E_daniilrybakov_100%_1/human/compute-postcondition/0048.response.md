Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 2, n is not zero and is half of its original value, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1, x is half of the original value of n plus 0.5, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables t, _, n, k, s, m, and x remain unchanged. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
