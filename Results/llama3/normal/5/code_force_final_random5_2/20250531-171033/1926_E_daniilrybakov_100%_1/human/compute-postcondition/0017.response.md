Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is a quarter of its original value and n is greater than 0, k is an integer, s is the original value of n plus half of the original value of n plus half, m is 4, x is a quarter of the original value of n plus half. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
