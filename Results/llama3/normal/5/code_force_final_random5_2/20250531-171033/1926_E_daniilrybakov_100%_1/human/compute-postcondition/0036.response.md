Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is 1, n is not equal to 0 and is half of its original value, k is an integer, s is equal to (n + 1) // 2 + x, m is 4, x is equal to (n + 1) // 2**

The first line assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `x`. Since `x` was originally equal to `(n + 1) // 4`, this line updates the value of `x` to be half of its original value. The second line divides `n` by 2, effectively halving its original value. The value of `s` is still equal to `(n + 1) // 2 + x`, but since `n` has been halved, the value of `s` is also affected. The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged.
