The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 2, n is 0, k is an integer, s is less than or equal to k, m is a power of 2**
