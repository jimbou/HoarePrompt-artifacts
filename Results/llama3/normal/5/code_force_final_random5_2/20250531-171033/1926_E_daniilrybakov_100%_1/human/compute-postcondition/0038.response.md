Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is 1, n is not equal to 0 and is half of its original value, k is an integer, m is 4, x is equal to (n + 1) // 2. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s + x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
