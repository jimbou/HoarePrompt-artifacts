Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 2, n is greater than 0 and its original value is greater than 2 but now it is half of its original value, k is an integer, m is 2, s is increased by half of the original value of n plus 0.5, x is half of the original value of n plus 0.5. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
