Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 2, n is 0, k is an integer, m is a power of 2, s is increased by the original value of n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The value of t remains unchanged, the value of _ remains unchanged, the value of n becomes 0, the value of k remains unchanged, the value of m becomes a power of 2, and the value of s increases by the original value of n.
