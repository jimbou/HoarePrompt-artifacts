To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable, but we'll consider its state as the iteration number for clarity).

Since the loop will execute `t` times, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1. This is because the loop will execute at least once if `t` is 1 or more.

The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, but we can still consider its state as the iteration number. Since the loop will execute `t` times, the iteration number will start from 0 and go up to `t-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0**
