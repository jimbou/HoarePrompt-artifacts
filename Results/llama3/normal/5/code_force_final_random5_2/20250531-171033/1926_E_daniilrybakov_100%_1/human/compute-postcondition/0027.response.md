Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is 1, n is a non-zero integer divided by 2, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1, x is a non-zero integer equal to (n + 1) // 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables t, _, n, k, s, m, and x remain unchanged. The current value of s is still less than k and k is still less than or equal to the sum of s and x. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
