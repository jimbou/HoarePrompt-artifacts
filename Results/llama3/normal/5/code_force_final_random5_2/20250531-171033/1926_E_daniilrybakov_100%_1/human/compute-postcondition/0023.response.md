Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1**

The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m`. The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line sets `s` to 0, and the third line sets `m` to 1. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
