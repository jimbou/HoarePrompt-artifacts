Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t, n is 0, k is an integer, s is the sum of the original values of n, m is a power of 2, and this is printed: (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be greater than or equal to 0 (since it started as a positive integer and was decremented in each iteration), the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, the variable `n` will be 0 (since it was decremented in each iteration and started as a positive integer), the variable `k` will still be an integer (since its value didn't change), the variable `s` will be the sum of the original values of `n` (since it was incremented by the original value of `n` in each iteration), the variable `m` will be a power of 2 (since it was multiplied by 2 in each iteration), and the expression `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` will be printed.
