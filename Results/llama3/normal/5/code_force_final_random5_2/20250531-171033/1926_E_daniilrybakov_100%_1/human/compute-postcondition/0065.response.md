Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. It then calculates and prints the result of a specific mathematical operation for each test case. The operation involves finding the sum of the original values of n, determining a power of 2, and using these values to compute a final result. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
