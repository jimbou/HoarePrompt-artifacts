Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values `t`, `n`, and `k` from the standard input.
2. The program initializes the variables `s` and `m` to 0 and 1, respectively, which are used to keep track of the sum of the original values of `n` and the power of 2, respectively.
3. The program enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0. In each iteration, it calculates the value of `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards in the current iteration.
4. The program checks if `s` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `s + x`. If this condition is true, it means that the `k`-th card is in the current iteration, and the program breaks out of the loop.
5. If the condition is false, the program increments `s` by `x` and multiplies `m` by 2. This effectively moves to the next iteration, where the program considers the next set of cards that are twice an odd number.
6. Once the loop exits, the program calculates the final result using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`. This formula correctly calculates the `k`-th card based on the values of `s` and `m`.
7. The program prints the final result for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of the while loop and the calculation of `x` and `m` are particularly noteworthy, as they efficiently and accurately determine the `k`-th card.

Correctness: **True**
