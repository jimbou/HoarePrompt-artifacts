Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is 1, n is a non-zero integer divided by 2, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1, x is a non-zero integer equal to (n + 1) // 2. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
