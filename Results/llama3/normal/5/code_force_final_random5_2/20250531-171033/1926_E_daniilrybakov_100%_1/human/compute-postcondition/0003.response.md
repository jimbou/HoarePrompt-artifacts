According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer. An integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is not zero.

State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is not zero, k is an integer, s is 0, m is 1**
