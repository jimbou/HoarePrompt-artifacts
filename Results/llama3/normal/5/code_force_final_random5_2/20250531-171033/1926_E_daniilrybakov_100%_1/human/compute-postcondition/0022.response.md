The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `s` is the original value of `n`, `m` is a power of 2**
