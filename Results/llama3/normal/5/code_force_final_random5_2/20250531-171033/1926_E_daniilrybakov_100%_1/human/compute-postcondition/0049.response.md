Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, _ is 2, n is not zero and is half of its original value, k is an integer, m is 1, x is half of the original value of n plus 0.5. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s plus x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
