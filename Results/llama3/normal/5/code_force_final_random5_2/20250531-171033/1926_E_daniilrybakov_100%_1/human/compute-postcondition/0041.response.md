The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`. 

In this expression, `k` is an integer, `s` is less than or equal to `k`, and `m` is a power of 2.

The value of `(k - s)` is the difference between `k` and `s`, which is at least 0 since `s` is less than or equal to `k`. 

Multiplying this difference by 2 gives `2 * (k - s)`, which is at least 0.

Subtracting 1 from this result gives `2 * (k - s) - 1`, which is at least -1.

Finally, multiplying this result by `m` gives `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, which is the final output.

Since `m` is a power of 2, the final output is an integer that is a multiple of a power of 2.

Output: **(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m (where k is an integer, s is less than or equal to k, and m is a power of 2)**
