Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is 1, n is 0, k is an integer, s is less than or equal to k, m is a power of 2.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` becomes 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `s` is less than or equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has found the desired value or has reached the end of the search space. The value of `m` is a power of 2, indicating that it has been multiplied by 2 in each iteration of the loop. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
