Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than or equal to 2, _ is 1, n is a non-zero integer divided by 4 and n is greater than 0, k is an integer, s is equal to (n + 1) // 2, m is 2, x is a non-zero integer equal to (n + 1) // 4. If s is less than k and k is less than or equal to s + x, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
