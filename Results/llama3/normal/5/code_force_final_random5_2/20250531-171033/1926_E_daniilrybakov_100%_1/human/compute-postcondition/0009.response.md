The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is not zero and is half of its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time n currently must not be zero.
State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 1, _ is 0, n is not zero, k is an integer, s is half of the original value of n plus half plus half of the original value of n plus half, m is 2, x is half of the original value of n plus half**
