Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 0 and `innerLoop-1`. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the integer `a`, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, and `a` is an integer. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a`, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, and `a` is an integer. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `a` is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 1 and `innerLoop` (inclusive), `x` is either 1 or 2, `a` is an integer. If `x` is 1, the list `big` has been appended with the value of `a`, while the lists `less` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is 2, the list `less` has been appended with the value of `a`, while the lists `big` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, the list `no` contains one more integer `a` than before, and the corresponding lists (`big`, `less`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 2 and `innerLoop` (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is 1, the list `big` has been appended with the value of `a` twice if `x` equals 1, otherwise the list `big` has been appended with the value of `a` once, while the lists `less` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is 2, the list `less` has been appended with the value of `a` twice if `x` equals 2, otherwise the list `less` has been appended with the value of `a` once, while the lists `big` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, the list `no` contains two more integers `a` than before, and the list `less` contains one more integer `a` than before, and the list `big` remains unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
