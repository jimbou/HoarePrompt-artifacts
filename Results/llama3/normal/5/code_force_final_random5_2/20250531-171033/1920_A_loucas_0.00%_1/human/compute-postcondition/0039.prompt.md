Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer, a is an integer. If x is 1, the list big has been appended with the value of a innerLoop times if x equals 1, otherwise the list big has been appended with the value of a a number of times between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive), while the lists less and no remain unchanged. If x is 2, the list less has been appended with the value of a innerLoop times if x equals 2, otherwise the list less has been appended with the value of a a number of times between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive), while the lists big and no remain unchanged. If x is neither 1 nor 2, the list no contains innerLoop more integers a than before, and the list less contains a number of integers a between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive) more than before, and the list big contains a number of integers a between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive) more than before.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`. If `i` is not in the list `no`, then `num` is equal to the current value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`. `i` is `max(big)+1`. If `i` is not in the list `no`, then `num` is `max(big)+1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)-2`. If `i` is not in the list `no`, then `num` is `max(big)+2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
