To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `iterable` and `loop`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `loop`. If `loop` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `loop` is already an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), we can conclude that the loop will execute.

However, we need to adjust the state of `iterable` to reflect the initial value it will take when the loop starts. Since the loop iterates over the range of `loop`, the initial value of `iterable` will be 0.

State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9)**
