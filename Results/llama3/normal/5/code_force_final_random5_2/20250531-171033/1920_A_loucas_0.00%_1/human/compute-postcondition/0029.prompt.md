You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: loop is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer, a is an integer. If x is 1, the list big has been appended with the value of a innerLoop times if x equals 1, otherwise the list big has been appended with the value of a a number of times between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive), while the lists less and no remain unchanged. If x is 2, the list less has been appended with the value of a innerLoop times if x equals 2, otherwise the list less has been appended with the value of a a number of times between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive), while the lists big and no remain unchanged. If x is neither 1 nor 2, the list no contains innerLoop more integers a than before, and the list less contains a number of integers a between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive) more than before, and the list big contains a number of integers a between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive) more than before.
```
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
