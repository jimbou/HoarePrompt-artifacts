The code prints the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, the value of `num` will be the current value of `i` at the time of printing.

Output: **the current value of i (which is either in the list no or not, and if i is not in no, i is increased by 1)**
