Output State: **`big`, `less` are empty lists, `no` contains the integer `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the list `no` now contains the integer `a`, which was appended to it by the code. The other variables remain unchanged, with `big` and `less` still being empty lists, `num` still being 0, `innerLoop` still being at least 1, `iterable` still being incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` still being 0, `x` still being an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, and `a` still being an integer. The value of `i` is still either in the list `no` or not, and if it's not in `no`, it's still increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is still being printed, and `iterable` is still incremented by 1. The `stdin` is still empty.
