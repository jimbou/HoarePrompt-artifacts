You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 500) — the number of test cases.
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
            if i not in no:
                num = i
                break
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: `big` is a list that must have at least one integer, `less` is a list that must have at least one integer and all integers in `less` are greater than all integers in `big`, `num` is equal to the current value of `i`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop` if `i` is not in `no`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not and is increased by 1 if not in `no` and must be less than `min(less)` for the loop to execute again. If `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged., and the current value of `i` which is equal to `num` is being printed

```

Return Postconditions: `big` is a list that must have at least one integer, `less` is a list that must have at least one integer and all integers in `less` are greater than all integers in `big`, `num` is equal to the current value of `i`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop` if `i` is not in `no`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not and is increased by 1 if not in `no` and must be less than `min(less)` for the loop to execute again. If `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged., and the current value of `i` which is equal to `num` is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
