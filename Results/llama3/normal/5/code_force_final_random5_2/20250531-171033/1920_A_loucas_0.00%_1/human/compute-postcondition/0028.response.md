Output State: **loop is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), iterable is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), iterable2 is equal to innerLoop, x is an integer, a is an integer. If x is 1, the list big has been appended with the value of a innerLoop times if x equals 1, otherwise the list big has been appended with the value of a a number of times between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive), while the lists less and no remain unchanged. If x is 2, the list less has been appended with the value of a innerLoop times if x equals 2, otherwise the list less has been appended with the value of a a number of times between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive), while the lists big and no remain unchanged. If x is neither 1 nor 2, the list no contains innerLoop more integers a than before, and the list less contains a number of integers a between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive) more than before, and the list big contains a number of integers a between 0 and innerLoop (inclusive) more than before.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `iterable2` is now equal to `innerLoop`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` have been updated based on the values of `x` and `a` in each iteration. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
