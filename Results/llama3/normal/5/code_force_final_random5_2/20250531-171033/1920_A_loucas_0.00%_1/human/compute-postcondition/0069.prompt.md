Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: big is an empty list, less is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable is incremented by 1, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` contains the integer `a` and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` contains the integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` contains one element which is the value of `a` and `big` and `less` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` and `a` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` is a list with an additional element `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list with the value of `a` appended to it. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `iterable2` is 2, `x` and `a` are integers, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` is a list with an additional element `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list with the value of `a` appended to it. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
