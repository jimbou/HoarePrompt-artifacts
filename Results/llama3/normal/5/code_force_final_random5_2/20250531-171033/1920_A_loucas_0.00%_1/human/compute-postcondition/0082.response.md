Output: **`big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, `num` is equal to the current value of `i`, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 0, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are integers, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed**
