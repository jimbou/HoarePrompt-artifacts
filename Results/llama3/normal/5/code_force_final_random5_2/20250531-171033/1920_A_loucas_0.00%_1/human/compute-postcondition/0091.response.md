Output State: **`big`, `no` are empty lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer and its current value is 2, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `less` is a list containing `a` and `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `big` and `no` are still empty. The value of `num` is still 0. The value of `innerLoop` is still at least 1. The value of `iterable` is still incremented by `innerLoop`. The value of `iterable2` is still 0. The value of `x` is still 2. The value of `a` is still an integer. The value of `i` is either in the list `no` or not. If `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, and `iterable` is incremented by 1. The list `less` now contains the value of `a`. The `stdin` is still empty.
