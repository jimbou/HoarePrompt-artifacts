Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 2 and `innerLoop` (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, if `x` is 1, the list `big` has been appended with the value of `a` twice, while the lists `less` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is 2, the list `less` has been appended with the value of `a`, while the lists `big` and `no` remain unchanged and the list `big` has one more integer `a` than before. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, the list `no` contains one more integer `a` than before, and the corresponding lists (`big`, `less`) remain unchanged and the list `big` has one more integer `a` than before, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `big` has been appended with the value of `a` regardless of the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The lists `less` and `no` are updated based on the value of `x` as before, but now the list `big` has one more integer `a` than before in all cases.
