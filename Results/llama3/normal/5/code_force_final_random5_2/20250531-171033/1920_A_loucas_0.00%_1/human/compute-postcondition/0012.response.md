Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 0 and `innerLoop-1`. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list containing one integer `a`, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, and `a` is an integer. If `x` is not equal to 2, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `a` is an integer.***
