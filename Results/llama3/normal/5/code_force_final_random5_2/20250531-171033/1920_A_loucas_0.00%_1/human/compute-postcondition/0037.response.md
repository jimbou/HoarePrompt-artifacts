Output State: **big is a list with at least one element, less is a list with at least one element, max(big) is less than min(less)-2, i is max(big)+2, num is max(big)+2.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `num`, and since `i` is `max(big)+2`, `num` becomes `max(big)+2`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are modified by the code.
