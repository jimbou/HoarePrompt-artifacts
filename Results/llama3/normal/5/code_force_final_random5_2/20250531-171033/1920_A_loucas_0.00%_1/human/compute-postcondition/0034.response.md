Output State: **big is a list with at least one element, less is a list with at least one element, max(big) is less than min(less), i is max(big)+1, num is max(big)+1 if max(big)+1 is not in the list no**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `num`. Since `i` is `max(big)+1`, `num` becomes `max(big)+1` if `max(big)+1` is not in the list `no`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
