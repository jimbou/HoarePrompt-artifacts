To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `big` and `less`. The loop will execute if `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`. 

State: **`big` is a list that must have at least one integer, `less` is a list that must have at least one integer and all integers in `less` are greater than all integers in `big`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.**
