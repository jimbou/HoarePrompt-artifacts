Postcondition: ***`big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 0, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are integers, stdin contains no input. The current value of `i` is not in the list `no`.***
