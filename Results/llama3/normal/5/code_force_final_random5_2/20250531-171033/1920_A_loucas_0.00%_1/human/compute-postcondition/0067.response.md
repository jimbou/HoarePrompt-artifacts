Postcondition: ***`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `iterable2` is 2, `x` and `a` are integers, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list with the value of `a` appended to it. Otherwise, if `x` is equal to 1, `big` is a list with an additional element `a`. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.***
