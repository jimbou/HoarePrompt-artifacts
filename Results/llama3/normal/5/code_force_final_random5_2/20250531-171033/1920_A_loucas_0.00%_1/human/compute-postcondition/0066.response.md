Output State: **`big`, `less` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is not checked before appending `a` to the list `no`. As a result, regardless of the value of `x`, the list `no` will always contain the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
