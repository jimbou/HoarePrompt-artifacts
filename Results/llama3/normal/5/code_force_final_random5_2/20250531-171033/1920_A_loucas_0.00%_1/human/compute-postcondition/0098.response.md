Output State: **`big` contains an integer from stdin, `less` is a list, `no` is a list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `big` now contains the integer `a` from stdin, in addition to any other values it may have had before. The other variables remain unchanged, with `less` and `no` still being lists, `num` still being 0, `innerLoop` still being at least 2, `iterable` still being incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` still being 1, `x` and `a` still being integers from stdin, and `i` still being either in the list `no` or not, with its value being printed and incremented by 1 if it's not in `no`. The stdin is still empty. The conditions on `x` and the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are still valid.
