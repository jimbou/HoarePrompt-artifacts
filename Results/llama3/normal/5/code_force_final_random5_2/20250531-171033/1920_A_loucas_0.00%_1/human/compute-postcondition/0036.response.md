To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(max(big), min(less)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:

* `big` is a list with at least one element
* `less` is a list with at least one element
* `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`
* `i` is `max(big)+1`
* If `i` is not in the list `no`, then `num` is `max(big)+1`

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what changes are necessary for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is already `max(big)+1`, the next value of `i` should be `max(big)+2` for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, since `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, we need to ensure that `max(big)+2` is still less than `min(less)` for the loop to execute again. This means that `min(less)` must be greater than `max(big)+2`.

The state of `num` is not directly affected by the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)-2`, `i` is `max(big)+2`. If `i` is not in the list `no`, then `num` is `max(big)+2`.**
