Postcondition: ***`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer not equal to 1, `a` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` contains the integer `a`. Otherwise, `no` contains one element which is the value of `a`.***
