Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`big` is a list that must have at least one integer, `less` is a list that must have at least one integer and all integers in `less` are greater than all integers in `big`, `num` is equal to the current value of `i`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not. If `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, `iterable` is incremented by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `i` is in `no`, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`big` is a list that must have at least one integer, `less` is a list that must have at least one integer and all integers in `less` are greater than all integers in `big`, `num` is equal to the current value of `i`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop` if `i` is not in `no`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not and is increased by 1 if not in `no` and must be less than `min(less)` for the loop to execute again.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`big` is a list that must have at least one integer, `less` is a list that must have at least one integer and all integers in `less` are greater than all integers in `big`, `num` is equal to the current value of `i`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop` if `i` is not in `no`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not and is increased by 1 if not in `no` and must be less than `min(less)` for the loop to execute again. If `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
