Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. The issue lies in the way it handles the constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x). The program only checks if the first integer i in the range [max(big), min(less)] is not in the list no, and if it is not, it assigns this value to num and breaks the loop. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider all possible integers in the range that satisfy the constraints.

A correct approach would be to count the number of integers in the range [max(big), min(less)] that are not in the list no. This can be done by iterating over the range and checking each integer individually.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:

    2
    
    1 5
    
    2 10
    
    3 6

In this case, the program will output 6, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 4, because the integers 5, 7, 8, and 9 satisfy all the constraints.
