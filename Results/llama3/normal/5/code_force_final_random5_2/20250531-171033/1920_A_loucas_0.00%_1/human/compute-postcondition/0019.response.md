Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 1 and `innerLoop` (inclusive), `x` is either 1 or 2, `a` is an integer. If `x` is 2, the list `less` has been appended with the value of `a`, while the lists `big` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is not 2, the list `no` contains one more integer `a` than before, and the corresponding lists (`big`, `less`) remain unchanged.***
