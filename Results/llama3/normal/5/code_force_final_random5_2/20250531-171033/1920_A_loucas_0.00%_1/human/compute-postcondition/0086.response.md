Output State: **`big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty**

The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of two integers from the input to the variables `x` and `a`, respectively. The input is a single line containing two space-separated integers. After the code is executed, the stdin is empty because the input has been consumed. The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.
