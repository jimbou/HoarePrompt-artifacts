Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `loop` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each starting with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).
