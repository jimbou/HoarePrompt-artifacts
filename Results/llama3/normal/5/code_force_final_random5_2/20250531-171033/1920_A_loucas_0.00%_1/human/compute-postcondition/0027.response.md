Postcondition: ***`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 2 and `innerLoop` (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is 1, the list `big` has been appended with the value of `a` twice if `x` equals 1, otherwise the list `big` has been appended with the value of `a` once, while the lists `less` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is 2, the list `less` has been appended with the value of `a` twice if `x` equals 2, otherwise the list `less` has been appended with the value of `a` once, while the lists `big` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, the list `no` contains two more integers `a` than before, and the list `less` contains one more integer `a` than before, and the list `big` remains unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.***
