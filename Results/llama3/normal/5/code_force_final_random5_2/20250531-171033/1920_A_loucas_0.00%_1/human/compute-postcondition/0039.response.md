Output State: **`big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)-loop+1`. If `i` is not in the list `no`, then `num` is `max(big)+loop-1`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `big` and `less` will still have at least one element each, and the maximum value in `big` will be less than the minimum value in `less` minus the number of iterations of the loop plus one. If the current value of `i` is not in the list `no`, then the value of `num` will be the maximum value in `big` plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one.
