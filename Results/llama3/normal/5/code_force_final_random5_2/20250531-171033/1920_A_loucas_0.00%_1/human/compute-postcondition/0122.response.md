The code prints the current value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i`. The value of `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and is increased by 1 if not in `no`. The loop will execute again only if `i` is less than `min(less)`. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `num`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current value of `i` which is equal to `num`.

Output: **the current value of i (which is equal to num)**
