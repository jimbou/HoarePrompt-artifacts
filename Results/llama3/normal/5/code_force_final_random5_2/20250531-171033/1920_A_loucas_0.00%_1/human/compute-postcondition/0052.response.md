The code `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. The initial state of `no` is an empty list, so after the code is executed, `no` will contain one element, which is the value of `a`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` contains one element which is the value of `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `a` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**
