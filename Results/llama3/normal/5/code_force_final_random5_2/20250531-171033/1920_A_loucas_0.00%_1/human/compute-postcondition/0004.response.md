Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 0 and `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `less`, `big`, `no`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains multiple test cases minus two because two integers have been read from the input. The variables `x` and `a` are assigned integer values from the input.
