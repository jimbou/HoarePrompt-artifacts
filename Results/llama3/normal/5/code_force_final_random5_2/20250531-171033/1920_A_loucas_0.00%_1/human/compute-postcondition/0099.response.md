Output State: **`big` is a list, `less` is a list containing `a` which is an integer from stdin, `no` is a list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `less` now contains the integer `a` which was read from stdin. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `big` still contains an integer from stdin if `x` is 1, and the list `no` still contains `a` if `x` is not 1 or 2. The value of `i` is still either in the list `no` or not, and if it's not in `no`, it's still increased by 1 and its value is still being printed as `num`. The variables `innerLoop`, `iterable`, and `iterable2` also remain unchanged.
