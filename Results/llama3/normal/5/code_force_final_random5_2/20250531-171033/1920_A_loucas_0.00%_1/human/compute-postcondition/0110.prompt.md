Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: big is an empty list, less is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable is incremented by innerLoop, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x and a are integers, i is either in the list no or not, and if i is not in no, i is increased by 1, and the value of num which is equal to the current value of i is being printed, iterable is incremented by 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
