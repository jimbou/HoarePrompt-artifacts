Output State: **`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `a` are updated to be the integers from the input. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from the input. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.
