Postcondition: ***`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a`.***
