Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 2 and `innerLoop` (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, if `x` is 1, the list `big` has been appended with the value of `a`, while the lists `less` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is 2, the list `less` has been appended with the value of `a`, while the lists `big` and `no` remain unchanged. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, the list `no` contains one more integer `a` than before, and the corresponding lists (`big`, `less`) remain unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `num`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `a` are updated to the input values. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` is appended with `a`, if `x` is 2, `less` is appended with `a`, and if `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is appended with `a`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four.
