Postcondition: ***`big` is a list that must have at least one integer, `less` is a list that must have at least one integer and all integers in `less` are greater than all integers in `big`, `num` is equal to the current value of `i`, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop` if `i` is not in `no`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not and is increased by 1 if not in `no` and must be less than `min(less)` for the loop to execute again. If `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.***
