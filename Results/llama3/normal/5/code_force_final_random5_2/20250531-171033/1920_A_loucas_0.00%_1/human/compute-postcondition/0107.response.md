Output State: **`big`, `less` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.**

In this output state, the code has appended `a` to the list `no`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` determines whether `big` or `less` contains an integer from stdin, and if `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. The value of `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed. The value of `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop` and also by 1. The value of `iterable2` is 2. The value of `num` is 0. The value of `innerLoop` is at least 3.
