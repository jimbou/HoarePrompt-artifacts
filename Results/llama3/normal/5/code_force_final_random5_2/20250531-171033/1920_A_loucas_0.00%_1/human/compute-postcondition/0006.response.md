Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 0 and `innerLoop-1`, `x` is 1, `a` is an integer, and `big` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `loop`, `iterable`, `stdin`, `less`, `no`, `num`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, and `x` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `a` is still an integer. The list `big` now contains the integer `a`.
