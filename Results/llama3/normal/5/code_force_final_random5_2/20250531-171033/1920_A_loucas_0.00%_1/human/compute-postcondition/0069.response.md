Output State: **`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 0, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are integers, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` is a list with all elements `a` appended to it. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list with all values of `a` appended to it. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing all values of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain all the elements `a` appended to them based on the value of `x` for each iteration. The variable `num` remains 0, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 0, and `iterable` is incremented by the value of `innerLoop`. The variable `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`, and `x` and `a` will be integers. The stdin will contain no input.
