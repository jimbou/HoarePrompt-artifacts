Postcondition: ***`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` and `a` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list with the value of `a` appended to it. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.***
