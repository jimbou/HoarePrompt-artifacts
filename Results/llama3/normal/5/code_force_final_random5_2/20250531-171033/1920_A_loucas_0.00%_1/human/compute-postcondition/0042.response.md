To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for iterable in range(loop):`. The only variable in the loop head is `iterable`, and the loop will execute as long as `iterable` is within the range defined by `loop`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `iterable` is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that it has reached the end of the range defined by `loop`. To execute the loop again, `iterable` must be incremented by 1.

The other variables mentioned in the state (`big`, `less`, `max(big)`, `min(less)`, `i`, `no`, and `num`) are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment `iterable` by 1.

State: **`big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element, `max(big)` is less than `min(less)-loop+1`, `iterable` is incremented by 1**
