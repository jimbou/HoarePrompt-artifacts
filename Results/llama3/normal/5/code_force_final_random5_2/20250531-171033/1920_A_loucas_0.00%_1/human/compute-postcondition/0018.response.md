Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 1 and `innerLoop` (inclusive), `x` is either 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, and the list `no` contains one more integer `a` than before, and the corresponding lists (`big`, `less`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `loop`, `iterable`, `stdin`, `num`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain the same as before. The list `no` now contains one more integer `a` than before, while the lists `big` and `less` remain unchanged.
