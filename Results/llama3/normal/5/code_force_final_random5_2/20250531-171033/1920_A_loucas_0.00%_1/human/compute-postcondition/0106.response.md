Output State: **`big` is a list, `less` contains an integer from stdin, `no` is a list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer from stdin, `a` is an integer from stdin, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `less` now contains the integer `a` from stdin. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `big` and `no` are still lists. The value of `num` is still 0. The value of `innerLoop` is still at least 3. The value of `iterable` is still incremented by `innerLoop`. The value of `iterable2` is still 2. The value of `x` is still an integer from stdin. The value of `a` is still an integer from stdin. The value of `i` is still either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is still increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is still being printed, `iterable` is still incremented by 1. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers. The conditions for `big`, `less`, and `no` based on the value of `x` are still valid.
