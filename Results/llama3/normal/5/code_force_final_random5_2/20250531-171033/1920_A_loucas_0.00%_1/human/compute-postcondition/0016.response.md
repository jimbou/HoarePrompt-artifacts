Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 1 and `innerLoop` (inclusive), `x` is either 1 or 2, `a` is an integer, `big` is a list with one more element which is `a`, and the lists (`less`, `no`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for the list `big`, which now has one additional element, which is the value of `a`.
