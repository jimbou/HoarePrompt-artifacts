Output State: **`big` is a list, `less` is a list, `no` is a list containing `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `x` is 1, `big` contains an integer from stdin. If `x` is 2, `less` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` contains `a` which is an integer from stdin.**

In this output state, the list `no` now contains the integer `a` that was previously read from stdin. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `x`, `big`, `less`, and `no` are still valid.
