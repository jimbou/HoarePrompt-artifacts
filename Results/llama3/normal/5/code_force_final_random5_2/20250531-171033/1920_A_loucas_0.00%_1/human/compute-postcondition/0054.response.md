Postcondition: ***`big`, `less`, `no` are lists, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` contains the integer `a` and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` contains the integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `no` contains one element which is the value of `a` and `big` and `less` are empty lists.***
