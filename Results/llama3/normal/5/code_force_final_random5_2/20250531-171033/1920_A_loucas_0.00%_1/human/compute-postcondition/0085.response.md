To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `iterable2` and `innerLoop`. The loop will execute if `innerLoop` is at least 1.

State: **`big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable` is incremented by `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is 0, `x` and `a` are integers, `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if `i` is not in `no`, `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `num` which is equal to the current value of `i` is being printed, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer**
