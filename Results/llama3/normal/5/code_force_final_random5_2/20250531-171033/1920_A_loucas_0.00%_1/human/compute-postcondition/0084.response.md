Output State: **big is an empty list, less is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable is incremented by innerLoop, iterable2 is innerLoop - 1, x and a are integers, i is either in the list no or not, and if i is not in no, i is increased by 1, and the value of num which is equal to the current value of i is being printed, iterable is incremented by 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer**

In this output state, all the lists (`big`, `less`, `no`) are empty because they were reassigned to empty lists in the code. The value of `num` is 0 because it was reassigned to 0 in the code. The value of `innerLoop` is an integer because it was assigned the value of an integer input from stdin. The values of `iterable` and `iterable2` are updated based on the value of `innerLoop`. The values of `x` and `a` are still integers because their values were not modified in the code. The value of `i` is either in the list `no` or not, and if it is not in `no`, it is increased by 1, and the value of `num` (which is equal to the current value of `i`) is being printed. The value of `iterable` is incremented by 1. Stdin contains 1 input: an integer, which was used to assign the value of `innerLoop`.
