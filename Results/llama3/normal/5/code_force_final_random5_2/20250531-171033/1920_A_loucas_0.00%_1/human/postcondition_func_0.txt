This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It categorizes the constraints based on the value of a (1, 2, or 3) and finds the smallest integer k that satisfies all the constraints. The function prints the value of k for each test case.
