Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `iterable` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing one integer `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `iterable2` is an integer between 0 and `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `a` is an integer.**

The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`, which was initially empty. The other variables remain unchanged.
