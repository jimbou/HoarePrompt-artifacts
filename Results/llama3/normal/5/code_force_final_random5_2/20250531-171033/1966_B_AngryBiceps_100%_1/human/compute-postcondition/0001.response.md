The code reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `m`, and then initializes four variables: `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row`. 

The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, this line consumes two integers from the input. The second line initializes an empty list `a`. The third and fourth lines initialize two empty strings `first_row` and `last_row`.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains multiple test cases with two fewer integers**
