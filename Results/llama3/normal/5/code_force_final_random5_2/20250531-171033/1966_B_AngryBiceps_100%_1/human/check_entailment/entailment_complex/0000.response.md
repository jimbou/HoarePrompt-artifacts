Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program checks two conditions:

1. If the first and last rows are the same but have different colors, it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
2. If the first and last columns are the same but have different colors, it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the grid has only one row or one column, and it correctly handles the case where the grid is already filled with the same color.

The program also correctly reads the input from standard input and processes all test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
