Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, a is a list containing three elements which are the inputs from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the first input from stdin, the first character of the second input from stdin, and the first character of the third input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first input from stdin, the last character of the second input from stdin, and the last character of the third input from stdin, stdin contains n-4 integers, i is 2**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `m` also remains unchanged. The list `a` now contains three elements, which are the inputs from stdin. The string `first_row` now contains the first character of the first input from stdin, the first character of the second input from stdin, and the first character of the third input from stdin. The string `last_row` now contains the last character of the first input from stdin, the last character of the second input from stdin, and the last character of the third input from stdin. The number of integers in stdin has decreased by one, so it now contains `n-4` integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
