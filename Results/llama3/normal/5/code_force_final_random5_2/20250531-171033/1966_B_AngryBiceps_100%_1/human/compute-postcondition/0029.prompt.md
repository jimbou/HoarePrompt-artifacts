Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains multiple test cases with n-1 fewer integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing one element which is the input from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the input from stdin, stdin contains n-2 fewer integers, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing two elements which are the inputs from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the first input from stdin and the first character of the second input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first input from stdin and the last character of the second input from stdin, stdin contains n-3 integers, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, a is a list containing three elements which are the inputs from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the first input from stdin, the first character of the second input from stdin, and the first character of the third input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first input from stdin, the last character of the second input from stdin, and the last character of the third input from stdin, stdin contains n-4 integers, i is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
