Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of rows and columns in the grid, and the initial colors of the squares. It then checks if the first and last rows, and the first and last columns, are all the same color. If they are not, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

The program's logic is correct because if the first and last rows, and the first and last columns, are all the same color, then it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing operations on the subrectangles between the first and last rows, and the first and last columns. On the other hand, if the first and last rows, or the first and last columns, are not all the same color, then it's impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color, because there's no way to change the color of the squares in the subrectangles between the first and last rows, or the first and last columns.

Correctness: **True**
