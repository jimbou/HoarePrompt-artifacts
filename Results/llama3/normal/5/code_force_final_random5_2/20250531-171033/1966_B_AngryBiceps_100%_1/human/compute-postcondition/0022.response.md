Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains multiple test cases with n-1 fewer integers.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `m` is updated to an integer. The list `a` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `first_row` and `last_row` are initialized as empty strings. Stdin now contains multiple test cases with `n-1` fewer integers, as one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function.
