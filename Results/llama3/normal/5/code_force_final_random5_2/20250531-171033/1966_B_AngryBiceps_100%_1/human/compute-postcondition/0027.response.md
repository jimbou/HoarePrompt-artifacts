The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, a is a list containing two elements which are the inputs from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the first input from stdin and the first character of the second input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of the first input from stdin and the last character of the second input from stdin, stdin contains n-3 integers, i is 2**
