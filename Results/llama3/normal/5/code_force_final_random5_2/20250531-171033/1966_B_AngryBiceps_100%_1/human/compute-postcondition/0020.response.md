Postcondition: **n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of each string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of each string in a, stdin contains multiple test cases with n fewer integers. If the first and last strings in a have all characters the same but are not the same, 'NO' is printed. If the first and last strings in a have all characters the same and are the same, or if either the first or last string in a contains more than one unique character, then if the first_row contains only one unique character, the last_row contains only one unique character, and the first_row is not equal to last_row, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
