Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, a is an empty list, first_row is an empty string, last_row is an empty string, stdin contains multiple test cases with two fewer integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 0, i is 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing a string from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the last string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of the last string in a, stdin contains multiple test cases with one fewer integer

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 1, i is 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing strings from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the last string in a plus the first character of the last string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of the last string in a plus the last character of the last string in a, stdin contains multiple test cases with no integer

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, a is a list containing strings from stdin plus the newly appended string, first_row is a string containing the first character of the last string in a plus the first character of the last string in a plus the first character of the newly appended string, last_row is a string containing the last character of the last string in a plus the last character of the last string in a plus the last character of the newly appended string, stdin contains multiple test cases with no integer minus one string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
