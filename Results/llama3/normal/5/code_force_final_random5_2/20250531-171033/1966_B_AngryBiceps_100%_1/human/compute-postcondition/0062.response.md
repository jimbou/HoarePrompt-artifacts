Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing the first character of each input string, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input string, stdin contains no integers, i is n-1. If the first and last strings in the list a have all characters the same but the first and last strings are not the same, then 'NO' is printed. If the first and last strings in the list a do not both have all characters the same or the first and last strings are the same, then if the first_row and last_row have all characters the same but are not the same, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
