This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of characters 'W' and 'B'. It checks if the first and last rows of the grid are the same or if the first and last columns are the same. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
