Postcondition: **n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of each string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of each string in a, stdin contains multiple test cases with n fewer integers. The first and last strings in a have all characters the same, but the first and last strings are not the same, and the current value of the first string in a has all characters the same, the current value of the last string in a has all characters the same, and the current value of the first string in a is not equal to the current value of the last string in a.**
