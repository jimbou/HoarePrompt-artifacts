Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It checks if the first and last rows of the grid are the same or if the first and last columns are the same. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. This is a correct solution to the problem because if the first and last rows or columns are the same, it means that there is no way to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

Correctness: **True**
