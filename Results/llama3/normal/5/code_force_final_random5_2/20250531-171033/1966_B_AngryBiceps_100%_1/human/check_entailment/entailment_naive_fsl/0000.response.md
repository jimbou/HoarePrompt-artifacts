Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the following input:

3 3
BBB
BBB
WWW

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program does not correctly handle the case where the first and last rows (or columns) are the same color, but the rest of the grid is a different color.

The program only checks if the first and last rows (or columns) are the same color, but it does not check if the rest of the grid is also the same color. It also does not check if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

To fix this, the program should check all rows and columns, not just the first and last ones. It should also check if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.
