Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing n elements which are the inputs from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of each input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input from stdin, stdin contains no integers, i is n-1. If the first and last elements of a contain only one unique character and the first and last elements of a are not the same, and both the first and last rows have only one unique character each, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either the first and last elements of a contain more than one unique character, or the first and last elements of a are the same, or both the first and last elements of a contain more than one unique character, and 'YES' is printed.***
