To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the `input()` function.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()` function returning a value that can be converted to an integer. If the input is not a valid integer, the loop will not execute.

At the start of the loop, stdin contains multiple test cases. For the loop to execute, the input must be a valid integer.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, input() must return a valid integer**
