Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first and last rows of the grid are the same color, and if the first and last columns of the grid are the same color. If both conditions are met, but the colors are different, it prints "NO", indicating that it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows for any number of operations, not just operations that involve the first and last rows or columns. Therefore, the program's logic is too restrictive and does not cover all possible cases.

For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are different colors, but there is a row in the middle that is the same color as the first row. In this case, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing an operation that involves the middle row and the first row. However, the program would incorrectly print "NO" in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
