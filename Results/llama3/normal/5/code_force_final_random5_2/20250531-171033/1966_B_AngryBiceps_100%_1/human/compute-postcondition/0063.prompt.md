Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers n and m, followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of each string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of each string in a, stdin contains multiple test cases with n fewer integers. If the first and last strings in a have all characters the same but are not the same, 'NO' is printed. If the first and last strings in a have all characters the same and are the same, or if either the first or last string in a contains more than one unique character, then if the first_row contains only one unique character, the last_row contains only one unique character, and the first_row is not equal to last_row, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, m is an integer, a is a list containing n elements which are the inputs from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of each input from stdin, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input from stdin, stdin contains no integers, i is n-1. If the first and last elements of a are single-character strings and are not equal, and all characters in the first and last elements of a are the same, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either the first and last elements of a contain more than one unique character, or the first and last elements of a are the same, or both the first and last rows have more than one unique character each, and 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing the first character of each input string, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input string, stdin contains no integers, i is n-1. If the first and last strings in the list a have all characters the same but the first and last strings are not the same, then 'NO' is printed. If the first and last strings in the list a do not both have all characters the same or the first and last strings are the same, then if the first_row and last_row have all characters the same but are not the same, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
