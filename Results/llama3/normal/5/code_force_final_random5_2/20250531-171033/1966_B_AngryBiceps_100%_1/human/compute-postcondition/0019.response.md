Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of each string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of each string in a, stdin contains multiple test cases with n fewer integers. Additionally, either the first string in a contains more than one unique character, the last string in a contains more than one unique character, or the first string in a is equal to the last string in a. If the first_row contains only one unique character, the last_row contains only one unique character, and the first_row is not equal to last_row, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the first_row contains more than one unique character, the last_row contains more than one unique character, or the first_row is equal to the last_row, then 'YES' is printed.***
