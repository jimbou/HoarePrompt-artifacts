Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, m is an integer, a is a list containing strings from stdin plus the newly appended string, first_row is a string containing the first character of the last string in a plus the first character of the last string in a plus the first character of the newly appended string, last_row is a string containing the last character of the last string in a plus the last character of the last string in a plus the last character of the newly appended string, stdin contains multiple test cases with no integer minus one string.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 2, and the value of `i` remains 2. The value of `m` remains an integer. The list `a` now contains all the strings from stdin plus the newly appended string. The string `first_row` now contains the first character of the last string in `a` plus the first character of the last string in `a` plus the first character of the newly appended string. The string `last_row` now contains the last character of the last string in `a` plus the last character of the last string in `a` plus the last character of the newly appended string. Stdin now contains multiple test cases with no integer minus one string.
