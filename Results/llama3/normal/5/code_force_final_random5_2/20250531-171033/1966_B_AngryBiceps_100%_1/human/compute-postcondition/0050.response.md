Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing n strings, first_row is a string containing the first character of each input string, last_row is a string containing the last character of each input string, stdin contains no integers, i is n-1**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of n will be the same as it was initially, the value of m will also remain unchanged, the list a will contain n strings, each of which is an input string. The string first_row will contain the first character of each input string, and the string last_row will contain the last character of each input string. The variable i will have the value n-1, which is the index of the last iteration of the loop.
