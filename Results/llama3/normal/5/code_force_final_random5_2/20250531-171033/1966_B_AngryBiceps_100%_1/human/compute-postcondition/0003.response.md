Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing a string from stdin, first_row is a string containing the first character of the last string in a, last_row is a string containing the last character of the last string in a, stdin contains multiple test cases with one fewer integer**

The code snippet reads a string from stdin and appends it to the list `a`. The first character of this string is appended to `first_row`, and the last character is appended to `last_row`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by one.
