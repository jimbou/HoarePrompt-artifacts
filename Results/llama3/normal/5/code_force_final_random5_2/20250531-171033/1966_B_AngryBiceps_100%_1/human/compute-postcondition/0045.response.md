Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, a is a list containing one string, first_row is a string containing the first character of the input string, last_row is a string containing the last character of the input string, stdin contains no integers, i is 0**

The code block executes as follows:

1. `a.append(input())`: This line reads a string from stdin and appends it to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, it now contains one string.

2. `first_row += a[-1][0]`: This line adds the first character of the last string in `a` (which is the only string in `a`) to `first_row`. Since `first_row` was initially an empty string, it now contains the first character of the input string.

3. `last_row += a[-1][-1]`: This line adds the last character of the last string in `a` (which is the only string in `a`) to `last_row`. Since `last_row` was initially an empty string, it now contains the last character of the input string.

The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` are not affected by the code block, so they remain the same. The state of `stdin` is also unchanged, as it still contains no integers.
