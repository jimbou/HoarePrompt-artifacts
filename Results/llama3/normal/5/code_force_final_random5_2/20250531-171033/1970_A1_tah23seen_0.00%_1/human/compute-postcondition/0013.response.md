Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 2, and `d` is a dictionary with four key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or -1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis, 2 maps to the value of `d[1]` plus 1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or `d[1] - 1` if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis, and 3 maps to `d[2] - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `d[3]` is calculated by subtracting 1 from the value of `d[2]`, which is either `d[1] + 1` if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or `d[1] - 1` if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis. The other variables remain unchanged.
