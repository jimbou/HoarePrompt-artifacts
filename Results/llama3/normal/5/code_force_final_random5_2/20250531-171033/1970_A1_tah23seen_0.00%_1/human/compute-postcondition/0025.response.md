Functionality: **Reorders a balanced parentheses sequence to prioritize opening parentheses with lower indices.**

The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and returns a reordered string `ans` where all characters from `s` are rearranged based on their indices in a dictionary `d`. The dictionary `d` maps each index in the string to the balance of opening and closing parentheses up to that index. The function then sorts the dictionary by value in ascending order and constructs the output string `ans` by concatenating characters from `s` in the order of their indices in the sorted dictionary. The resulting string `ans` contains all characters from the original string `s`, but with opening parentheses having lower indices prioritized.
