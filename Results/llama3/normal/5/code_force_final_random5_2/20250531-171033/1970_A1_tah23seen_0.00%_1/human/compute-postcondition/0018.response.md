Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is the first value in the dictionary `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs sorted by value in ascending order, where each key is an index from 0 to `n-1`, and each value is the balance of opening and closing parentheses up to that index.**

In this output state, the only change is that `ans` now contains the first character of `s`, which is either "(" or ")". The other variables remain unchanged.
