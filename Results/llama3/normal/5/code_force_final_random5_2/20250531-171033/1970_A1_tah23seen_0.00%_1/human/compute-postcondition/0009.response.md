Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 1, and `d` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or -1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis, and 2 maps to `d[1] - 1` which is either 0 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or -2 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis.**

In natural language, the output state is that the string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged, the answer string `ans` is still empty, the index `i` is still 1, and the dictionary `d` now has an additional key-value pair where the key is 2 and the value is one less than the value of `d[1]`, which depends on whether the character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening or closing parenthesis.
