Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, i is n-1, and d is a dictionary with n key-value pairs sorted by value in ascending order, where each key is an index from 0 to n-1, and each value is the balance of opening and closing parentheses up to that index.
Code of the loop:
for i, j in d:
    ans += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is the first value in the dictionary `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs sorted by value in ascending order, where each key is an index from 0 to `n-1`, and each value is the balance of opening and closing parentheses up to that index.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first two characters of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is the second value in the dictionary `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs sorted by value in ascending order, where each key is an index from 0 to `n-1`, and each value is the balance of opening and closing parentheses up to that index.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first three characters of `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is the third value in the dictionary `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs sorted by value in ascending order, where each key is an index from 0 to `n-1`, and each value is the balance of opening and closing parentheses up to that index.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
