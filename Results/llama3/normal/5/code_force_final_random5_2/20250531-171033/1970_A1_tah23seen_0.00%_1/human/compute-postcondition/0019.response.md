To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `j`, and `d`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is the first value in the dictionary `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs sorted by value in ascending order.

For the loop to execute again, the dictionary `d` must have at least one more key-value pair. Since `i` is the key in the dictionary, it must be incremented by 1. Similarly, `j` must be the next value in the dictionary.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the first character of `s`, `i` is 1, `j` is the second value in the dictionary `d`, and `d` is a dictionary with `n` key-value pairs sorted by value in ascending order, where each key is an index from 0 to `n-1`, and each value is the balance of opening and closing parentheses up to that index.**
