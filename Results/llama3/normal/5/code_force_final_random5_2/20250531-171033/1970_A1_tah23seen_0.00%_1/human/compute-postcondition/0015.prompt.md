Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, d is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 0 maps to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == '(':
        d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
    else:
        d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, and `d` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to either 1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or -1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 1, and `d` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or -1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis, and 2 maps to the value of `d[1]` plus 1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or `d[1] - 1` if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 2, and `d` is a dictionary with four key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or -1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis, 2 maps to the value of `d[1]` plus 1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or `d[1] - 1` if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis, and 3 maps to the value of `d[2]` plus 1 if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis, or `d[2] - 1` if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
