To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):`, which means that `y` is the loop variable, and its value is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `x - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from `x - 1` and ends at 1).

Since `y` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `x - 2`.

The other variables, `x` and `max_val`, are not affected by the loop head, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1, `y` is `x - 2`.**
