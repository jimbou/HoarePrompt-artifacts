To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue executing.

The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate over the values of `y` from `x - 1` down to `1` (exclusive) in steps of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `max_val` is 1, and `y` is `x - 2`.

For the loop to execute again, the value of `y` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order. Therefore, the new value of `y` will be `x - 3`.

The value of `x` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop head.

The value of `max_val` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `max_val` is 1, and `y` is `x - 3`.**
