Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `max_val` is 1, and `y` is `x - 3`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, the program returns an integer between -1 and 997 (inclusive) if 2 times `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise it returns None. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, no action is taken.***
