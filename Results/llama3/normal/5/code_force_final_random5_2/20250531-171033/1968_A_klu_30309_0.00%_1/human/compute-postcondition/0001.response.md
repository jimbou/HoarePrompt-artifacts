The only variables in the loop head are variables  y and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `y`. If x is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 and max_val is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 1 and y is now x - 1. 
State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`**
