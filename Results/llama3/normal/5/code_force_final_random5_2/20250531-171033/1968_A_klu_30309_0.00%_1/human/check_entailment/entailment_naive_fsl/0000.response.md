Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(x)` correctly finds an integer `y` such that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximum possible.

The function iterates over the range from `x - 1` to `1` in reverse order, checking if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`, it returns `y` immediately. This is because in this case, `gcd(x, y) + y` is guaranteed to be maximum possible, as `gcd(x, y)` is equal to `y` and `y` is the largest possible value.

If no such `y` is found, the function returns the maximum value of `y` that was found during the iteration, which is stored in the variable `max_val`. This is because `gcd(x, y) + y` is still maximum possible for this value of `y`, even if `2 * y` is not greater than or equal to `x`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `x` is a prime number or `x` is a power of 2. Therefore, the program is correct and the answer is **True**.
