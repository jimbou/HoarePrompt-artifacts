Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, max_val is 1
Code of the loop:
for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
    if x % y == 0:
        if 2 * y >= x:
            return y
        max_val = y


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`. If `y` is a divisor of `x` and 2 times `y` is strictly less than `x`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `max_val` is 1, and `y` is `x - 2`. If `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program returns `y`, which is 2 less than `x`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `max_val` is 1, and `y` is `x - 3`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, the program returns an integer between -1 and 997 (inclusive) if 2 times `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise it returns None. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
