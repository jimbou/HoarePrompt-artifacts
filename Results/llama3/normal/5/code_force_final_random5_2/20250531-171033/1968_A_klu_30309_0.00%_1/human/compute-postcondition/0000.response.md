Output State: **x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, max_val is 1**

The code snippet provided does not modify the value of `x` in any way. The variable `max_val` is introduced and assigned the value of 1. The rest of the code is a docstring, which is a comment and does not affect the state of the program. Therefore, the final state includes the original range of `x` and the newly introduced `max_val` with its assigned value.
