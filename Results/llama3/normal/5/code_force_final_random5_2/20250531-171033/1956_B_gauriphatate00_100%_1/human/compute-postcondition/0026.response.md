Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`. If the current value of `num` exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a`, then `max_score` is 2 if `num` is not 2 or `num` is 2 but its value in `count_a` is not 2, otherwise `max_score` is 3. If `num` does not exist as a key in the dictionary `count_a`, then `max_score` remains 1.***
