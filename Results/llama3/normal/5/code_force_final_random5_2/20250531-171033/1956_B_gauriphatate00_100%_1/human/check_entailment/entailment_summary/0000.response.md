Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem requires finding the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally in a card game. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer in the list, and then calculates the maximum score by counting the number of integers that appear exactly twice.

The program's logic is sound because it correctly identifies the integers that appear twice in the list, which corresponds to the cards that can be played to score points. The program also correctly calculates the maximum score by counting the number of such integers.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, counting the occurrences of each integer and calculating the maximum score.

Correctness: **True**
