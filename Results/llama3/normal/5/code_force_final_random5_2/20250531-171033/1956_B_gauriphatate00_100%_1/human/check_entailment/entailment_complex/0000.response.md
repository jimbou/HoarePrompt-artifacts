Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally in the card game.

The program first counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` using a dictionary `count_a`. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and checks if each integer appears exactly twice in the list `a`. If it does, it increments the `max_score` by 1.

The program correctly assumes that the input list `a` contains integers from 1 to `n` and that each integer appears at most twice in the list. It also correctly calculates the maximum score by counting the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list.

The program does not modify the input list and returns the correct maximum score.

Correctness: **True**
