Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`, `num` is 2, `max_score` is 2 if `num` is not 2 or `num` is 2 but its value in `count_a` is not 2, otherwise `max_score` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `max_score` has been updated by adding 1 to its previous value. Since `num` is 2, the condition for `max_score` being 3 is not met, so it remains 2 if `num` is not 2 or `num` is 2 but its value in `count_a` is not 2, otherwise it becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
