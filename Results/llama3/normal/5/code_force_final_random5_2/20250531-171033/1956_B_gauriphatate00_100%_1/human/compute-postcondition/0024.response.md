Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`. If the current value of `num` is 2 and it exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a` with a value of 2, then `max_score` is 3. Otherwise, `max_score` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `max_score` has been incremented by 1. If `num` is 2 and it exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a` with a value of 2, then `max_score` is now 3. Otherwise, `max_score` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
