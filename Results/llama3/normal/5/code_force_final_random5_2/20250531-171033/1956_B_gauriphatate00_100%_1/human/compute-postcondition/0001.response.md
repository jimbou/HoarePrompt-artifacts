The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is an empty dictionary. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 1 integer, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is an empty dictionary, num is the first integer in the list**
