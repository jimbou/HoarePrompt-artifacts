Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 1 integer, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `num`, the first integer in the list `a`, and the value of `num` in the dictionary `count_a` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num` in the dictionary `count_a` is increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains integers from 1 to `n`, and each integer appears at most 2 times. The dictionary `count_a` still contains at least one key-value pair, but the value of `num` has been incremented by 1.
