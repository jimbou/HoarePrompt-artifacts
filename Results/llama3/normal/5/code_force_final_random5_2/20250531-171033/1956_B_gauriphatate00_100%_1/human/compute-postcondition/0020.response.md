Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`, `max_score` is 1, the current value of `num` is 1 and it exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a`, and the current value of `count_a[num]` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` still contains integers from 1 to `n` with each integer appearing at most twice. The value of `n` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The dictionary `count_a` still keeps track of the count of each integer in the list `a`. The `max_score` has been incremented by 1 and is now 1. The value of `num` is still 1, and it is a key in the dictionary `count_a` with a value of 2.
