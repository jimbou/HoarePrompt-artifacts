Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`, `max_score` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` and the dictionary `count_a` remain unchanged, but the variable `max_score` has been updated to reflect the total number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.
