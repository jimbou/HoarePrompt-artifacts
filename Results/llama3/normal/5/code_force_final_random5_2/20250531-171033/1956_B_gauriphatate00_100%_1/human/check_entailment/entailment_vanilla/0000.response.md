Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game, given the cards in their hand and the optimal strategy of their opponent, Nene.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes the list of cards `a` and the number of cards `n` as input. It first creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each card number in the hand. Then, it iterates over the range of possible card numbers (from 1 to `n`) and checks if the count of each number is 2. If it is, it increments the `max_score` by 1.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* Since each card number appears exactly twice in the deck, if a player has two cards with the same number, they can guarantee a point by playing one of them after Nene has played the other.
* If a player has only one card with a certain number, they cannot guarantee a point, as Nene may not have played the other card with that number.
* Therefore, the maximum score a player can achieve is equal to the number of card numbers that appear twice in their hand.

The program correctly implements this logic and returns the maximum score.

Correctness: **True**
