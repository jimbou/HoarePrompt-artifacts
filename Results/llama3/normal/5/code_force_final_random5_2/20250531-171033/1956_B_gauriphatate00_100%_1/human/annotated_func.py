    #The program returns the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the list a.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers from 1 to n and a positive integer n as input, and returns the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the list. The function does not modify the input list. It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list, and then calculates the maximum score by counting the number of integers that appear exactly twice. The function returns this maximum score.
