Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`, `max_score` is 0, the current value of `num` is 1 and it exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a`.**
