The only objects in the loop head are variables  num and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num and n. If num is less than n + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num is 1, n is a positive integer that must be at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time num must be 2 and n must be at least 2.
State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`. If the current value of `num` is 2 and it exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a` with a value of 2, then `max_score` is 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1.**
