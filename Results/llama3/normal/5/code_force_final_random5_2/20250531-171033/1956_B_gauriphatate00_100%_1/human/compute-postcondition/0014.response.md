Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 3 integers, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list `a` is a key, if the key already exists in the dictionary, its value is increased by 1, otherwise the key is added to the dictionary with a value of 1, `num` is the next integer in the list `a`. If `num` is already in `count_a`, its value in `count_a` is increased by 1. If `num` is not in `count_a`, `num` is added to `count_a` with a value of 1.**
