Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`, `max_score` is 0.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `max_score` and assigned it the value 0. The other variables `a`, `n`, and `count_a` remain unchanged, maintaining their initial properties.
