To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`, `max_score` is 0, `num` is 1**
