Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`, `max_score` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in range(1, n + 1):
    if num in count_a:
        if count_a[num] == 2:
            max_score += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 1, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`. If the current value of `num` is 1 and it exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a` with a value of 2, then `max_score` is 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`. If the current value of `num` exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a`, then `max_score` is 2 if `num` is not 2 or `num` is 2 but its value in `count_a` is not 2, otherwise `max_score` is 3. If `num` does not exist as a key in the dictionary `count_a`, then `max_score` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least `n` integers, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each integer from 1 to `n` is a key, and the value of each key is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`, `num` is 2. If `num` exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a` and its value is 2, then `max_score` is 4. If `num` exists as a key in the dictionary `count_a` but its value is not 2, then `max_score` is 2. If `num` does not exist as a key in the dictionary `count_a`, then `max_score` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
