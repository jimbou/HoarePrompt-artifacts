Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the first integer in the list `a` is a key, if the key already exists in the dictionary, its value is increased by 1, otherwise the key is added to the dictionary with a value of 1, `num` is the next integer in the list `a`, and the value of `num` in `count_a` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` remains the same, the value of `n` remains the same, the list `a` still contains integers from 1 to `n` with each integer appearing at most twice, the dictionary `count_a` still has the first integer of `a` as a key, but the value of this key is now increased by 1, and `num` is still the next integer in the list `a`.
