Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each number in the input list `a` and then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` to find the numbers that appear twice in the list. For each such number, it increments the `max_score` by 1, which represents the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the cases where the input list `a` contains numbers that appear only once, numbers that appear twice, and numbers that do not appear at all. The program also handles the case where the input list `a` is empty, in which case the `max_score` will be 0.

The program's logic is sound, and it does not contain any errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
