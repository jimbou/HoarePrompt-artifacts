Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus two, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

The code adds the value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to both lists `b` and `s`. The state of all other variables remains unchanged.
