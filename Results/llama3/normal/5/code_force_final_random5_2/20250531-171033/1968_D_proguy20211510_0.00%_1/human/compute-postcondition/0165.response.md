The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list s.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, all the other variables remain the same. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the index is 0.
