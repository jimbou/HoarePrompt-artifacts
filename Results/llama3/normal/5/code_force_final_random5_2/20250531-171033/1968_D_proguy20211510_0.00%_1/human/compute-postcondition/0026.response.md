Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is an integer, b is a list with an additional element maxa, s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

The code appends the maximum value in list `a` (i.e., `maxa`) to list `b`. Since `founds` is True, list `s` also gets an additional element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
