Postcondition: ***YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is False, foundb is True, i is an integer. If foundb is True, then b is a list with an additional element maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, foundb is False, pb is updated to p[pb - 1], and b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1].***
