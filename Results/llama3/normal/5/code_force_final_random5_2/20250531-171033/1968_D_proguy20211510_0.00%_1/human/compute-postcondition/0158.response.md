Output State: **If foundb is True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If foundb is False, then if both foundb and founds are True, b and s are lists with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, if both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 2] and s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. pb is now equal to p[pb - 1].**

In this output state, the code has appended maxa to the list s, regardless of the values of foundb and founds. The other variables remain unchanged, with b still having an additional element equal to maxa or a[pb - 1] or a[pb - 2] depending on the conditions, and pb still being equal to p[pb - 1].
