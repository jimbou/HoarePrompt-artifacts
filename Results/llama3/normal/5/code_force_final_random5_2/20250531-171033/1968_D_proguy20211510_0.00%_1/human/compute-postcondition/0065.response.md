Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus two, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element maxa, founds is True, s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element a[ps - 1].**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The values of YES, NO, MOD, alpha, and _ remain unchanged. The values of n, k, pb, ps, p, a, and maxa also remain unchanged. The value of foundb is True, and the list b has an additional element equal to maxa. The value of founds is True, and the list s has two additional elements: one equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and the other equal to a[ps - 1].
