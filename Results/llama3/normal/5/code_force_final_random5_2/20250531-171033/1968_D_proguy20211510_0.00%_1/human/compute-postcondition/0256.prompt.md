Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is False, foundb is False, i is len(s) - 1, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times that must have at least len(s) elements, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., preb[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., pres[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is an empty list, s is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is a boolean value, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, i is 0, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times that must have at least len(s) elements, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., preb[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., pres[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], If foundb is True, then b has been appended with maxa. If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa. Otherwise, pb is p[pb - 1] and a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa. If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa and s has been appended with a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, ps is p[ps - 1] and a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa. If founds is True, then s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and has been appended with maxa.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If founds is True, then s has been appended with maxa. Otherwise, if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa and s has been appended with a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, ps is p[ps - 1] and a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *If founds is True, then s has been appended with maxa twice and b has been appended with maxa. If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa and s has been appended with a[ps - 1] and maxa and b has been appended with maxa. Otherwise, ps is p[ps - 1] and a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa, i is 1, and k must be greater than 1 and b has been appended with maxa. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, found is True, founds is True, s has been appended with maxa twice, b has been appended with (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1] and maxa, i is 1, and k is greater than 1. Otherwise, if foundb and founds are True, then found is True, s has been appended with maxa twice, b has been appended with (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1] and maxa, i is 1, and k is greater than 1. Otherwise, if founds is True, then s has been appended with maxa twice. If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa and s has been appended with a[ps - 1] and maxa. Otherwise, ps is p[ps - 1] and a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa, i is 1, and k must be greater than 1, and pb is p[pb - 1]. If founds is False, then if a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, s has been appended with a[ps - 1], and b has been appended with maxa. Otherwise, ps is p[ps - 1] or p[p[ps - 1]] and a[ps - 1] or a[p[ps - 1]] is not equal to maxa, i is 1, and k must be greater than 1, and b has been appended with maxa. If foundb is True, then found is True, s has been appended with maxa, and b has been appended with maxa and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If founds is True, then s has been appended with maxa. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, found is True, founds is True, s has been appended with maxa, b has been appended with (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1], i is 1, and k is greater than 1. If foundb and founds are True, then found is True, s has been appended with maxa, b has been appended with (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1], i is 1, and k is greater than 1. Otherwise, if founds is True, then s has been appended with maxa. If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa and s has been appended with a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, ps is p[ps - 1] or p[p[ps - 1]] and a[ps - 1] or a[p[ps - 1]] is not equal to maxa, i is 1, and k must be greater than 1, and pb is p[pb - 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
