Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, founds is False, foundb is False, i is len(s) - 1, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, rem is k - len(s), maxs is 0, maxb is 0.**

The code snippet has the following effects on the program state:

1. The first line, `b, s = [], []`, resets the values of `b` and `s` to empty lists. This means that any previous values stored in these lists are discarded.

2. The second line, `founds, foundb = False, False`, resets the boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` to `False`. This means that any previous values of these variables are discarded.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet. The final state of the program is as described above.
