Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, founds is False, foundb is False, i is len(s) - 1, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, rem is k - len(s), maxs is 0, maxb is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, i is an integer, preb is a list, pres is a list, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list, ptss is a list, rem is k - len(s) - 1, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer. If foundb is True, then b is a list that includes maxa. Otherwise, if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list containing the value of a[pb - 1]. Otherwise, pb is updated to the value of p[pb - 1] and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1]. If founds is True, then s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then s is a list that includes maxa. Otherwise, ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1] and s is a list that includes a[ps - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than i + 1, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, i is an integer that is increased by 1, preb is a list, pres is a list, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list, ptss is a list, rem is k - len(s) - 1, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer. If foundb is True, then b is a list that includes maxa and an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list containing the value of a[pb - 1] and an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, pb is updated to the value of p[pb - 1] and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and an additional element equal to maxa. If founds is True, then s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. If a[ps - 1] equals maxa, then s is a list that includes maxa. Otherwise, ps is updated to the value of p[ps - 1] and s is a list that includes a[ps - 1]. If both foundb and founds are True, then b and s are lists with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If founds is True, then if foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If foundb is False, then if both foundb and founds are True, b and s are lists with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, if both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 2] and s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. pb is now equal to p[pb - 1]. If founds is False, then if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, if foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if founds is True. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and no changes are made to s. If foundb is False, then if both foundb and founds are True, b and s are lists with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1]. Otherwise, if both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 2] and s remains unchanged. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s remains unchanged. pb is now equal to p[pb - 1]. If a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa, then s is a list with an additional element equal to a[ps - 1] and ps is now equal to p[ps - 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
