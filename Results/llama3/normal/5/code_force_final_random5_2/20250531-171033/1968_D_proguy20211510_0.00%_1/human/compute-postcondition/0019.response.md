Postcondition: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a. If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa and a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa but a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa, or if a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa but a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If neither a[pb - 1] nor a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the execution of the code continues normally.**
