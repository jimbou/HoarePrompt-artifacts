The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and pres, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pres`. If pres has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, so it needs to be adjusted to pres has at least 1 element and i is now 0.
