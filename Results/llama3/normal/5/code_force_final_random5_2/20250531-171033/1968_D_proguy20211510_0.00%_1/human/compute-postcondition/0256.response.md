Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is k - 1, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times that must have at least len(s) elements, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., preb[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., pres[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The loop will continue to execute until it has executed k times.
- If foundb is True, then b will be appended with (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.
- If founds is True, then s will be appended with (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.
- If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, then foundb will be set to True and b will be appended with a[pb - 1].
- If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then founds will be set to True and s will be appended with a[ps - 1].
- If foundb and founds are True, then the loop will break.
- The values of the other variables that are not affected by the loop head and body will remain unchanged.
