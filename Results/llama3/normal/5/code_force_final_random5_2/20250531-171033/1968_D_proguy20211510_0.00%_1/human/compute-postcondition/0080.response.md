To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pres`. The loop will execute if `pres` has at least one element. Since `i` is already set to `len(s) - 1`, we need to adjust `pres` to have at least one element.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 0, preb is a list containing the values of sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[len(s) - 1], pres is a list containing the values of ss + s[0], ss + s[1], ..., ss + s[len(s) - 1] that must have at least 1 element, sb is the value of sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1], ss is the value of ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1], ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list**
