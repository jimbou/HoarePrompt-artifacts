Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than i + 1, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, i is an integer that is increased by 1, preb is a list, pres is a list, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list, ptss is a list, rem is k - len(s) - 1, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, foundb is True, b is a list that includes maxa.**

The code block modifies the values of `foundb` and `b`. The first line sets `foundb` to `True`. The second line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since `foundb` is now `True`, `b` is a list that includes `maxa`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
