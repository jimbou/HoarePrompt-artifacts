Output State: **If foundb is True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to a[ps - 1]. If foundb is False, then if both foundb and founds are True, b and s are lists with an additional element equal to a[ps - 1]. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1]. Otherwise, if both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 2] and s remains unchanged. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s remains unchanged. pb is now equal to p[pb - 1].**

In this final state, the value of `founds` is set to `True`, and an additional element `a[ps - 1]` is appended to the list `s`. The state of `b` and `pb` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify these variables. The state of `foundb` is not explicitly modified, so its value remains the same as in the initial state.
