Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, founds is False, foundb is False.**

The code initializes two empty lists `b` and `s`, and two boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` to False. These new variables do not affect the existing variables in the initial state. The values of `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, and `maxa` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
