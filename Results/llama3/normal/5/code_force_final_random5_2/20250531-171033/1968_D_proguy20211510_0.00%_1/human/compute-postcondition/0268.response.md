To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pres`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pres`. If `pres` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `pres` has at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `pres` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 1, `preb` is a list containing `sb` + `b[i]`, `sb` + 2 * `b[i]`, ..., `sb` + `len(s)` * `b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `sb` is `len(s)` * `b[i]`, `ss` is `len(s)` * `s[i]`, `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[i]` + `rem` * `b[i]`, `ptss` is a list containing `pres[i]` + `rem` * `s[i]`, `rem` is `k` - (`i` + 1), `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `b` is a list containing (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `b` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `s` is a list containing (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`, `s` must have at least `len(s)` elements**
