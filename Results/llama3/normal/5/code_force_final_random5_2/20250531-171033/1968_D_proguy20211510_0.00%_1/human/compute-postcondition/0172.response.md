Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is True, foundb is True, i is len(s) - 1, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list, rem is 0, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer**

The code has reset the values of `ptsb` and `ptss` to empty lists, while all other variables remain unchanged.
