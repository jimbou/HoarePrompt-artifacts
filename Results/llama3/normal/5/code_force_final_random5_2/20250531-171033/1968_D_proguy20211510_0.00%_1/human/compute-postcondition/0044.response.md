Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus one, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is an integer plus one, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

The code block modifies the lists `b` and `s` by appending the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to each of them. The value of `i` is not changed, but since `founds` is True, `b` and `s` already had an additional element `maxa` before the code execution. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
