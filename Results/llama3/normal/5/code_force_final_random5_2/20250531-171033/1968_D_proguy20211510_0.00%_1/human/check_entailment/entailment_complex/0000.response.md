Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the input values. The program first checks if the maximum value in the array 'a' is the same for both Bodya and Sasha's starting positions. If it is, the program prints 'Draw'. If not, the program simulates the game for both Bodya and Sasha, keeping track of their scores at each turn. The program then calculates the maximum possible score for both Bodya and Sasha by considering all possible moves. Finally, the program compares the maximum possible scores and prints the winner.

The program correctly handles the case where the maximum value in the array 'a' is the same for both Bodya and Sasha's starting positions, and it correctly simulates the game for both players. The program also correctly calculates the maximum possible scores for both players and determines the winner based on these scores.

Correctness: **True**
