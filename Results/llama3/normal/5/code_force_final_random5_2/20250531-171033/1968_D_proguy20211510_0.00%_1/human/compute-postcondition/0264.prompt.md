Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is k - 1, preb is an empty list, pres is an empty list, sb is 0, ss is 0, ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are 0 + rem * b[i], 0 + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., 0 + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are 0 + rem * s[i], 0 + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., 0 + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 0, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i], sb is b[i], ss is s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are 0 + rem * b[i], 0 + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., 0 + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are 0 + rem * s[i], 0 + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., 0 + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], s must have at least 1 element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 1, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], sb + 2 * b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i], ss + 2 * s[i], sb is 2 * b[i], ss is 2 * s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are 0 + rem * b[i], 0 + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., 0 + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are 0 + rem * s[i], 0 + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., 0 + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], s must have at least 2 elements.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
