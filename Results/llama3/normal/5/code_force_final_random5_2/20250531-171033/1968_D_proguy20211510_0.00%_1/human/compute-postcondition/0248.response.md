Output State: **If foundb and founds are True, then found is True, s has been appended with maxa, b has been appended with (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1], i is 1, and k is greater than 1. Otherwise, if founds is True, then s has been appended with maxa. If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa and s has been appended with a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, ps is p[ps - 1] and a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa, i is 1, and k must be greater than 1, and pb is p[pb - 1].**

The code appends the value of a[pb - 1] to b and updates pb to be p[pb - 1]. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
