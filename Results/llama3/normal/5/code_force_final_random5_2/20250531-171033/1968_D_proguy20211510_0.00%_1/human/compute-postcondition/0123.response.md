Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is an integer, preb is a list, pres is a list, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list, ptss is a list, rem is k - len(s) - 1, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, b is a list containing the value of a[pb - 1], s is unchanged.**

The code modifies the value of `foundb` to True and appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. The value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, so `b` now contains the maximum value in `a`. No other variables are affected.
