The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `k` is an integer that must be greater than `i` plus one. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than `i` plus one.
State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus two, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a. If founds is True, then if foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is unchanged. Otherwise, pb is updated to p[pb - 1]. If founds is False, then if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element maxa, and founds is True, s is a list with an additional element a[ps - 1] and an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, ps is updated to p[ps - 1]. If foundb is True, then b is a list with an additional element maxa. If both foundb and founds are True, then s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element a[ps - 1]. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is unchanged. Otherwise, pb is updated to p[pb - 1]. If both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
