Output State: **foundb is True, then found is True, s has been appended with maxa and a[ps - 1], b has been appended with maxa and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, i is 1, and k is greater than 1. Otherwise, if founds is True, then s has been appended with maxa and a[ps - 1] and b has been appended with maxa. If a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[ps - 1] is equal to maxa. Otherwise, ps is p[ps - 1] and a[ps - 1] is not equal to maxa, i is 1, and k must be greater than 1 and b has been appended with maxa. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, found is True, founds is True, s has been appended with maxa and a[ps - 1], b has been appended with (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1], i is 1, and k is greater than 1.

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

- If `foundb` is True, then `found` is True, `s` has been appended with `maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`, `b` has been appended with `maxa` and `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 1.
- If `foundb` is False, then if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `found` is True, `s` has been appended with `maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`, `b` has been appended with `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 1.
- If `foundb` and `founds` are True, then `found` is True, `s` has been appended with `maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`, `b` has been appended with `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 1.
- If `founds` is True, then `s` has been appended with `maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`.
- If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then the current value of `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`. Otherwise, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1, and `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`.
