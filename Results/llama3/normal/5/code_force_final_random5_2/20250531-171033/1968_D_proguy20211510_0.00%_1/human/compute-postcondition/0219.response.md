Postcondition: ***YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True if a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, otherwise foundb is False, i is 0, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times that must have at least len(s) elements, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., preb[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., pres[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa, then the current value of a[pb - 1] is equal to maxa. Otherwise, pb is p[pb - 1] and a[pb - 1] is not equal to maxa.***
