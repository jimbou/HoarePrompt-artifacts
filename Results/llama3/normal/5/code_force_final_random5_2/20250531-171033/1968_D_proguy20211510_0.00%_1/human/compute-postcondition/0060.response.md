Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus two, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, foundb is True, founds is True, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

In this output state, the variables YES, NO, MOD, alpha, _, n, k, pb, ps, p, a, and maxa retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code. The variable foundb is set to True, and the list b is appended with the element at index pb - 1 from list a. Since foundb is True, the list b now includes an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. The state of the variable s remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
