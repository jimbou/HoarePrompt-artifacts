Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is True, foundb is True, i is len(s) - 1, preb is a list containing the values of sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[len(s) - 1], pres is a list containing the values of ss + s[0], ss + s[1], ..., ss + s[len(s) - 1], sb is the value of sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1], ss is the value of ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1], ptsb is an empty list, ptss is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pres)):
    rem = k - (i + 1)
    ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
    ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 0, preb is a list containing the values of sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[len(s) - 1], pres is a list containing the values of ss + s[0], ss + s[1], ..., ss + s[len(s) - 1] that must have at least 1 element, sb is the value of sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1], ss is the value of ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1], ptsb is a list containing the value of preb[0] + rem * b[0], ptss is a list containing the value of pres[0] + rem * s[0]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 1, preb is a list containing the values of sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[len(s) - 1], pres is a list containing the values of ss + s[0], ss + s[1], ..., ss + s[len(s) - 1] that must have at least 2 elements, sb is the value of sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1], ss is the value of ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1], ptsb is a list containing the values of preb[0] + rem * b[0], preb[1] + rem * b[1], rem is k - (i + 1), ptss is a list containing the values of pres[0] + rem * s[0], pres[1] + rem * s[1]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 2, preb is a list containing the values of sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[len(s) - 1], pres is a list containing the values of ss + s[0], ss + s[1], ..., ss + s[len(s) - 1] that must have at least 3 elements, sb is the value of sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1], ss is the value of ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1], ptsb is a list containing the values of preb[0] + rem * b[0], preb[1] + rem * b[1], ..., preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing the values of pres[0] + rem * s[0], pres[1] + rem * s[1], ..., pres[i] + rem * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
