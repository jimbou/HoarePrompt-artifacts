Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus one, pb is p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a. If both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `pb` has been updated to `p[pb - 1]`, and if `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `b` has an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
