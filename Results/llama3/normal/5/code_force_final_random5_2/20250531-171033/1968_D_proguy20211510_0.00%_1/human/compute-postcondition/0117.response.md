Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, founds is True, foundb is True, i is an integer, preb is a list, pres is a list, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list, ptss is a list, rem is k - len(s) - 1, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer.**

The code adds a new element to both list `b` and list `s`, which is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. This means that the length of both `b` and `s` increases by 1. The value of `rem` is updated to `k - len(s) - 1` because the length of `s` has increased by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
