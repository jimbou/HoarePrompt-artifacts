The code modifies the values of `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`. The first line updates the value of `rem` to be `k - (i + 1)`, which is one less than its original value. The second and third lines append new elements to the `ptsb` and `ptss` lists, respectively. The new elements are calculated by adding the product of `rem` and the corresponding element from `b` or `s` to the `i-th` element of `preb` or `pres`. The resulting lists `ptsb` and `ptss` now contain three elements each. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
