Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus one, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list with an additional element maxa. If both foundb and founds are True, then s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables retain their initial values except for list b, which now has an additional element equal to the maximum value in list a. If both foundb and founds are True, list s also has an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) times the maximum value in list a.
