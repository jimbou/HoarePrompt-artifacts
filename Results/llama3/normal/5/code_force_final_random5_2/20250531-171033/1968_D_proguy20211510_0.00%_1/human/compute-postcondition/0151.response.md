Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than i + 1, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, i is an integer that is increased by 1, preb is a list, pres is a list, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list, ptss is a list, rem is k - len(s) - 1, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, b is a list that includes maxa and an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

The code appends `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to both lists `b` and `s`, and then breaks out of the loop. The values of `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `rem`, `maxs`, and `maxb` remain unchanged. The only changes are to lists `b` and `s`, which both have an additional element equal to `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.
