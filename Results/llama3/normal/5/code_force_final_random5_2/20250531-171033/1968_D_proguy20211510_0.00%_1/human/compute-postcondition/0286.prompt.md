Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S (1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9). The second line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n). The third line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxa = max(a)
    if a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Draw')
        continue
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        print('Bodya')
        continue
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Sasha')
        continue
    b, s = [], []
    founds, foundb = False, False
    for i in range(k):
        if foundb and founds:
            b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            break
        if foundb:
            b.append(maxa)
        elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
            foundb = True
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
        else:
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
        if founds:
            s.append(maxa)
        elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
            founds = True
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
        else:
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
    preb, pres = [], []
    sb, ss = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        preb.append(sb + b[i])
        sb += b[i]
        pres.append(ss + s[i])
        ss += s[i]
    ptsb, ptss = [], []
    for i in range(len(pres)):
        rem = k - (i + 1)
        ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
        ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])
    maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)
    if maxs > maxb:
        print('Sasha')
    elif maxs < maxb:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is True, foundb is True, i is len(s) - 1, preb is a list containing the values of sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[len(s) - 1], pres is a list containing the values of ss + s[0], ss + s[1], ..., ss + s[len(s) - 1], sb is the value of sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1], ss is the value of ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1], ptsb is a list containing the values of preb[0] + rem * b[0], preb[1] + rem * b[1], ..., preb[len(s) - 1] + rem * b[len(s) - 1], ptss is a list containing the values of pres[0] + rem * s[0], pres[1] + rem * s[1], ..., pres[len(s) - 1] + rem * s[len(s) - 1], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb. If maxs is greater than maxb, 'Sasha' is printed. If maxs is less than maxb, 'Bodya' is printed. If maxs is greater than or equal to maxb, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is True, foundb is True, i is len(s) - 1, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times that must have at least len(s) elements, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., preb[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., pres[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb. If maxs is greater than maxb, 'Sasha' is printed. If maxs is less than maxb, 'Bodya' is printed. If maxs is equal to maxb, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is len(s) - 1, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], sb + 2 * b[i], ..., sb + len(s) * b[i], pres is a list containing at least len(s) elements, sb is len(s) * b[i], ss is len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i] for all i in range(len(s)), ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i] for all i in range(len(s)), rem is 0, maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], s must have at least len(s) elements. If maxs is greater than maxb, 'Sasha' is printed. If maxs is less than maxb, 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
