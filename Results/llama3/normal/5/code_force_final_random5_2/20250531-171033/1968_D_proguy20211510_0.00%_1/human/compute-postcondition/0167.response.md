According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `s`. If `i` is less than the length of `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `s` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `s` must have at least 2 elements.
