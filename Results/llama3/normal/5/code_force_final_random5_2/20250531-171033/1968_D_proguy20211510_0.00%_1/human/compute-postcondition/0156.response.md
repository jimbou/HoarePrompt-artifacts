Postcondition: ***If both foundb and founds are True, then b and s are lists with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1]. Otherwise, if both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 2] and s remains unchanged. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s remains unchanged. pb is now equal to p[pb - 1].***
