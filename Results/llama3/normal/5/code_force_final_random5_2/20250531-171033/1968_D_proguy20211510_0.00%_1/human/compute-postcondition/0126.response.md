Postcondition: ***YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, i is an integer, preb is a list, pres is a list, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list, ptss is a list, rem is k - len(s) - 1, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer, b and s are unchanged. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list containing the value of a[pb - 1]. Otherwise, pb is updated to the value of p[pb - 1] and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1].***
