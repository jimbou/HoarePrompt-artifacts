Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 0, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times that must have at least len(s) elements, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are preb[i] + rem * b[i], preb[i] + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., preb[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are pres[i] + rem * s[i], pres[i] + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., pres[i] + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, b has been appended with maxa.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `b` has been appended with the maximum value in list `a`, which is `maxa`.
