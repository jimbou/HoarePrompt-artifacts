The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is an integer plus one and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than `i` plus one.
State: **`YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than `i` plus one, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is an integer plus one. If `founds` is True, then `b` is a list with an additional element `maxa`, and `s` is a list with an additional element `maxa` and `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `founds` is False, then if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, `b` is a list with an additional element `maxa`, and `s` is a list with an additional element `maxa`. Otherwise, `founds` is False, `foundb` is True, `i` is an integer, `b` is a list with an additional element `maxa`, and `s` is a list with two additional elements: `a[ps - 1]` and `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]**
