Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 2, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], sb + 2 * b[i], sb + 3 * b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i], ss + 2 * s[i], ss + 3 * s[i], sb is 3 * b[i], ss is 3 * s[i], ptsb is a list containing len(s) elements which are 0 + rem * b[i], 0 + (rem + 1) * b[i], ..., 0 + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * b[i], ptss is a list containing len(s) elements which are 0 + rem * s[i], 0 + (rem + 1) * s[i], ..., 0 + (rem - (len(s) - 2)) * s[i], rem is k - len(s), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], s must have at least 3 elements.**

The code modifies the values of `preb`, `sb`, `pres`, `ss`, but does not affect any other variables. The value of `preb` is extended with `sb + b[i]`, `sb + 2 * b[i]`, and `sb + 3 * b[i]`. The value of `sb` is incremented by `b[i]` three times, making it `3 * b[i]`. The value of `pres` is extended with `ss + s[i]`, `ss + 2 * s[i]`, and `ss + 3 * s[i]`. The value of `ss` is incremented by `s[i]` three times, making it `3 * s[i]`.
