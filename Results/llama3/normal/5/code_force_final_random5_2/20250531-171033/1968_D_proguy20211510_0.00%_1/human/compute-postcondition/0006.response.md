Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, the current value of a[pb - 1] is equal to the current value of a[ps - 1] and both are equal to maxa, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop.
