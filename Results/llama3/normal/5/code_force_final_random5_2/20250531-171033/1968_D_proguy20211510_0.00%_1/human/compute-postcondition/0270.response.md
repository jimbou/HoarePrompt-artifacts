The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and pres, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `pres`. If `i` is less than `len(pres)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `pres` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `pres` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 2, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], sb + 2 * b[i], ..., sb + len(s) * b[i], pres is a list containing at least 3 elements, sb is len(s) * b[i], ss is len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1), maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], s must have at least len(s) elements, ptsb has been appended with preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss has been appended with pres[i] + rem * s[i]**
