Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is an integer, b is a list with an additional element maxa, and s is a list with an additional element maxa and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of YES, NO, MOD, alpha, _, n, k, pb, ps, p, a, maxa, founds, foundb, i remain unchanged. The list b has an additional element which is the maximum value in list a, and the list s has two additional elements: the maximum value in list a and the product of (k - (i + 1)) and the maximum value in list a.
