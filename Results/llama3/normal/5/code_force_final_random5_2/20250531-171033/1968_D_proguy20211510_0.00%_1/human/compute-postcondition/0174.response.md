Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least len(s) elements, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 0, preb is a list containing sb + b[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times, pres is a list containing ss + s[i] repeated len(s) - 1 times that must have at least 1 element, sb is sb + len(s) * b[i], ss is ss + len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing one element which is preb[i] + rem * b[i], ptss is a list containing one element which is pres[i] + rem * s[i], rem is k - (i + 1), maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer**

The code calculates the remaining value `rem` by subtracting `i + 1` from `k`. Then, it appends a new element to `ptsb` by adding `rem` times `b[i]` to `preb[i]`, and appends a new element to `ptss` by adding `rem` times `s[i]` to `pres[i]`. The values of `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` remain unchanged.
