Output State: **found is True, founds is True, s has been appended with maxa, b has been appended with (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1], i is 1, and k is greater than 1.**

Explanation: 
The first line sets foundb to True. Since founds is already True, found becomes True. The second line appends a[pb - 1] to b. The value of b is now (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[pb - 1]. The values of found, founds, s, i, and k remain unchanged.
