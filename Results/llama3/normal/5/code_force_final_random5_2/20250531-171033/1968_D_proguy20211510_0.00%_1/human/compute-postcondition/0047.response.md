Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus one, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, foundb is True, founds is unchanged, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], s is unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows: The first line sets `foundb` to `True`. The second line appends the element at index `pb - 1` of list `a` to list `b`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
