Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is False, i is an integer, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `pb` and `b`. The first line appends the element at index `pb - 1` in list `a` to list `b`. The second line updates the value of `pb` to be the element at index `pb - 1` in list `p`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
