Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, founds is True, foundb is True, i is an integer.**

The code snippet appends a new element to both list `b` and list `s`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, where `k` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is an integer, and `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`. The `break` statement does not affect the variables' values. All other variables remain unchanged.
