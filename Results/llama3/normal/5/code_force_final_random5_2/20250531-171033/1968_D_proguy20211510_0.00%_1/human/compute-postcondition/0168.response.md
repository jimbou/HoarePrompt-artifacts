The code snippet modifies the lists `preb` and `pres` by appending the sum of `sb` and `b[i]`, and the sum of `ss` and `s[i]` respectively, one more time. It also updates the values of `sb` and `ss` by adding `b[i]` and `s[i]` to them respectively, twice. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
