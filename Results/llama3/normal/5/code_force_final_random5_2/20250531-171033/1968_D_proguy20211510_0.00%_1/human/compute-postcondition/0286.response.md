Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is the value of t, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is len(s) - 1, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], sb + 2 * b[i], ..., sb + len(s) * b[i], pres is a list containing at least len(s) elements, sb is len(s) * b[i], ss is len(s) * s[i], ptsb is a list containing preb[i] + rem * b[i] for all i in range(len(s)), ptss is a list containing pres[i] + rem * s[i] for all i in range(len(s)), rem is 0, maxs is the maximum value in ptss, maxb is the maximum value in ptsb, b is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise b is a list containing a[pb - 1], s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if foundb is True, otherwise s is a list containing (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and a[ps - 1], s must have at least len(s) elements. If maxs is greater than maxb, 'Sasha' is printed. If maxs is less than maxb, 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that the value of `_` is now equal to the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. This means that the loop has executed `t` times, and the final output state reflects the results of all `t` test cases.
