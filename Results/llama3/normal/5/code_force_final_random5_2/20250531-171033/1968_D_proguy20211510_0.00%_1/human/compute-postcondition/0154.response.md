Output State: **foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1].**

The first line assigns True to foundb. The second line appends a[pb - 1] to the list b. Since foundb is True, b is modified by adding a new element. The value of the new element is a[pb - 1], which is determined by the value of pb and the list a. The value of founds and the list s are not affected by the code snippet.
