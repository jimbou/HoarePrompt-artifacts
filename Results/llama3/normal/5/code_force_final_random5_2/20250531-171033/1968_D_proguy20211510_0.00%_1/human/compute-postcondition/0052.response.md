Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus one, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a. foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element maxa. founds is True, s is a list with an additional element a[ps - 1] and an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

In this final state, the values of YES, NO, MOD, alpha, _, n, k, pb, ps, p, a, and maxa remain unchanged. The value of foundb is True, and the list b has an additional element maxa. The value of founds is True, and the list s has an additional element a[ps - 1] and an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.
