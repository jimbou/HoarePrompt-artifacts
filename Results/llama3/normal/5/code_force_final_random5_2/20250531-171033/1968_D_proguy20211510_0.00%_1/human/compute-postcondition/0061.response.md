Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus two, pb is p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a. If both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The code modifies the value of `pb` and appends an element to the list `b`. The value of `pb` is updated to be the value at index `pb - 1` in the list `p`. The list `b` is appended with the element at index `pb - 1` in the list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
