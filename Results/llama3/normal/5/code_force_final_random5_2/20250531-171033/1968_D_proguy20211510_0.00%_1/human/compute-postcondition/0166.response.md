Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is a list of integers, s is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, founds is True, foundb is True, i is 0, preb is a list containing sb + b[i], pres is a list containing ss + s[i], sb is sb + b[i], ss is ss + s[i], ptsb is a list, ptss is a list, rem is 0, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer**

In the final state, the values of YES, NO, MOD, alpha, _, n, k, pb, ps, p, a, maxa, b, s, founds, foundb, ptsb, ptss, rem, maxs, and maxb remain unchanged. The variable i is still 0. The list preb now contains the sum of sb and the first element of b, while the list pres contains the sum of ss and the first element of s. The variable sb has been incremented by the first element of b, and the variable ss has been incremented by the first element of s.
