Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer that must be greater than i + 1, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, i is an integer that is increased by 1, preb is a list, pres is a list, sb is an integer, ss is an integer, ptsb is a list, ptss is a list, rem is k - len(s) - 2, maxs is an integer, maxb is an integer. If foundb is True, then b is a list that includes maxa and an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list containing the value of a[pb - 1] and an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, pb is updated to the value of p[pb - 1] and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and an additional element equal to maxa. s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. If both foundb and founds are True, then b and s are lists with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending `maxa` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `rem` has been updated to `k - len(s) - 2` because the length of `s` has increased by 1. The rest of the conditions and relationships between variables remain the same as in the initial state.
