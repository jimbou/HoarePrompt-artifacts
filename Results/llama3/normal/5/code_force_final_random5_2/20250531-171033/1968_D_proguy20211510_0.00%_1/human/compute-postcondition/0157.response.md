Postcondition: ***If foundb is True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if founds is True. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and no changes are made to s. If foundb is False, then if both foundb and founds are True, b and s are lists with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1]. Otherwise, if both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 2] and s remains unchanged. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s remains unchanged. pb is now equal to p[pb - 1].***
