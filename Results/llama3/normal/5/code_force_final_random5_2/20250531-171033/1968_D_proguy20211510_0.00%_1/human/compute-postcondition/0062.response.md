Postcondition: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus two, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb and founds are True, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, pb is updated to p[pb - 1]. If both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
