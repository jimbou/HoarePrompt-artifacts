Output State: **If both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 2] and s remains unchanged. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s remains unchanged. pb is now equal to p[pb - 1].**

In this output state, the code has appended an element to list b, which is either a[pb - 2] or a[pb - 1] depending on the values of foundb and founds. The value of pb has also been updated to p[pb - 1]. List s and the values of foundb and founds remain unchanged.
