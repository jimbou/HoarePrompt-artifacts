The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `len(s) - 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0.
