Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result to stdout. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of four lines: the first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, and P_S; the second line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n; and the third line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n. The function then determines the winner of a game based on the input values and prints 'Sasha', 'Bodya', or 'Draw' to indicate the winner. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
