The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `s`. If `i` is less than `len(s)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `s` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `s` must have at least 3 elements.
