The code modifies the values of `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`. The first line updates the value of `rem` to be `k - (i + 1)`. The second and third lines append new elements to the lists `ptsb` and `ptss`, respectively. The new elements are calculated by adding the product of `rem` and the corresponding element from `b` or `s` to the element at index `i` in `preb` or `pres`. The value of `i` is not modified, so it remains 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
