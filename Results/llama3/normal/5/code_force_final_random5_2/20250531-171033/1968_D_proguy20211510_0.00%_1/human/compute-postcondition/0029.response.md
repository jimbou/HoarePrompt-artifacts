Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is an integer, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa.**

The code modifies the values of `foundb` and `b`. The first line sets `foundb` to `True`. The second line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]`, which is equal to `maxa`, to the list `b`. Since both `foundb` and `founds` are now `True`, the lists `b` and `s` are updated to include an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
