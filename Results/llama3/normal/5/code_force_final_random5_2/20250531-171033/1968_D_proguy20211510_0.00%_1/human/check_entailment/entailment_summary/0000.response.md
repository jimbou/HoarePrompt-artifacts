Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the input values. The program first checks if the maximum value in the array 'a' is present at the starting positions of either Bodya or Sasha. If it is, the program prints the corresponding winner. If not, the program simulates the game for 'k' turns, keeping track of the scores of both players. The program then calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering all possible moves and prints the winner based on the maximum scores.

Correctness: **True**
