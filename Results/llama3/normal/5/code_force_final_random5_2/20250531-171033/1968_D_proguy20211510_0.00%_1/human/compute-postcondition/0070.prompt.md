Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, b is an empty list, s is an empty list, founds is False, foundb is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is an integer. If founds is True, then b is a list with an additional element maxa, and s is a list with an additional element maxa and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If founds is False, then if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, b is a list with an additional element maxa, and s is a list with an additional element maxa. Otherwise, founds is False, foundb is True, i is an integer, b is a list with an additional element maxa, and s is a list with two additional elements: a[ps - 1] and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and ps is updated to p[ps - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus one, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a. If founds is True, then if foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is unchanged. Otherwise, pb is updated to p[pb - 1]. If founds is False, then if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element maxa, and founds is True, s is a list with an additional element a[ps - 1] and an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, ps is updated to p[ps - 1]. If foundb is True, then b is a list with an additional element maxa. If both foundb and founds are True, then s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element a[ps - 1]. If foundb is False, then if a[pb - 1] equals maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is unchanged. Otherwise, pb is updated to p[pb - 1]. If both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element a[pb - 1], and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus two, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a. If founds is True, then s is a list with an additional element maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb and founds are True, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element maxa. Otherwise, pb is updated to p[pb - 1] and s is a list with an additional element maxa. If both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged except s is a list with an additional element maxa. If founds is False, then if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element maxa, founds is True, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, if foundb is True, then b is a list with an additional element maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb and founds are True, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, pb is updated to p[pb - 1]. If both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. s is a list with an additional element a[ps - 1], and ps is updated to p[ps - 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
