Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than i plus two, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a. If foundb is True, then b is a list with an additional element maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb and founds are True, b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element maxa. Otherwise, pb is updated to p[pb - 1] and s is a list with an additional element maxa. If both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and s is a list with an additional element (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and an additional element maxa. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged except s is a list with an additional element maxa.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `s` has an additional element `maxa`, which is the maximum value in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
