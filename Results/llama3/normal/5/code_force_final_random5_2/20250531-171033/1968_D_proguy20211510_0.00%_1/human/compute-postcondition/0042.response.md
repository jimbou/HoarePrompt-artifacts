Postcondition: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than 0, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, maxa is the maximum value in a, founds is True, foundb is True, i is an integer. If founds is True, then b is a list with an additional element maxa, and s is a list with an additional element maxa and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If founds is False, then if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, b is a list with an additional element maxa, and s is a list with an additional element maxa. Otherwise, founds is False, foundb is True, i is an integer, b is a list with an additional element maxa, and s is a list with two additional elements: a[ps - 1] and (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, and ps is updated to p[ps - 1].**
