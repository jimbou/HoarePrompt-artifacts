Postcondition: **If founds is True, then if foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If foundb is False, then if both foundb and founds are True, b and s are lists with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa and maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, if both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 2] and s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s is a list with an additional element equal to maxa. pb is now equal to p[pb - 1]. If founds is False, then if a[ps - 1] equals maxa, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to a[ps - 1]. Otherwise, if foundb is True, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and s is a list with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa if founds is True. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to maxa and no changes are made to s. If foundb is False, then if both foundb and founds are True, b and s are lists with an additional element equal to (k - (i + 1)) * maxa. If a[pb - 1] equals maxa, then foundb is True and b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1]. Otherwise, if both foundb and founds are True, then b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 2] and s remains unchanged. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element equal to a[pb - 1] and s remains unchanged. pb is now equal to p[pb - 1]. If a[ps - 1] does not equal maxa, then s is a list with an additional element equal to a[ps - 1] and ps is now equal to p[ps - 1].**
