Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 0 - 0 = 0 has been printed, `q` is the first character in the string `e` and is '+', stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `P` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The string `e` is still non-empty, and the first character `q` is still '+'. The difference between '+' characters and non-'+' characters in the original string `e` has already been printed as 0. The input value is still stored in `s`, and `i` remains 2. The standard input is still empty.
