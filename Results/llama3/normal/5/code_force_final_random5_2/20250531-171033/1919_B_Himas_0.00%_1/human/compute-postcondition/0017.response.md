To determine what will be printed when the statement `print(P - M)` executes, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

1. **Initial State and Variables**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is an integer.
   - `e` is an empty string.
   - `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e`.
   - `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e`.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Since `e` is an empty string, it does not contain any '+' or '-' characters.
   - Therefore, `P` (the number of '+' characters in `e`) is 0.
   - Similarly, `M` (the number of '-' characters in `e`) is also 0.

3. **Execution of `print(P - M)`**:
   - When the statement `print(P - M)` is executed, it calculates the difference between `P` and `M`.
   - Given that both `P` and `M` are 0 (as deduced from the initial state), the difference `P - M` equals 0.

4. **Output**:
   - The statement will print the result of the subtraction, which is 0.

Output: **0**
