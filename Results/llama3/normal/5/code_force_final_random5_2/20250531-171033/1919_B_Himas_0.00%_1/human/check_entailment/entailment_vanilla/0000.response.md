Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `e` itself. It then initializes two variables `P` and `M` to 0, which are used to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, respectively.

The program then iterates over each character in the string `e`. If the character is '+', it increments `P` by 1, and if the character is '-', it increments `M` by 1. Finally, it prints the difference between `P` and `M`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The reasoning behind this program is that the minimum possible penalty can be achieved by splitting the array into subarrays that have a sum of either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the absolute value of 1 or -1 is 1. Therefore, the minimum possible penalty is the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string.

Correctness: **True**
