Output State: **i is 1, s is an integer equal to the input value, e is a string equal to the second input value, P is 0, M is 0, stdin is empty**

Explanation:
The code block consists of four lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `s`. The second line assigns the string value of the second input to `e`. The third and fourth lines assign 0 to `P` and `M`, respectively. 

Since `i` is not modified by the code, its value remains 1. The values of `s` and `e` are updated based on the input values. The values of `P` and `M` are reset to 0. Stdin is empty after the code execution because two inputs have been read.
