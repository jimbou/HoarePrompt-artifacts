Output State: **`i` is 3, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a non-empty string that has at least 2 characters and the first character has been removed, `q` is the second character in the string `e`, if `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0, if `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 3, otherwise, it is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
