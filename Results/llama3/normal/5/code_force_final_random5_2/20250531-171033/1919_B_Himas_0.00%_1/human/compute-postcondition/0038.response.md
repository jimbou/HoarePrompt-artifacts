To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are `i` and the `range` object created by `int(input())`. Since `input()` is a function that reads input from the user, we can assume that the input value is not changed between iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and the input value is stored in `s`. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the input value remains the same.

State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is an empty string, `stdin` is empty, `q` is not defined, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e` which is 0, and `M` is the number of characters in the original string `e` that are not '+' which is 0, and the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 0 - 0 = 0 is being printed**
