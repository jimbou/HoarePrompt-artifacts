The code increments the value of `M` by 1. The initial state of `M` depends on the value of `q`, which is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `M` is 0, and if `q` is not '+', then `M` is 2.

After incrementing `M` by 1, if `q` is '+', then `M` becomes 1. If `q` is not '+', then `M` becomes 3.

The values of the other variables are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.**
