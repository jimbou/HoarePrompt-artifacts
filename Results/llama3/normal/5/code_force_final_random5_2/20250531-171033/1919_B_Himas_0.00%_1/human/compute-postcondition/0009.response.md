Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 2, otherwise, it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.
