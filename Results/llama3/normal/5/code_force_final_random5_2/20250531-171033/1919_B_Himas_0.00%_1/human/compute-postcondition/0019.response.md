To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input value, which is converted to an integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The input value is not explicitly stored in a variable, but we know that it is converted to an integer and used as the upper bound for the range. Since `i` is 0, the input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `s`, `e`, `P`, and `M` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is 0, `M` is 0**
