The code prints the difference between the number of '+' characters in the original string `e` and the number of characters in the original string `e` that are not '+'.

Since `e` is an empty string, it does not contain any '+' characters or any other characters. Therefore, `P` is 0 (the number of '+' characters in an empty string is 0) and `M` is also 0 (the number of characters in an empty string that are not '+' is 0).

Output: **0**
