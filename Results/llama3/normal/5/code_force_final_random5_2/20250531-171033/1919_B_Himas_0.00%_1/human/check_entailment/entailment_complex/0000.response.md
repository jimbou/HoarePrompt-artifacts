Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases from standard input and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer `s` (which is not used anywhere in the program, but that's okay) and a string `e` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
3. It initializes two counters, `P` and `M`, to 0. `P` will count the number of '+' characters, and `M` will count the number of '-' characters.
4. It iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', it increments `P`. If `q` is '-', it increments `M`.
5. Finally, it prints the difference between `P` and `M`, which is the minimum possible penalty.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It splits the input string into '+' and '-' characters, counts the number of each, and prints their difference, which is the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
