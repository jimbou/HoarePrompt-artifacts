According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If the string `e` has at least one more character, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, stdin is empty. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `e` must have at least one more character and the variable `q` is the next character in the string `e`. The variable `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3. The difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 0 - 0 = 0 has been printed, so the difference is increased by 1 if `q` is '+' and decreased by 1 if `q` is not '+'. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.
State: **`i` is 3, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a non-empty string, the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 1 - 1 = 0 has been printed, stdin is empty. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
