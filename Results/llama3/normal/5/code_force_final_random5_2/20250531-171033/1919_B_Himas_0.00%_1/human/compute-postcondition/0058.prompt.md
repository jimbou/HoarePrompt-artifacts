You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 5000) and then a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-".
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        
        e = input()
        
        P = 0
        
        M = 0
        
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        
        print(P - M)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to the number of test cases, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is an empty string, `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in the original string `e` which is 0, `M` is equal to the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 0, the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is `P` - `M` = 0 has been printed, `q` is not defined, stdin is empty, and this is printed: 0

```

Return Postconditions: `i` is equal to the number of test cases, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is an empty string, `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in the original string `e` which is 0, `M` is equal to the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 0, the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is `P` - `M` = 0 has been printed, `q` is not defined, stdin is empty, and this is printed: 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
