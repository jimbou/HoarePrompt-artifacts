The only object in the loop head is variable `q` and string `e`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`.  If the string `e` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the first character in the string `e`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `e` must have at least 2 characters and the `q` is the second character in the string `e`. The other variables are not in the loop head, so their states remain the same.
State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.**
