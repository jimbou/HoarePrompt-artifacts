Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and printing their difference. This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the total penalty is the sum of the penalties of all subarrays. By counting the number of '+' and '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the sum of the array, and by printing their difference, it calculates the absolute value of the sum. The length of the array is not explicitly needed because the penalty is minimized when the array is not split, and the length of the array is equal to the number of '+' and '-' characters.

Correctness: **True**
