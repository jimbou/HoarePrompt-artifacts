Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by simply calculating the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to have as many arrays with sum 0 as possible, and the remaining arrays with sum 1 or -1. The program achieves this by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters and then printing their absolute difference.

The program works correctly for all possible inputs because it does not matter how the '+' and '-' characters are arranged in the string. The program will always correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty.

For example, if the input string is "+++++", the program will correctly output 5, which is the minimum possible penalty. If the input string is "-----", the program will correctly output 5, which is the minimum possible penalty. If the input string is "+-+-+--", the program will correctly output 0, which is the minimum possible penalty.

In all cases, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by simply calculating the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
