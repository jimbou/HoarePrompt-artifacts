Output State: **`i` is 3, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a non-empty string, the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 1 - 1 = 0 has been printed, `M` is 2 if `q` is not '+', `M` is 1 if `q` is '+', `P` is 1 if `q` is '+', `P` is 0 if `q` is not '+', stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `M` is now 1, and `P` is still 1. If `q` is not '+', then `M` is now 2, and `P` is still 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
