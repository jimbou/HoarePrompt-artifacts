Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `M` is now 1. Otherwise, `M` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
