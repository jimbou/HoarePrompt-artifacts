Output State: **`i` is equal to the number of test cases, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is an empty string, `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in the original string `e` which is 0, `M` is equal to the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 0, the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is `P` - `M` = 0 has been printed, `q` is not defined, stdin is empty, and this is printed: 0**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for all the test cases, and for each test case, it has calculated the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the input string `e`. The loop has printed this difference for each test case, and after all iterations, the loop variables `i`, `s`, `e`, `P`, `M`, and `q` have reached their final values, with `i` equal to the number of test cases, `s` equal to the input value, `e` an empty string, `P` and `M` both 0, and `q` not defined. The stdin is empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
