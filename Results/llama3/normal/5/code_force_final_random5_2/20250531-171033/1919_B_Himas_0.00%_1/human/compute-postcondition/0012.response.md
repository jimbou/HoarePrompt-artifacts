The only objects in the loop head are variables  q and e, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string e.  If the string has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, e has at least 2 characters, q is the second character in the string e. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 3 characters and the q is the third character in the string e.
State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.**
