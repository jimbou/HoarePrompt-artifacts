Output State: **`i` is 3, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a non-empty string that has at least 2 characters and the first character has been removed, `q` is the second character in the string `e`, If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `M` is now 1. If `q` is not '+', then `M` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
