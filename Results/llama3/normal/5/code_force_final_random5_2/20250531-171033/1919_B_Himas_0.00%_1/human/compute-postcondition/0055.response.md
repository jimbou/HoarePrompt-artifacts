Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in the original string `e`.
* `M` is equal to the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e`.
* The difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` is `P - M = 0`, which has already been printed.
* `e` is an empty string.

Since `e` is an empty string, it does not contain any '+' characters or any other characters. Therefore, `P` (the number of '+' characters) is 0, and `M` (the number of characters that are not '+') is also 0.

The print statement `print(P - M)` will print the difference between `P` and `M`, which is 0 - 0 = 0.

Output: **0**
