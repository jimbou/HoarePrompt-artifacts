Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input value that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `M` now depends on the value of `q`, which is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `M` is 1, otherwise, `M` is 2. The values of `i`, `s`, `e`, `P`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state.
