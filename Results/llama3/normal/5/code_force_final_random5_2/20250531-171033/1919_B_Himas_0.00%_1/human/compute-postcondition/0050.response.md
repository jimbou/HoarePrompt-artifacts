According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If `e` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is a non-empty string, `i` is 3, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `e` must have at least 2 characters and the first character has been processed. So the first character is removed from the string `e` and the second character is assigned to `q`. The value of `i`, `s`, `P`, `M` is not changed.
State: **`i` is 3, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a non-empty string that has at least 2 characters and the first character has been removed, `q` is the second character in the string `e`, stdin is empty. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
