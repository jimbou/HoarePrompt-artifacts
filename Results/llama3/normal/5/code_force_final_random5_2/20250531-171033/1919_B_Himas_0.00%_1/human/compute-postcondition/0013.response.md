Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` is now 3, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.
