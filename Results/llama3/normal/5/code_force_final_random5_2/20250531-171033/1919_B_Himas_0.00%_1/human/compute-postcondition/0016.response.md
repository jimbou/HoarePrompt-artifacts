Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e`. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the string `e` is empty, and the variables `P` and `M` hold the count of '+' and '-' characters, respectively, from the original string `e`. The other variables `i` and `s` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.
