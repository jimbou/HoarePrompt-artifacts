The only variable in the loop head is `q` and `e`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If the string `e` has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `e` has at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `e` must have at least 3 characters and the `q` is the third character in the string `e`. 
State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is a non-empty string equal to the second input value that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
