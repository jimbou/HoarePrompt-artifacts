Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 5000) and then a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-".
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(P - M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e` which is 0, `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e` which is 0, and this is printed: 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is an empty string, `stdin` is empty, `q` is not defined, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e` which is 0, and `M` is the number of characters in the original string `e` that are not '+' which is 0, and the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 0 - 0 = 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the input value, `e` is an empty string, `P` is equal to the number of '+' characters in the original string `e` which is 0, `M` is equal to the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is 0, the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of characters that are not '+' in the original string `e` which is `P` - `M` = 0 has been printed, `q` is not defined, stdin is empty, and this is printed: 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
