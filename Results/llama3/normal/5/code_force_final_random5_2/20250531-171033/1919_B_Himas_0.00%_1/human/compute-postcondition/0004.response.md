Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, `q` is the first character in the string `e` and equals '+'. stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `P` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input.
