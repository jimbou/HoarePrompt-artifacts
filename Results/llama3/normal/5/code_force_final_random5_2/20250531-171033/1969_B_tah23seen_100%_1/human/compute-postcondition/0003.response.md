Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `cost` is 0, `one` is 1, the first character of the string `s`, `i`, is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `one` has been updated to 1, as it was initially 0 and incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still consists of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is still within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5. The `cost` is still 0. The first character of the string `s`, `i`, is still '1'.
