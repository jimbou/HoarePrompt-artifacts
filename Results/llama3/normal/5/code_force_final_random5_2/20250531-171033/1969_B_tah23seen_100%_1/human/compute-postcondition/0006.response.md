Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `cost` is `one + 1`, `one` is greater than 0, `i` is '0'**.

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been updated to be the sum of the current value of `one` and 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still consists of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is still within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5. The value of `one` is still greater than 0, and the value of `i` is still '0'.
