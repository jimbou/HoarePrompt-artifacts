Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. The correct operation is to choose the substring "10" and cyclically shift it to get "01", which is sorted in non-descending order.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for the presence of '1's and '0's in the string, but it does not consider the actual positions of these characters. It simply adds the count of '1's to the cost whenever it encounters a '0', which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

A correct approach would be to find the longest contiguous substring of '1's and '0's, and then calculate the cost based on the length of these substrings.
