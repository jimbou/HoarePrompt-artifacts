The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least one more character the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 0 and at most 2 * 10^5 - 1 characters, `i` is the next character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5 characters and `i` is the next character in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is '1', `one` is increased by 1. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is increased by `one + 1`.**
