Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve this problem. It iterates through the string, keeping track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered so far (`one`). Whenever it encounters a '0' after a sequence of '1's, it increments the cost by the length of the sequence plus one (`one + 1`). This is because a cyclic shift operation is needed to move the '1's to the left of the '0'.

The program returns the total cost, which is the sum of the lengths of all sequences of '1's that were followed by a '0' in the original string.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required operations. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, which is efficient given the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
