Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If `i` is '1', `one` is increased by 1. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is increased by `one + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been increased by `one + 1`, but only if `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0. The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `one` is still increased by 1 if `i` is '1'.
