#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: The final state of the loop is that `s` is an empty string, `one` is the total number of '1's in the original string, and `cost` is the total number of '1's that were followed by a '0' in the original string.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of '1's that were followed by a '0' in the original string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the total number of '1's that were immediately followed by a '0' in the input string. It takes a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s as input and returns an integer representing the count of such occurrences. The input string is not modified by the function.
