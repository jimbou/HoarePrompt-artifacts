Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `one` is increased by 1, If `i` is '1', `one` is increased by 1. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is increased by `one + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `one` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still consists of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is still at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5. The value of `i` is still the next character in the string `s`. The conditions for increasing `one` and `cost` are still valid.
