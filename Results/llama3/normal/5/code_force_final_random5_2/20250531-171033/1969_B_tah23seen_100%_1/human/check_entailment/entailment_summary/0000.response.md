Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order. 

The function iterates over the string `s` and keeps track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered so far in the variable `one`. Whenever it encounters a '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means that the previous '1's need to be shifted to the right of the current '0' to make the string sorted. The cost of this operation is `one + 1`, which is added to the total cost.

The function correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) by not adding any cost in this case.

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
