According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, cost is 0 and one is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the string s must have at least 1 character and the i is the first character in the string s.
State: **s is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, cost is 0, one is 0, i is the first character in the string s**
