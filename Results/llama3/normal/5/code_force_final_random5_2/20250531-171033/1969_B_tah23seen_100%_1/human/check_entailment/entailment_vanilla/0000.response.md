Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum total cost.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Initialize a variable `cost` to 0, which will store the minimum total cost.
2. Initialize a variable `one` to 0, which will count the number of consecutive '1's in the string.
3. Iterate through the string `s` character by character. For each character:
   - If the character is '1', increment the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means we've encountered a '0' after a sequence of '1's. In this case, we need to perform a cyclic shift to move the '1's to the left of the '0'. The cost of this operation is `one + 1`, which is added to the `cost` variable.
4. After iterating through the entire string, return the `cost` variable, which represents the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

The program's logic is correct because it identifies the sequences of '1's that need to be shifted to the left of the '0's and calculates the minimum cost to do so. The use of the `one` counter is efficient, as it allows the program to keep track of the number of consecutive '1's without having to iterate through the string multiple times.

Correctness: **True**
