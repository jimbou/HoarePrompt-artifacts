Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The problem statement asks for the minimum total cost to make the binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
* The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the binary string `s` as input and returns the total number of '1's that were immediately followed by a '0' in the string.
* The function iterates through the string, keeping track of the number of '1's encountered so far (`one`). Whenever it encounters a '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it increments the `cost` by `one + 1`. This is because a cyclic shift is needed to move the '1's to the left of the '0'.
* The function returns the total `cost`, which represents the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

The key insight here is that the program is not actually performing the cyclic shifts, but rather counting the number of shifts needed to sort the string. This is a clever optimization, as it avoids the need to actually perform the shifts.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
