Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s and its length is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5. If the first character of the string `s`, `i`, is '1', then `cost` is 0 and `one` is 1. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, then `cost` is `one + 1`. Otherwise, `cost` remains 0.***
