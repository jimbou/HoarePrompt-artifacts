Output State: **`n` is greater than -1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples (x, y), `res` is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first two and last two tuples in `coord`, `i` is 4, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin is empty, and the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first two and last two tuples in `coord` which is `res` has been printed**.

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, so it is now greater than -1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first two and last two tuples in `coord` has been printed.
