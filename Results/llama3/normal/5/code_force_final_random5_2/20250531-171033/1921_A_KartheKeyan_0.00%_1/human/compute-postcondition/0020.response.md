The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 5, so for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 4.
State: **n is greater than 0, coord is a list containing two tuples (x, y) and (x, y), res is 0, i is less than 4, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin is empty**
