Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of increasing x-coordinates. The program sorts the coordinates based on the x-coordinates, but it assumes that the y-coordinates are also in the correct order. However, this is not guaranteed.

For example, if the input coordinates are (1, 5), (4, 2), (1, 2), (4, 5), the program will sort them as (1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5). However, the correct order should be (1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5) is not the correct order for the y-coordinates.

To fix this issue, the program should sort the coordinates based on both x and y coordinates. One way to do this is to use a custom sorting function that takes into account both x and y coordinates.

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look like:
```
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        res = 0
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        coord.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
        p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
        res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))
        print(res)
        n -= 1
```
This corrected code sorts the coordinates based on both x and y coordinates, ensuring that the program works correctly for all possible input cases.
