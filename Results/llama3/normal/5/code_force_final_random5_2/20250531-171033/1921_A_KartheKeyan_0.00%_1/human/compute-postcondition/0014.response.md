The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than or equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of two integers sorted in ascending order, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin is empty, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples is being printed**
