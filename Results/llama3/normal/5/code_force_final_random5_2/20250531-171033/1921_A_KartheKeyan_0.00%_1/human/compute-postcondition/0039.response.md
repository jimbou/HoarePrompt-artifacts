Output State: **`n` is greater than -1, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of two integers sorted in ascending order, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin is empty, and the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than -1 since it was initially greater than 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
