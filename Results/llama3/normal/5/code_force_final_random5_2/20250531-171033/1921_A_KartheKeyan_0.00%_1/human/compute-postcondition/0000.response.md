Output State: **n is an integer between 0 and 100, stdin is empty**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is between 1 and 100. The while loop runs `n` times. In each iteration, it reads an integer `l` from stdin, calculates a value `s` based on `l`, and prints `s`. After the loop finishes, `n` is decremented to 0. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, the loop runs at most 100 times. After the loop finishes, `n` is 0, and stdin is empty because all testcases have been read.
