Output State: **n is greater than 0, coord is a list containing three tuples of two integers, res is 0, stdin is empty, i is 2, x is an integer, y is an integer**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `y`. Since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of stdin. The second line appends a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` to the list `coord`. As a result, `coord` now contains three tuples of two integers. The values of `n`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by the code block.
