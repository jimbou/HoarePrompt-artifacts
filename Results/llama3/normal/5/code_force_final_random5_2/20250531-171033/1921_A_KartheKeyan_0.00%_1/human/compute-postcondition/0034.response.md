Output State: **n is greater than 0, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and two other tuples of two integers, res is 0, i is 2, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `y`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not modify `stdin`. The second line appends a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` to the `coord` list. The `coord` list initially contains two tuples of two integers, and after this line, it will contain three tuples of two integers. No other variables are affected.
