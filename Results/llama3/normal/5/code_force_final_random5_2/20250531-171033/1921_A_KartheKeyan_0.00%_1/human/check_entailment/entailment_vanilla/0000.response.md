Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners in random order.
2. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.
3. The program sorts the coordinates based on their x-values. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the points are in a consistent order, which is necessary for calculating the area of the square.
4. The program calculates the distance between the first two points (p1) and the distance between the last two points (p2) using the Euclidean distance formula.
5. The program then calculates the area of the square by multiplying the square roots of p1 and p2. This is based on the fact that the area of a square is equal to the product of its side lengths.
6. The program prints the calculated area for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
