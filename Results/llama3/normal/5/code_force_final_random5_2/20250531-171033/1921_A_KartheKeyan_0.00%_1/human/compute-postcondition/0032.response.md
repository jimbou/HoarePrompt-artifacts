Output State: **n is greater than 0, coord is a list containing a tuple of two integers and another tuple of two integers, res is 0, i is 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, stdin is empty**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `y`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not modify `stdin`. The second line appends a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` to the `coord` list. The initial state of `coord` is a list containing a tuple of two integers, so after the execution of the code, `coord` will contain two tuples of two integers. No other variables are affected.
