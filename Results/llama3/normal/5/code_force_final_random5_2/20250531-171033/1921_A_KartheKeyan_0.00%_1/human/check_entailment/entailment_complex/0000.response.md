Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square and stores them in the `coord` list.
3. It sorts the `coord` list in ascending order, which ensures that the first and second points are adjacent, and the third and fourth points are adjacent.
4. It calculates the Euclidean distances between the first and second points (`p1`) and the third and fourth points (`p2`) using the correct formula.
5. It calculates the absolute value of the product of these two distances (`res`) using the `math.sqrt` function.
6. It prints the value of `res` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
