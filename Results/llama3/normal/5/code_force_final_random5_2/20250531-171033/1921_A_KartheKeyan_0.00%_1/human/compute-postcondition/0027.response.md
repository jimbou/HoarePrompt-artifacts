According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than -1, which does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples (x, y), `res` is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first two and last two tuples in `coord`, `i` is 4, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin is empty, and the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first two and last two tuples in `coord` which is `res` has been printed**
