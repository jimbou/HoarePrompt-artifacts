According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 3, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 4.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is less than 4, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `stdin` is empty**
