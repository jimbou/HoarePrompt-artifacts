Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 0 and 100, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))
    print(res)
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of two integers sorted in ascending order, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin is empty, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than -1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples (x, y), `res` is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first two and last two tuples in `coord`, `i` is 4, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin is empty, and the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first two and last two tuples in `coord` which is `res` has been printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than -1, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of two integers sorted in ascending order, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin is empty, and the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
