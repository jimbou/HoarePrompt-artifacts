Output State: **n is greater than 0, coord is a list containing four tuples of two integers, res is 0, stdin is empty, i is 3, x is an integer, y is an integer**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable n remains greater than 0, the list coord now contains four tuples of two integers, the variable res remains 0, the standard input stdin is empty, the loop counter i is 3, and the variables x and y are integers.
