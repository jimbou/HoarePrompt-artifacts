The `print(res)` statement will print the calculated result, which is the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first two and last two tuples in the `coord` list.

Since `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples (x, y), we can denote the tuples as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), and (x4, y4). The Euclidean distance between the first two tuples is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), and the Euclidean distance between the last two tuples is sqrt((x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2).

The product of these two distances is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) * sqrt((x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2).

The absolute value of this product is the final result, which is printed by the `print(res)` statement.

Output: **the absolute value of the product of the Euclidean distances between the first two and last two tuples in the coord list**
