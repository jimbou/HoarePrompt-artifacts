To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `n` in the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `n` is not zero.

Given that `n` is an integer between 0 and 100, we need to adjust its state to guarantee that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0.

The state of `stdin` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty**
