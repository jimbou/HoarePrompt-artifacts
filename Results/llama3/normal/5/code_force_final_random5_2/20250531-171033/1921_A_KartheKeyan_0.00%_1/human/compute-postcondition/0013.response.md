Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of two integers sorted in ascending order, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, stdin is empty, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples is being printed**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `coord` still contains four tuples of two integers sorted in ascending order. The value of `res` is still the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` are still the same. The standard input is still empty, and the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples is still being printed.
