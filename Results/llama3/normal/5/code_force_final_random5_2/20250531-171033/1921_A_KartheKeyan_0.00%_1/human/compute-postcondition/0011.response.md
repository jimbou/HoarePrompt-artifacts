The code prints the value of `res`, which is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in the `coord` list.

Since the exact values of the tuples in the `coord` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the first and second tuples and the third and fourth tuples in the coord list**
