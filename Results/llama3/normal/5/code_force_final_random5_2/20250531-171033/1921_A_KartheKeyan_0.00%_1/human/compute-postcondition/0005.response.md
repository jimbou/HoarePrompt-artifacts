According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. The other variables `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `stdin` are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing one tuple of two integers, `res` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
