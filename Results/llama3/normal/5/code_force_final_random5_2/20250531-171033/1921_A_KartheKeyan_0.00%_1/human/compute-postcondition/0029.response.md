To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the range value (in this case, the constant `4`). The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(4)`, which means `i` should be less than 4 for the loop to start.

Given that `i` is currently 4, which is not within the range that would allow the loop to execute (since the range starts at 0 and ends at 3), we need to adjust `i` to be within this range. The smallest value `i` can take to ensure the loop executes is 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `stdin` is empty**
