Output State: **The color of the current vertex is 1, indicating that it has been visited, and the current vertex has been added to the path. The values of parent, graph, and node_v remain unchanged. The variable `res` now holds the result of the recursive call to `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, and `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. Either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`.**

In this output state, the color of the current vertex remains 1, indicating that it has been visited, and it is still part of the path. The values of `parent`, `graph`, and `node_v` are unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code executes a recursive call to `dfs(nei, curr, path)` and stores the result in `res`. Additionally, it creates a set `set_res` containing the elements of `res`. The state also ensures that either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not an element of `set_res`, reflecting the conditional logic applied to `nei` and `colors[nei]`.
