Based on the precondition, we can deduce the following:

* `_min_edge` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, so we can't determine its exact value. However, based on the context, it's likely that `_min_edge` is a variable that stores the minimum edge weight or value in the graph.
* `res` is the result of the `dfs` function, which is called with `node_u` as the starting node and an empty list as the third argument. The `dfs` function is not defined in the precondition, so we can't determine the exact value of `res`. However, based on the context, it's likely that `res` is a list of nodes or edges that are visited during the depth-first search.

Given this information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **(_min_edge, the length of the result of the dfs function with node_u as the starting node and an empty list as the third argument)**

In other words, the output will be a tuple containing the value of `_min_edge` (which is unknown) and the length of the list `res` (which is also unknown).
