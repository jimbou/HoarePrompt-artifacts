curr and parent are integers representing vertices in a graph, path is a list of integers representing a path in the graph, graph is a dictionary where each key is a vertex and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring vertices, colors is a list where each index represents a vertex and its corresponding value is the color of that vertex (1 for visited, 2 for fully visited), and node_v is an integer representing a specific vertex in the graph.
