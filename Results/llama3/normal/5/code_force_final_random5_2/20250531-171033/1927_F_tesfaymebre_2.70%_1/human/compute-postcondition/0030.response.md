Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `graph` is a dictionary with two keys `u` and `v`, `edges` is a non-empty sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 tuple, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the same and are the parent of `u` and `v` in the `dsu`. If the minimum edge of `parent_u` in `dsu` is less than `_min_edge`, then `_min_edge` is the minimum edge of `parent_u` in `dsu`, `node_u` is `u`, and `node_v` is `v`.***
