According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `test_cases` is greater than 0.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0**
