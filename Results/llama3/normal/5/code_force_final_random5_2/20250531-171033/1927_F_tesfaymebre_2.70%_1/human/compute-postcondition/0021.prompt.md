Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The color of the current vertex is 1, indicating that it has been visited, and the current vertex has been added to the path. The values of parent, graph, and node_v remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The color of the current vertex is 1, indicating that it has been visited, and the current vertex has been added to the path. The values of parent, graph, and node_v remain unchanged. `graph[curr]` must have at least 1 neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor of the current vertex. If the current value of `colors[nei]` is not equal to 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then the variable `res` now holds the result of the recursive call to `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, and `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. Either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program returns the result of the recursive call to dfs(nei, curr, path) if either res is empty or node_v is not in set_res. Otherwise, the program returns the result of the recursive call to dfs(nei, curr, path) if res is not empty and node_v is in set_res. If colors[nei] is equal to 2 or nei is equal to parent, the program does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program returns the result of the recursive call to dfs(nei, curr, path) if res is not empty and node_v is in set_res, otherwise it returns None, unless colors[nei] is equal to 2 or nei is equal to parent, in which case the program does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
