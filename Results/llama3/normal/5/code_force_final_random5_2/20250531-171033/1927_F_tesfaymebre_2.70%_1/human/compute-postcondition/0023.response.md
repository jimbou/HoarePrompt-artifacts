Output State: **The program returns an empty list.**

This means that the function has completed its execution and is returning an empty list as a result. This is because the recursive calls to dfs(nei, curr, path) did not return a non-empty result that included node_v, or the conditions for returning a non-empty result were not met. The current vertex remains in the path, and the values of parent, graph, and node_v remain unchanged.
