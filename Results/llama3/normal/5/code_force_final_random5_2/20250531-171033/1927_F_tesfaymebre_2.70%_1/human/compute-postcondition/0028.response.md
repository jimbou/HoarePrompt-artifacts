Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `graph` is a dictionary with two keys `u` and `v`, `edges` is a non-empty sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 tuple, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the same and are the parent of `u` and `v` in the `dsu`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, and `graph` remain unchanged. The `edges` list has one less tuple. The `dsu` instance has merged the sets containing `u` and `v`, making `parent_u` and `parent_v` the same.
