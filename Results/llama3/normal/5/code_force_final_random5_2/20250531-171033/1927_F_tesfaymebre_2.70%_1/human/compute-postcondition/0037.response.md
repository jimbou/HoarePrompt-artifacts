The code prints the elements of the `res` list.
Since the exact `res` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the `res` list.
Output: **elements of the res list (where res is the result of the dfs function with node_u as the starting node and an empty list as the third argument)**
