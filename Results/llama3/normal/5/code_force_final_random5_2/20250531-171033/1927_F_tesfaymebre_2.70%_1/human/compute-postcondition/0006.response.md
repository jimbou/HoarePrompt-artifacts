Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0 and a function named `func_6` has been executed and returned.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the execution of the function `func_6`. The function `func_6` has been executed and has returned, but the return value is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact return value.
