Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, and the function `func_6()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` remains greater than 1, as the code does not modify this variable. The function `func_6()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are not specified, as the code snippet does not provide information about what this function does. Therefore, the output state only indicates that the function has been executed, without providing further details about its impact on the program state.
