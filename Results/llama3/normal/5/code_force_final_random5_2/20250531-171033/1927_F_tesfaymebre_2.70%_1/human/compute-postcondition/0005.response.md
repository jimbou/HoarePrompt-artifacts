The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0**
