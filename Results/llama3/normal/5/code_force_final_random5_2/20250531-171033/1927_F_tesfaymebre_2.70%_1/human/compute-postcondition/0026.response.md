The only variables in the loop head are variables  w, u, v and edges, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the edges. If the list has at least 2 tuples the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, edges has at least 2 tuples, w, u, v are the first, second and third elements of the first tuple in the edges list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 tuples and w, u, v are the first, second and third elements of the second tuple in the edges list.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, graph is a dictionary with two keys u and v, edges is a non-empty sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 tuples, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n + 1 elements, w, u, v are the first, second and third elements of the second tuple in the edges list**
