Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, graph is a dictionary with two keys u and v, edges is a non-empty sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 tuples, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n + 1 elements. If the parents of u and v in the dsu data structure are the same, then the parents of u and v are the same as the parent of the union of u and v in the dsu data structure. If the minimum edge of the parent of the union of u and v in the dsu data structure is less than _min_edge, then node_u is the first node of the second tuple in the edges list and node_v is the second node of the second tuple in the edges list. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the parents of u and v in the dsu data structure are not the same, then u and v are now in the same set in the dsu data structure, and the parents of u and v are the parent of the set containing u and v in the dsu data structure.***
