The only objects in the loop head are variables  nei and graph[curr], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the neighbors of the current vertex.  If the current vertex has at least 2 neighbors the loop executes again for the second neighbor. At the end of the last iteration, graph[curr] has at least 1 neighbor, nei is the first neighbor of the current vertex. So for the loop to be executed one more time the graph[curr] must have at least 2 neighbors and the nei is the second neighbor of the current vertex.
State: **The color of the current vertex is 1, indicating that it has been visited, and the current vertex has been added to the path. The values of parent, graph, and node_v remain unchanged. `graph[curr]` must have at least 2 neighbors, `nei` is the second neighbor of the current vertex. If the current value of `colors[nei]` is not equal to 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then the variable `res` now holds the result of the recursive call to `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, and `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. Either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`.**
