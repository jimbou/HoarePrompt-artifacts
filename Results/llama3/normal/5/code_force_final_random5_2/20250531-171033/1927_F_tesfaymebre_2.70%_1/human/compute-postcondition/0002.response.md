Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, and the function `func_6()` has been executed.**

The code snippet calls the function `func_6()`, but since the definition of this function is not provided, we cannot determine its exact impact on the program state. However, we can conclude that the function has been executed, and the value of `test_cases` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified by the code.
