Postcondition: **The program returns the result of the recursive call to dfs(nei, curr, path) if either res is empty or node_v is not in set_res. Otherwise, the program returns the result of the recursive call to dfs(nei, curr, path) if res is not empty and node_v is in set_res. If colors[nei] is equal to 2 or nei is equal to parent, the program does not return anything.**
