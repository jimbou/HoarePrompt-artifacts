The only variable in the loop head is `nei`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[curr]`. If `graph[curr]` has at least one more neighbor, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nei` is the last neighbor in `graph[curr]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `nei` must be the next neighbor in `graph[curr]`.

State: **The program returns the result of the recursive call to dfs(nei, curr, path) if either res is empty or node_v is not in set_res. Otherwise, the program returns the result of the recursive call to dfs(nei, curr, path) if res is not empty and node_v is in set_res. If colors[nei] is equal to 2 or nei is equal to parent, the program does not return anything, nei is the next neighbor in graph[curr]**
