#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function constructs a graph from a given set of edges, sorts the edges in descending order of their weights, and then uses a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum edge that connects two nodes in the same set. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes connected by the minimum edge and returns the result of the DFS, along with the minimum edge weight and the length of the DFS result. The function also prints the minimum edge weight, the length of the DFS result, and the elements of the DFS result.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) in a graph, starting from a given vertex 'curr'. It explores the graph recursively, visiting each vertex and its neighbors, and returns a path in the graph that includes a specific vertex 'node_v' if found. If 'node_v' is not found, it returns an empty list. The function also updates the color of each visited vertex to indicate whether it has been visited (color 1) or fully explored (color 2).
