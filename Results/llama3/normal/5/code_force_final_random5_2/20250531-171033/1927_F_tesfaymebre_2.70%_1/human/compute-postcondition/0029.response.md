Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, graph is a dictionary with two keys u and v, edges is a non-empty sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 tuple, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n + 1 elements, parent_u and parent_v are the same and are the parent of u and v in the dsu, _min_edge is the minimum edge of parent_u in dsu, node_u is u, node_v is v**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, and `dsu` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` also remain the same as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces three new variables: `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v`. The value of `_min_edge` is set to the minimum edge of `parent_u` in the `dsu` instance. The values of `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v`, respectively.
