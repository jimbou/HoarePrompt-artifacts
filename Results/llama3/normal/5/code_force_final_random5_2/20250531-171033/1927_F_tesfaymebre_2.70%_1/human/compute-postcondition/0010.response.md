Postcondition: ***The color of the current vertex is 1, indicating that it has been visited, and the current vertex has been added to the path. The values of parent, graph, and node_v remain unchanged. `graph[curr]` must have at least 1 neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor of the current vertex. If the current value of `colors[nei]` is not equal to 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then the variable `res` now holds the result of the recursive call to `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, and `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. Either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`.***
