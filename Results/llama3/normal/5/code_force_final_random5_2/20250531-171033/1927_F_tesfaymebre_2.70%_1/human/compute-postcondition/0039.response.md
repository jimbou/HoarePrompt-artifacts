Functionality: This function constructs a graph from a set of edges, sorts the edges in descending order, and then uses a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum edge that connects two nodes in the graph. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes connected by the minimum edge and prints the minimum edge value and the length of the DFS result. Finally, it prints the elements of the DFS result.
