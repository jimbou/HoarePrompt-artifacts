Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `graph` is a dictionary with two keys `u` and `v`, `edges` is a non-empty sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 tuple, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the same as the parent of `u` (or `v`) in the `dsu`, `w`, `u`, `v` are the first, second and third elements of the first tuple in the `edges` list.**

In this output state, the `dsu.union(u, v, w)` operation has merged the sets containing `u` and `v` in the `dsu` instance, making `parent_u` and `parent_v` the same. The `edges` list has been reduced by one tuple, and the first tuple now contains the values of `w`, `u`, and `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
