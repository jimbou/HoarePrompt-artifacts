Functionality: This function constructs a graph from a given set of edges, sorts the edges in descending order of their weights, and then uses a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum edge that connects two nodes in the same set. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes connected by the minimum edge and returns the result of the DFS, along with the minimum edge weight and the length of the DFS result. The function also prints the minimum edge weight, the length of the DFS result, and the elements of the DFS result.
