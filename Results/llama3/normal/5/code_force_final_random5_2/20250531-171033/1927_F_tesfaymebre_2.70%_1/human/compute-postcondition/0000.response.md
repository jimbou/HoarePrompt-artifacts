Output State: **`test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` is updated to be the return value of the function `func_1()`. The previous value of `test_cases` as a non-negative integer is no longer valid, as it has been overwritten by the return value of `func_1()`. The return value of `func_1()` is now the new value of `test_cases`.
