Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, graph is a dictionary with two keys u and v, edges is a sorted list in descending order containing m tuples (w, u, v), dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n + 1 elements, _min_edge is positive infinity, node_u is -1, node_v is -1, colors is a list of integers, res is a list of integers, i is m-1, u, v, and w are assigned values from func_3(), graph[u] contains m values v, graph[v] contains m values u
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `graph` is a dictionary with two keys `u` and `v`, `edges` is a non-empty sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 tuple `(w, u, v)`, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n + 1` elements. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than the original value of `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and `u` and `v` are unioned in the DSU with weight `w`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, then `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v` because `dsu.union(u, v, w)` has been executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, graph is a dictionary with two keys u and v, edges is a non-empty sorted list in descending order containing at least 2 tuples, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n + 1 elements. If the parents of u and v in the dsu data structure are the same, then the parents of u and v are the same as the parent of the union of u and v in the dsu data structure. If the minimum edge of the parent of the union of u and v in the dsu data structure is less than _min_edge, then node_u is the first node of the second tuple in the edges list and node_v is the second node of the second tuple in the edges list. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the parents of u and v in the dsu data structure are not the same, then u and v are now in the same set in the dsu data structure, and the parents of u and v are the parent of the set containing u and v in the dsu data structure.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `graph` is a dictionary with two keys `u` and `v`, `edges` is a non-empty sorted list in descending order containing at least 1 tuple, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n + 1` elements. If `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the same, then if the minimum edge of `parent_u` in `dsu` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge of `parent_u` in `dsu`, `node_u` is `u`, and `node_v` is `v`. Otherwise, `w`, `u`, `v` are the first, second and third elements of the first tuple in the `edges` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
