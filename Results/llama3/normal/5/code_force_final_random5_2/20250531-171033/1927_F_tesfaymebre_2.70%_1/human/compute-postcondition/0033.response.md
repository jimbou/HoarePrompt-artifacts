Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than 2, graph is a dictionary with two keys u and v, edges is an empty list, dsu is an instance of the DSU class with n + 1 elements. If the parents of u and v in the dsu data structure are the same, then the parents of u and v are the same as the parent of the union of u and v in the dsu data structure. If the minimum edge of the parent of the union of u and v in the dsu data structure is less than _min_edge, then node_u is the first node of the last tuple in the edges list and node_v is the second node of the last tuple in the edges list. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the parents of u and v in the dsu data structure are not the same, then u and v are now in the same set in the dsu data structure, and the parents of u and v are the parent of the set containing u and v in the dsu data structure.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the edges in the graph, and the DSU data structure has been updated accordingly. The minimum edge and the corresponding nodes have been updated if a smaller edge was found during the iterations. The parents of the nodes in the DSU data structure have been updated to reflect the unions performed during the iterations. The edges list is now empty, indicating that all edges have been processed.
