This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) in a graph, starting from a given vertex 'curr'. It explores the graph recursively, visiting each vertex and its neighbors, and returns a path in the graph that includes a specific vertex 'node_v' if found. If 'node_v' is not found, it returns an empty list. The function also updates the color of each visited vertex to indicate whether it has been visited (color 1) or fully explored (color 2).
