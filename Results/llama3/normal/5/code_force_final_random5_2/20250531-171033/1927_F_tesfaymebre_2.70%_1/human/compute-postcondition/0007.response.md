Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than or equal to 0, and the function `func_6()` has been executed `test_cases` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` will be the same as it was initially (since the loop doesn't modify it), and the function `func_6()` will have been executed as many times as the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is 0, the loop won't execute at all, and `func_6()` won't be called.
