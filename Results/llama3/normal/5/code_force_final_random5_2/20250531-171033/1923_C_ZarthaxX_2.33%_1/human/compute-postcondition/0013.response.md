Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums` minus `i`, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`, and 'NO' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement, and the number of test cases in stdin is decremented by 1.
