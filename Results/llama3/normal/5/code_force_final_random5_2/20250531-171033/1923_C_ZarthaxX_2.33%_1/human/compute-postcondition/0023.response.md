The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is at least 1. For the loop to execute again q must be at least 2.
State: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 2, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, l is an integer, r is an integer, i is n, onesInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the number of 1s in the first r elements and the number of 1s in the first l-1 elements of nums, sumInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the sum of the first r elements and the sum of the first l-1 elements of nums minus l-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**
