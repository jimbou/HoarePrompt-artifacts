Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases - q.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the values of n, nums, ones, sum, and i remain unchanged. The value of q is reduced by the number of iterations executed, and the stdin contains multiple test cases reduced by the number of iterations executed.
