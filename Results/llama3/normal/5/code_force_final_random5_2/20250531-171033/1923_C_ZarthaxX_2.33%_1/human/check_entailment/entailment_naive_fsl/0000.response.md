Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines whether a subarray is good or not based on the conditions provided.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray, respectively.

2. It then iterates over the queries and for each query, it calculates the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray.

3. The program then checks if the subarray is good by comparing the sum of the elements with the number of ones. If the sum is greater than or equal to twice the number of ones plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when the subarray has only one element, when the subarray has no ones, and when the sum of the elements is equal to the number of ones.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore the program is correct.
