Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the count of 1s and the sum of the elements minus their indices, respectively. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of the elements in a subarray and the count of 1s in that subarray.

2. The program then iterates over the queries. For each query, it calculates the count of 1s and the sum of the elements in the subarray using the `ones` and `sum` arrays.

3. The program then checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is met. This condition is derived from the problem description and ensures that the subarray can be transformed into a good array.

4. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good, and it does so efficiently by using the `ones` and `sum` arrays to avoid recalculating the sum and count of 1s for each query.

Correctness: **True**
