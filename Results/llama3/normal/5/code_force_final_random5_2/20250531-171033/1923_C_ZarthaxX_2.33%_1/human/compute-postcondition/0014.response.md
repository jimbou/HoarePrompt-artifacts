Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums` minus `i`, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `l` is equal to `r`, 'NO' is printed and the loop moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues to the next line of code.***
