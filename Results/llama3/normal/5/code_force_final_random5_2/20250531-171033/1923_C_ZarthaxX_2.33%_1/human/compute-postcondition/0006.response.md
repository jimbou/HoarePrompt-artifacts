Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, q is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 3**

The code updates the values of `ones` and `sum` at index `i` based on the value of `nums` at index `i-1`. The value of `ones[i]` is updated to be the sum of `ones[i-1]` and 1 if `nums[i-1]` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as `ones[i-1]`. The value of `sum[i]` is updated to be the sum of `sum[i-1]`, `nums[i-1]`, and -1. The values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
