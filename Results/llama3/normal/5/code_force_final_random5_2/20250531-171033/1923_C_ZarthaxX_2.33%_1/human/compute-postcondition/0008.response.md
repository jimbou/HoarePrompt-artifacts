To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `q`, which is the only variable in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `q` to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums` minus `i`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is `n`**
