The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `q` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of n positive integers, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 1**
