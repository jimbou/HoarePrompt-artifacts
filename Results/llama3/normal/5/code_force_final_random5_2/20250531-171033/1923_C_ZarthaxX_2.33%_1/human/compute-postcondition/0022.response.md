Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 1, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, l is an integer, r is an integer, i is n, onesInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the number of 1s in the first r elements and the number of 1s in the first l-1 elements of nums, sumInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the sum of the first r elements and the sum of the first l-1 elements of nums minus l-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If 2 times the number of 1s in the range from l to r plus the length of the range minus the number of 1s in the range is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the range from l to r minus l-1, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
