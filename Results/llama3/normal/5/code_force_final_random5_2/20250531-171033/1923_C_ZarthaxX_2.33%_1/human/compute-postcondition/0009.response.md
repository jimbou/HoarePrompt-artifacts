Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums` minus `i`, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` remain unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, which are split by a space. The value of `i` is still `n`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
