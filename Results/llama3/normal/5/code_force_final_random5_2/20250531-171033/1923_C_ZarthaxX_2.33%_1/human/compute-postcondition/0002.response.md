Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, q is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `q` also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified by the code. The list `nums` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `ones` is updated at index `i` to be the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`. The list `sum` is updated at index `i` to be the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums` minus `i`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
