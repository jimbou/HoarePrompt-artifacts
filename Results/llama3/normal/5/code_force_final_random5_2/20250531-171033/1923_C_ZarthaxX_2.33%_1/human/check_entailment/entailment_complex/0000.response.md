Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly initializes the `ones` and `sum` arrays to keep track of the count of 1s and the sum of the elements minus their indices, respectively.

2. The program correctly calculates the `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` variables for each query, which represent the count of 1s and the sum of the elements minus their indices in the given range, respectively.

3. The program correctly checks the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` to determine if the subarray is good. This condition is derived from the given conditions in the problem statement.

4. The program correctly handles the edge case where `l == r` and prints 'NO' in this case, as a single-element subarray cannot be good.

5. The program correctly repeats the process for all test cases and queries in the input.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
