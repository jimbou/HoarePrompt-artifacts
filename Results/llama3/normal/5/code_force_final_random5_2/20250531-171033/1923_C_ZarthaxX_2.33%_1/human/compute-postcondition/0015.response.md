Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 1, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, l is an integer, r is an integer, i is n, onesInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the number of 1s in the first r elements and the number of 1s in the first l-1 elements of nums, sumInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the sum of the first r elements and the sum of the first l-1 elements of nums minus l-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `l`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces two new variables, `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`, which are calculated based on the values of `ones` and `sum` at indices `r` and `l-1`. The value of `onesInRange` represents the difference between the number of 1s in the first `r` elements and the number of 1s in the first `l-1` elements of `nums`. Similarly, the value of `sumInRange` represents the difference between the sum of the first `r` elements and the sum of the first `l-1` elements of `nums` minus `l-1`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
