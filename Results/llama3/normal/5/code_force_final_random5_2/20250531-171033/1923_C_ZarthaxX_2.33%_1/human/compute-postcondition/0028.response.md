Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 2, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums` minus `i`, `l` is an integer equal to the first input, `r` is an integer equal to the second input, `i` is `n`, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to the difference between the number of 1s in the first `r` elements and the number of 1s in the first `l-1` elements of `nums`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to the difference between the sum of the first `r` elements and the sum of the first `l-1` elements of `nums` minus `l-1`, and if `l` equals `r`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues to the next step.***
