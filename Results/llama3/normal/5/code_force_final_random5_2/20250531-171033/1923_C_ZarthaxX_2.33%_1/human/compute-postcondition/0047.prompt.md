Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, q is at least 1, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, l is an integer, r is an integer, i is n, onesInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the number of 1s in the first r elements and the number of 1s in the first l-1 elements of nums, sumInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the sum of the first r elements and the sum of the first l-1 elements of nums minus l-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If 2 times the number of 1s in the range from l to r plus the length of the range minus the number of 1s in the range is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the range from l to r minus l-1, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, q is at least 2, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, l is an integer equal to the first input, r is an integer equal to the second input, i is n, onesInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the number of 1s in the first r elements and the number of 1s in the first l-1 elements of nums, sumInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the sum of the first r elements and the sum of the first l-1 elements of nums minus l-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer, q is at least 3, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, l is an integer equal to the first input, r is an integer equal to the second input, i is n, onesInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the number of 1s in the first r elements and the number of 1s in the first l-1 elements of nums, sumInRange is an integer equal to the difference between the sum of the first r elements and the sum of the first l-1 elements of nums minus l-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
