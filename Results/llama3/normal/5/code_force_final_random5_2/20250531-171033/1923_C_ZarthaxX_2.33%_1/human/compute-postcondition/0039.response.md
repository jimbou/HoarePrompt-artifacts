Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 3, `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the first `i` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums` minus `i`, `l` is an integer equal to the first input, `r` is an integer equal to the second input, `i` is `n`, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to the difference between the number of 1s in the first `r` elements and the number of 1s in the first `l-1` elements of `nums`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to the difference between the sum of the first `r` elements and the sum of the first `l-1` elements of `nums` minus `l-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and 'NO' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of all variables remain the same, and the only change is that we move on to the next test case. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, and 'NO' is still printed.
