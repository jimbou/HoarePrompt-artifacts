Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It creates two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the array `nums` respectively. These arrays are used to efficiently calculate the number of ones and the sum of elements in any subarray.
3. The program then iterates over the queries. For each query, it calculates the number of ones and the sum of elements in the subarray `nums[l-1:r]`.
4. It then checks if the subarray is good by checking if the sum of elements in the subarray minus the number of ones is greater than or equal to twice the number of ones plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones. This is a correct condition to check if a subarray is good.
5. If the subarray is good, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program is also efficient as it uses arrays to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of elements, which allows it to calculate these values for any subarray in constant time.

Correctness: **True**
