Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, q is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements of nums, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of nums minus i, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 2**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ones` and `sum` lists at index `i`, which is 2. The value of `ones[2]` becomes the number of 1s in the first 2 elements of `nums`, and the value of `sum[2]` becomes the sum of the first 2 elements of `nums` minus 2. The values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
