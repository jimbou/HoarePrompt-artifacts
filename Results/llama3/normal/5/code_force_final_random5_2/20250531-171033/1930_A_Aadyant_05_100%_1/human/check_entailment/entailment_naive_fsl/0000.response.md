Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on a whiteboard with 2n positive integers. The program works by first sorting the list of integers in ascending order, and then iterating over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of each pair of integers to the score.

The program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. It correctly reads the input, sorts the list of integers, and calculates the maximum final score. The program also handles the case where the number of integers on the whiteboard is odd, as it will simply ignore the last integer.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all the examples provided and should work correctly for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
