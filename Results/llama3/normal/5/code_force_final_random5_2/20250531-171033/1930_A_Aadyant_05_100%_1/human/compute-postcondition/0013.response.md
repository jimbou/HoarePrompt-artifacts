The code `s = s + int(list2[i])` adds the integer value at index `i` of `list2` to `s`. Since `s` is initially 0, it will now hold the value of the integer at index `i` of `list2`. The value of `i` is 0, so `s` will hold the value of the first integer in `list2`.

Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the first integer value in `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing at least 2 integer values, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 0**
