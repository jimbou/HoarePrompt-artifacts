Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the second and third integer values in `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing at least 4 integer values, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be the sum of the second and third integer values in `list2`, since `i` is 2 and `list2` is a sorted list containing at least 4 integer values. The other variables remain unchanged.
