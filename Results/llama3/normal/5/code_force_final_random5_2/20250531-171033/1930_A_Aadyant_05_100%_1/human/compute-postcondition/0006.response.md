Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1` and the integer value of the second string in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `list2` has been updated to include the integer value of the second string in `list1`, which is `str`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
