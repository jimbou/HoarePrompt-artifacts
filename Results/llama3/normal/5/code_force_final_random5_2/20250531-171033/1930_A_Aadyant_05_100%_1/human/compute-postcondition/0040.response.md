Output State: **n is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, s is 0, list2 is an empty list, final contains the sum of every other integer value in list2 starting from the first, and also contains the sum of every other integer value in list2 starting from the first, num is the last index of list2 that was processed by the loop plus 2, a contains the first input, list1 is an empty list, str is the last element in the list1, i is the last index of list2 that was processed by the loop, n must be greater than num, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `final`, `num`, `i`, and the relationship between `n` and `num` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `s` is reset to 0, and `list2` is reset to an empty list. The value of `a` is updated to contain the first input, and `list1` is updated to contain the second input split into a list. The value of `str` is updated to be the last element in the updated `list1`. The value of `i` is updated to be the last index of the updated `list2` that was processed by the loop. Stdin is now empty.
