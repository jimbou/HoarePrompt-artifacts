Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, which is correct according to the problem description.
2. For each test case, the program reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers themselves, which is correct according to the problem description.
3. The program sorts the `2n` integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the maximum final score.
4. The program calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first, which is the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score.
5. The program stores the calculated sum for each test case in a list `final`.
6. After processing all test cases, the program prints the sums calculated for each test case, which is the expected output according to the problem description.

The execution states of the program provided as comments also match the expected behavior of the program.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
