Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains all elements of `list1` converted to integers and sorted in ascending order, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `s` is still 0, `list2` now contains the same elements as before but in sorted order, `final` still contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is still the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` still contains the first input, `list1` still contains the second input split into a list, `str` is still the last element in the `list1`, `i` is still the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, and `stdin` still contains t-5 test cases.
