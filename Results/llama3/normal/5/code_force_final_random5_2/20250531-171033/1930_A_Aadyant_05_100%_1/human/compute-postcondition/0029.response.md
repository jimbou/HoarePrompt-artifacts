Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains all elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have `list2` containing all elements from `list1` converted to integers. The `final` variable will hold the sum of every other integer value in `list2`, starting from the first. The `num` variable will be the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1. The `str` variable will hold the last element in `list1`, and `i` will be the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `a`, and `stdin`) remain unchanged.
