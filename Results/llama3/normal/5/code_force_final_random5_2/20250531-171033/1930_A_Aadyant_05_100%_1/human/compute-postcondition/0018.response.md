Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing integer values, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `s` will be the sum of every other integer value in `list2`, starting from the first. The value of `i` will be the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop. The values of `n`, `list2`, `final`, `num`, `a`, `list1`, and stdin remain unchanged.
