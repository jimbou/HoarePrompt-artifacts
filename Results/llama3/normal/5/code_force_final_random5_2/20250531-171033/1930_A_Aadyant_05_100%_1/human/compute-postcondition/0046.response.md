Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the first three elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, `a` contains the first input, `list1` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `str` is the third element in the list1, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` must be greater than `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `list2` has been updated to include the third element of `list1` converted to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `num` is still the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, but since `list2` has been updated, `num` is now equal to the last index of the updated `list2` plus 2.
