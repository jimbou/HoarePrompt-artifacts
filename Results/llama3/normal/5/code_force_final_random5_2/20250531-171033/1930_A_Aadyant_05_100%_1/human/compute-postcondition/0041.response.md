The only objects in the loop head are variables  str and list1, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list1.  If the list1 has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, str is the last element in the list1. So for the loop to be executed  the list1 must have at least 1 element and the str is the first element in the list1.
State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, and also contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, `a` contains the first input, `list1` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `str` is the first element in the list1, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` must be greater than `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**
