Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains all elements of `list1` converted to integers and sorted in ascending order, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
    s = s + int(list2[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the first element in `list2` and 0, `list2` contains all elements of `list1` converted to integers and sorted in ascending order and must have at least one element, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the first three elements in `list2`, `list2` contains all elements of `list1` converted to integers and sorted in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the first four elements in `list2`, `list2` contains all elements of `list1` converted to integers and sorted in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
