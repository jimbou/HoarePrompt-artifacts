Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `str` is the first string in the list, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains unchanged as a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0. The value of `s` remains 0. The list `list2` now contains the integer value of the first string in `list1`. The list `final` and the variable `num` remain unchanged. The value of `a` remains a string containing an integer. The list `list1` still contains at least one string, and `str` is still the first string in the list. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
