#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is equal to the integer value of `n`, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` is equal to `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first and must have at least as many elements as the length of `final`, `num` is equal to the integer value of `n`, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` is equal to `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, and the last element in the `final` list which is `fin` is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to start with an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers. The function sorts these 2n integers, calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first, and stores this sum in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the sums calculated for each test case.
