The only variables in the loop head are variables  num and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t-1 test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and num is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, final is an empty list, num is 0**
