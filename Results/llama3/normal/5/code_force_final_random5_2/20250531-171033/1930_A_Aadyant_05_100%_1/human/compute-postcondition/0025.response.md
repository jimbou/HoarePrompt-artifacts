Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the first element of `list1` converted to an integer and the second element of `list1` converted to an integer, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list that must have at least 2 elements, `str` is the second element in the list1, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `list2` has been updated to include the second element of `list1` converted to an integer. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases.
