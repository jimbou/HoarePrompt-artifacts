Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers themselves.
3. It sorts the `2n` integers in ascending order.
4. It calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first (i.e., the minimum of each pair) by iterating over the sorted list with a step of 2.
5. It stores this sum in a list `final`.
6. After processing all test cases, it prints the sums calculated for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. By sorting the integers and summing every other integer starting from the first, it effectively calculates the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the `n` moves optimally.

Correctness: **True**
