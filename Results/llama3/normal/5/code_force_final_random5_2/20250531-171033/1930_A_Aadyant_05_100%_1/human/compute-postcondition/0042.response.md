Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the first element of `list1` converted to an integer, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, and also contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, `a` contains the first input, `list1` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `str` is the first element in the list1, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` must be greater than `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `list2` has been updated to include the first element of `list1` converted to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0. The value of `s` is still 0. The value of `final` still contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, and also contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first. The value of `num` is still the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2. The value of `a` still contains the first input. The value of `list1` is still a list that must have at least 1 element. The value of `str` is still the first element in the list1. The value of `i` is still the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop. The value of `n` must still be greater than `num`. The stdin still contains 0 inputs.
