Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, the integer value of the second string in `list1`, the integer value of the third string in `list1`, and the integer value of the third string in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `str` is the third string in `list1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `list2` has been updated by appending the integer value of the third string in `list1`, which is also stored in the variable `str`. The other variables remain unchanged.
