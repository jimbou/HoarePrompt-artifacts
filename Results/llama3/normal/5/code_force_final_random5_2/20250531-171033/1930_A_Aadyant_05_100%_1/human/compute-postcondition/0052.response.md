Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of the first and third element of `list2` and 0, `list2` is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in the original `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, `a` contains the first input, `list1` is a list that must have at least as many elements as the integer value of `n`, `str` is the last element in the list1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the third element of `list2` (since `i` is 2), in addition to the first element of `list2` and 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
