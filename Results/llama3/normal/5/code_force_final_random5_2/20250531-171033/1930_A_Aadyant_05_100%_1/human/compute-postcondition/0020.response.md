The only variable in the loop head is variable  num and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` and `n`. If `num` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `num` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `num`. 
State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing integer values, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop**
