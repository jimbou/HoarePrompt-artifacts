Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to start with an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers. The function sorts these 2n integers, calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first, and stores this sum in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the sums calculated for each test case.**
