Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all strings in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `s`, `final`, `num`, `a`, and stdin as in the initial state. However, `list2` will now contain the integer values of all strings in `list1`, and `list1` will be empty because all its elements have been processed and appended to `list2`.
