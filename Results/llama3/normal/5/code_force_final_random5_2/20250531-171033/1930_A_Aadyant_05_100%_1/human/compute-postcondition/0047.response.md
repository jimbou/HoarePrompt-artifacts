Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing all elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, `a` contains the first input, `list1` is a list that must have at least as many elements as the integer value of `n`, `str` is the last element in the list1, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` must be greater than `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, `list2` will contain all elements of `list1` converted to integers, and `final` will contain the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first. The other variables remain unchanged.
