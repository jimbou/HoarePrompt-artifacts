Output State: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of all strings in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `str` is the last string in `list1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `list2` will contain the integer values of all strings in `list1`, and `list1` will be empty because all its elements have been processed and appended to `list2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
