Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing integer values, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop.**

In this output state, the value of `final` has been updated to include the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, which was previously stored in `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
