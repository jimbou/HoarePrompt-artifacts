Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, s is 0, list2 is an empty list, final contains the sum of every other integer value in list2 starting from the first, and also contains the sum of every other integer value in list2 starting from the first, num is the last index of list2 that was processed by the loop plus 2, a contains the first input, list1 is an empty list, str is the last element in the list1, i is the last index of list2 that was processed by the loop, n must be greater than num, stdin contains 0 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the first element of `list1` converted to an integer, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, and also contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, `a` contains the first input, `list1` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `str` is the first element in the list1, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` must be greater than `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the first two elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, `a` contains the first input, `list1` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `str` is the second element in the list1, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` must be greater than `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the first three elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, `a` contains the first input, `list1` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `str` is the third element in the list1, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` must be greater than `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
