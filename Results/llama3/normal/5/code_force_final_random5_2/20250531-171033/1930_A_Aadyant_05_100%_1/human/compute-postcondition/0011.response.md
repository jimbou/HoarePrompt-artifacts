Output State: **`n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all strings in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

The code sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0. The value of `s` is still 0. The list `final` is still empty. The value of `num` is still 0. The value of `a` is still a string containing an integer. The list `list1` is still empty. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
