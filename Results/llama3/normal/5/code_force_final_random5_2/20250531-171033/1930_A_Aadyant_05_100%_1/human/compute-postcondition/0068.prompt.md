Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is equal to the integer value of `n`, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` is equal to `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for fin in final:
    print(fin)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first and must have at least 1 element, `num` is equal to the integer value of `n`, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` is equal to `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `fin` is the first element in the `final` list, and the first element in the `final` list which is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is equal to the integer value of `n`, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` is equal to `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `fin` is the second element in the `final` list, and the second element in the `final` list which is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is equal to the integer value of `n`, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` is equal to `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, and the third element in the `final` list which is `fin` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
