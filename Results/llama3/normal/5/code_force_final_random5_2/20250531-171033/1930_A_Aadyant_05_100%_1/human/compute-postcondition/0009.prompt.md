Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, s is 0, list2 is an empty list, final is an empty list, num is 0, a is a string containing an integer, list1 is a list of strings, stdin contains t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `str` is the first string in the list, stdin contains t-3 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1` and the integer value of the second string in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 strings, stdin contains t-3 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first string in `list1`, the integer value of the second string in `list1`, the integer value of the third string in `list1`, and the integer value of the third string in `list1`, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 strings, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `str` is the third string in `list1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
