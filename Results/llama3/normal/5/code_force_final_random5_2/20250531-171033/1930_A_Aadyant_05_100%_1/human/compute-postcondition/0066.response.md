The code prints the third element in the `final` list, which contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first. Since `list2` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` converted to integers, the third element in the `final` list will be the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `list2`.

Output: **the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of list2 (where list2 is a sorted list containing all elements of list1 converted to integers)**
