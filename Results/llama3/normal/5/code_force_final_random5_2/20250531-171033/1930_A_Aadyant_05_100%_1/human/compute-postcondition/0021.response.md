Output State: **n is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, s is 0, list2 is an empty list, final contains the sum of every other integer value in list2 starting from the first, num is the last index of list2 that was processed by the loop plus 1, a contains the first input, list1 contains the second input split into a list, i is the last index of list2 that was processed by the loop, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `final`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `s` is reset to 0, and `list2` is cleared. The value of `a` is updated to contain the first input, and `list1` is populated with the second input split into a list. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
