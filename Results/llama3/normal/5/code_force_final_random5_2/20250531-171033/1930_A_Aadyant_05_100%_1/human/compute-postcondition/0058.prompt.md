Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), n is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000, final is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for num in range(int(n)):
    s = 0
    list2 = []
    a = input()
    list1 = []
    b = input()
    list1 = b.split()
    for str in list1:
        list2.append(int(str))
    list2.sort()
    for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
        s = s + int(list2[i])
    final.append(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing integer values, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is 0, `a` is a string containing an integer, `list1` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `list2` contains all elements of `list1` converted to integers and sorted in ascending order, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, and also contains the sum of every other integer value in `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 1, `a` contains the first input, `list1` contains the second input split into a list, `str` is the last element in the `list1`, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a string containing an integer between 1 and 5000 that must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of every other integer value in the original `list2` starting from the first, `list2` is a sorted list containing all elements of `list1` converted to integers, `final` contains the sum of every other integer value in the original `list2` starting from the first and also contains the sum of every other integer value in the original `list2` starting from the first, `num` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop plus 2, `a` contains the first input, `list1` is a list that must have at least as many elements as the integer value of `n`, `str` is the last element in the list1, `i` is the last index of `list2` that was processed by the loop, `n` must be greater than `num`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
