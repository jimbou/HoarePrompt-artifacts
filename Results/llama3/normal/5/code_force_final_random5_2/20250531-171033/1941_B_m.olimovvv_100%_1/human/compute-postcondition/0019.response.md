Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 4, `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i]` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
