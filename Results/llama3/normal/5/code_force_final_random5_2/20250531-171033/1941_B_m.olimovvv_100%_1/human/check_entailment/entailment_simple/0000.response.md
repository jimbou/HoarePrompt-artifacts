Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The program iterates through the array from left to right, and for each element, it subtracts twice its value from the next element and its value from the element after that. This is equivalent to applying the operation described in the problem statement.

After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are not, it prints "NO", because it's not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero. If they are zero, it prints "YES", because it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array has less than three elements, because the loop will not execute in that case, and the program will print "NO" because it's not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array has three or more elements, but the first element is negative, because the loop will break as soon as it encounters a negative element, and the program will print "NO" because it's not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
