Output State: **a is at least 3, b is a list of integers with b[i + 1] reduced by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] reduced by the original value of b[i], and b[i] set to 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0, i is 0. If the original value of b[i] was less than 0, 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `b` is modified in three places: `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is set to 0. The value of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. If the original value of `b[i]` was less than 0, 'NO' is printed.
