The only objects in the loop head are variable  _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least 1 test case the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs and the _ is 1.
State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers with b[i + 1] reduced by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] reduced by the original value of b[i], and b[i] set to 0 for all i in range(0, a - 2), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs, _ is 1, i is a - 2**
