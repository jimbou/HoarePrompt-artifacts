To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, a - 2):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `a` is an integer that must be at least 3
* `i` is 1

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head variables `i` and `a`.

Since `i` is 1, and the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `a - 2`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to make it 2.

The value of `a` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `a` is still at least 3 to satisfy the loop condition.

The other variables `b`, `_`, and `stdin` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the original value of `b[i]`, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
