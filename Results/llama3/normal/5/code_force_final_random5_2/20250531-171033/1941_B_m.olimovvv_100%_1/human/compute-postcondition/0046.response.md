To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is at least 3 (since the range starts at 0 and goes up to `a - 2`). Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:


State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs.**
