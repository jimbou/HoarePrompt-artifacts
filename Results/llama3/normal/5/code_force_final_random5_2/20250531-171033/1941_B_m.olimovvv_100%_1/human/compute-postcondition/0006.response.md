Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `b[i]` is less than 0, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of breaking out of the loop or if statement.
