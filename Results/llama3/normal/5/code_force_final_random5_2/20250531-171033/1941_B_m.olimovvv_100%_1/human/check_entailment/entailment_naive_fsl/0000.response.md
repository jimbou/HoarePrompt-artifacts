Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The correct output should be "NO".

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the last two elements of the array are zero, but it does not consider the case where the first element is not zero. In this case, it is not possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

A correct solution would need to check all elements of the array, not just the last two.
