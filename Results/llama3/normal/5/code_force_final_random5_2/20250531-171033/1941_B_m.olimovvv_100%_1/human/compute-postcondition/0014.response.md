Output State: **a is at least 3, b[i + 1] is reduced by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of b[i], b[i] is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `b` is modified according to the given conditions: `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is set to 0. The value of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The variable `_` remains 0, and `i` remains 1.
