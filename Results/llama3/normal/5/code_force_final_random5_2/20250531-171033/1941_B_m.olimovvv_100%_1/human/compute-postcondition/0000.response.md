To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`, specifically the number of test cases `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0**
