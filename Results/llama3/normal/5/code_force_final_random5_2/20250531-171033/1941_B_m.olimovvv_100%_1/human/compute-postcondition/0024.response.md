To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a - 2` is greater than 0, meaning `a` must be at least 3. Since `i` is initialized to 0 in the loop head, we can adjust its state to 0. The other variables, `b`, `_`, and `stdin`, are not relevant to the loop's execution and can remain unchanged.

State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**
