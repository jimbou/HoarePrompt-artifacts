Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer that must be at least 4, `b` is a list of integers where the element at index i+1 is decreased by twice the value of the element at index i, the element at index i+2 is decreased by the value of the element at index i, and the element at index i is set to 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 2. If the element at index `i` of `b` is less than 0, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
