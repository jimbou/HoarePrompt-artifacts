Output State: **a is at least 4, b[i + 1] is reduced by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] is reduced by the original value of b[i], b[i] is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0, i is 2.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `b[i]`. The first line reduces `b[i + 1]` by twice the original value of `b[i]`, which is 0. The second line reduces `b[i + 2]` by the original value of `b[i]`, which is also 0. The third line sets `b[i]` to 0, which does not change its value since it was already 0. No other variables are affected.
