Output State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers, _ is 1, i is a - 2, stdin contains 0 inputs**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 inputs, after this line, stdin contains 0 inputs. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `b`. Since stdin is now empty, `b` is assigned an empty list.

The initial state of `a` is an integer, and the initial state of `b` is a list of integers with specific modifications. However, the code snippet does not use these initial values. Instead, it assigns new values to `a` and `b` from stdin.

The variables `_` and `i` are not affected by the code snippet, so their values remain the same.

In summary, the code snippet assigns new values to `a` and `b` from stdin, and stdin becomes empty. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged.
