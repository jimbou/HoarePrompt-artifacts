Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the described operation and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero. The program iterates over the array, applying the operation to each element and updating the next two elements accordingly. If at any point an element becomes negative, the program immediately prints 'NO' and breaks the loop. If the loop completes without finding any negative elements, the program checks the last two elements of the array. If they are both zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
