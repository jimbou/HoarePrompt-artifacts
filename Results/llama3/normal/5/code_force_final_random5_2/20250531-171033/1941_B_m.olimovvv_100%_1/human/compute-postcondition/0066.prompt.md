Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(0, a - 2):
        if b[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            break
        b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
        b[i + 2] -= b[i]
        b[i] -= b[i]
    else:
        if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer, b is a list of integers with b[i + 1] reduced by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] reduced by the original value of b[i], and b[i] set to 0 for all i in range(0, a - 2), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0, i is a - 2. If any of the original values of b[i] were less than 0, 'NO' is printed. If all the original values of b[i] were non-negative, and b[-1] is 0 and b[-2] is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is an integer that must be at least 3, b is a list of integers where b[i] is 0, b[i + 1] is decreased by twice the original value of b[i], and b[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of b[i], _ is 1, i is a - 2, and stdin contains 0 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is an integer that must be at least 4, b is a list of integers where the element at index i+1 is decreased by twice the value of the element at index i, the element at index i+2 is decreased by the value of the element at index i, and the element at index i is set to 0, _ is 0, i is a is an integer that must be at least 4, b is a list of integers where the element at index i+1 is decreased by twice the value of the element at index i, the element at index i+2 is decreased by the value of the element at index i, and the element at index i is set to 0, _ is 0, i is a - 2, stdin contains 0 inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
