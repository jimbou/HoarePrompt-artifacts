To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue executing.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, a - 2):`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `a - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is 0, `a` is at least 3, and `b[i]` is 0. We also know that `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the original value of `b[i]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, since the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `a - 2`. Therefore, `i` will be 1.

The value of `a` remains the same, since it is not modified within the loop.

The state of `b` is not explicitly modified in the loop head, but we can infer that `b[i]` will be a new value, since `i` has incremented. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `b[i]` without knowing the contents of the list `b`.

The other variables `_`, `stdin`, and the print statement are not relevant to the loop head and do not affect the state of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**
