Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i]` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, `b[i]`, `stdin`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement. The 'NO' that was being printed is still being printed.
