The code snippet modifies the list `b` by performing operations on its elements at indices `i`, `i + 1`, and `i + 2`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

1. `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`: This line subtracts twice the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`. Since `b[i]` is an integer, this operation will result in an integer value.
2. `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`: This line subtracts the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`. Again, since `b[i]` is an integer, this operation will result in an integer value.
3. `b[i] -= b[i]`: This line subtracts the value of `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0.

After executing these lines, the list `b` will be modified as follows:

* `b[i]` will be set to 0.
* `b[i + 1]` will be decreased by twice the original value of `b[i]`.
* `b[i + 2]` will be decreased by the original value of `b[i]`.

The other variables (`a`, `_`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **a is an integer that must be at least 3, b is a list of integers where b[i] is 0, b[i + 1] is decreased by twice the original value of b[i], and b[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of b[i], _ is 1, i is 0, and stdin contains 0 inputs.**
