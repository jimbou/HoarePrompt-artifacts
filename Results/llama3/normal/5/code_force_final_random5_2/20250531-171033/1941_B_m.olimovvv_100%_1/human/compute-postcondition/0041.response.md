Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the original value of `b[i]`, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, and stdin contains 0 inputs. If `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'NO' is being printed.***
