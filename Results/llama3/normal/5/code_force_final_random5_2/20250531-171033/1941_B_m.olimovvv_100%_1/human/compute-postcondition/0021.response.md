Output State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers with b[i + 1] reduced by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] reduced by the original value of b[i], and b[i] set to 0 for all i in range(0, a - 2), stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0, i is a - 2. If any of the original values of b[i] were less than 0, 'NO' is printed. If all the original values of b[i] were non-negative, and b[-1] is 0 and b[-2] is 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `a` remains unchanged.
* The list `b` has been modified such that for each index `i` in the range `0` to `a-2`, the value at index `i+1` has been reduced by twice the original value at index `i`, the value at index `i+2` has been reduced by the original value at index `i`, and the value at index `i` has been set to `0`.
* The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, with at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
* The value of `_` remains unchanged at `0`.
* The value of `i` is now `a-2`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
* If any of the original values of `b[i]` were less than `0`, the string `'NO'` is printed.
* If all the original values of `b[i]` were non-negative, and the last two elements of `b` (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are both `0`, the string `'YES'` is printed. Otherwise, `'NO'` is printed.
