Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers with b[i + 1] reduced by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] reduced by the original value of b[i], and b[i] set to 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
