Output State: **a is an integer that must be at least 3, b is a list of integers, _ is 0, i is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, b[i + 1] is decreased by twice the original value of b[i], b[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of b[i], and b[i] is 0. If the current value of b[i] was less than 0, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The list `b` is modified at indices `i`, `i + 1`, and `i + 2`. The value at index `i` is set to 0, the value at index `i + 1` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[i]`, and the value at index `i + 2` is decreased by the original value of `b[i]`. The variable `_` and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin still contains 0 inputs. Additionally, if the original value of `b[i]` was less than 0, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
