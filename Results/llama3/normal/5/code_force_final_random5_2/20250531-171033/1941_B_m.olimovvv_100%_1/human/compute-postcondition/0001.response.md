Output State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `a` becomes an integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `b`. Since `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `b` becomes a list of integers. The value of `_` remains unchanged, still being 0. The state of `stdin` is updated to contain at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
