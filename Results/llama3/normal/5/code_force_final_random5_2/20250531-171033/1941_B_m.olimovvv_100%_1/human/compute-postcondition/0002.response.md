According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer, `b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and `_` is 0. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `a` is at least 3 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**
