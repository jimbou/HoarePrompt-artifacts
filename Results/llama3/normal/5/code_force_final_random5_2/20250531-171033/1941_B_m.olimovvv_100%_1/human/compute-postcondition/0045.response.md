Output State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers, _ is 0, i is not defined, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is an integer, but its exact value is unknown because it is assigned from the input. The list `b` contains integers, but their values are also unknown because they are assigned from the input. The variable `_` remains 0, as it is not modified by the code. The variable `i` is not defined because it is not assigned a value in the code. Stdin remains empty, as it contains 0 inputs.
