The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `a` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`a` is at least 4, `b[i + 1]` is reduced by twice the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the original value of `b[i]`, `b[i]` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, `i` is 2**
