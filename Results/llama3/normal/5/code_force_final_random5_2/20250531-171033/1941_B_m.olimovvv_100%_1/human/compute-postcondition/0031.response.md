To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `a - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `a` is at least 3, `a - 2` is at least 1, which is greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, the loop can execute again.

The state of `b` is not adjusted because it is not in the loop head. The state of `_` is also not adjusted because it is not in the loop head.

State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the original value of `b[i]`, and `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the original value of `b[i]`, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
