Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the first line of stdin, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is an even number, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is an odd number, then 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the first line of input from stdin, and the remaining lines in stdin are reduced by one. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' remain the same based on the updated values of `n` and `m`.
