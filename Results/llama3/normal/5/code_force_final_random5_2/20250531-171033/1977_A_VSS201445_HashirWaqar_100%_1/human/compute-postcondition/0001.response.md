Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100)**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to be the first two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each with two integers, since one line has been consumed by the input operation.
