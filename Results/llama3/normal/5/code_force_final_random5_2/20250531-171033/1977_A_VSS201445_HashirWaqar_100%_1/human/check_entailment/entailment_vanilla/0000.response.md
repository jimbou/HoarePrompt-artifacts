Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking two conditions:

1.  If n is greater than or equal to m, it means that Nikita has enough moves to add at least m cubes to the tower.
2.  If the difference between n and m (i.e., n - m) is even, it implies that the remaining moves (after adding m cubes) can be used to remove an even number of cubes, which would result in an empty tower or a tower with an even number of cubes.

However, the program's logic is incorrect. The condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 is not sufficient to guarantee that the tower can be built with exactly m cubes. This condition only ensures that the remaining moves can be used to remove an even number of cubes, but it does not consider the actual number of cubes added or removed during those moves.

For example, consider the test case where n = 5 and m = 3. The program would print "YES" because n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0. However, it's not possible to build a tower with exactly 3 cubes after 5 moves, as the moves would result in either 0, 2, or 4 cubes in the tower.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
