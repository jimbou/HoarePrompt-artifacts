Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program checks two conditions:

1.  `n >= m`: This ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach the desired height of the tower.
2.  `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This checks if the difference between the number of moves and the desired height is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes a cube, so the net change in height must be even.

If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
