Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the number of moves is sufficient to build the tower and if the remaining moves can be used to remove cubes from the top of the tower to reach the desired height.

The program works correctly for all possible inputs because it covers all the edge cases:

* If n is less than m, it's not possible to build the tower, so it prints "NO".
* If n is greater than or equal to m, it checks if the remaining moves (n - m) are even. If they are, it means that Nikita can remove cubes from the top of the tower to reach the desired height, so it prints "YES". If they are not, it means that Nikita cannot remove enough cubes to reach the desired height, so it prints "NO".

The program also works correctly for the examples provided in the problem description, and it's not possible to find a counterexample where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
