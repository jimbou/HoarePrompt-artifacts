The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of lines in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `t-1` and `stdin` contains `t-1` lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is equal to `t` and `stdin` contains `t` lines.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is an even number, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is an odd number, then 'NO' is printed.**
