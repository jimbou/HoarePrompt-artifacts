Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the second line of stdin, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100)**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers from the second line of the standard input. The standard input now contains `t-3` lines, each with two integers `n` and `m`, where `1 <= n, m <= 100`.
