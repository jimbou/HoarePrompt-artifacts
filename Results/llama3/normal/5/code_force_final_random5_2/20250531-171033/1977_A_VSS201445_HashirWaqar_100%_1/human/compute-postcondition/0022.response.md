Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the second line of stdin, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
