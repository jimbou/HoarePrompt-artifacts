Output: **`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). The current values of `n` and `m` are such that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and the difference between `n` and `m` is an even number, and 'YES' is printed**
