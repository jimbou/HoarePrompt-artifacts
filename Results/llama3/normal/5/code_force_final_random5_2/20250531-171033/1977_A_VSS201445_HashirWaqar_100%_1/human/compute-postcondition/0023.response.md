Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the last line of stdin, stdin is empty. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n` and `m` will hold the values of the last line of input from stdin. The stdin will be empty because all lines have been processed. The loop will print 'YES' if the last pair of numbers satisfies the condition (n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0), and 'NO' otherwise.
