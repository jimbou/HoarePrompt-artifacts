To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the loop body. However, the `input()` function is used to read a line from stdin.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, and `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the first line of stdin. This means that the first line of stdin has already been read and processed.

For the loop to execute again, there must be another line in stdin to read. Since stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m, we can infer that t-1 > 1, i.e., there are at least two lines in stdin.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the second line of stdin, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100)**

Note that we only adjusted the state of the objects in the loop head, which is the `input()` function and the stdin. We did not modify the state of `n` and `m` explicitly, as they are not part of the loop head. However, we inferred that `n` and `m` will be assigned new values from the second line of stdin.
