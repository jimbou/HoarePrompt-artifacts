Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The given program checks if n is greater than or equal to m and if the difference between n and m is even. This is a correct approach because:

* If n is less than m, it's impossible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves, since the maximum number of cubes that can be added is n.
* If the difference between n and m is odd, it's impossible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves, since each move either adds or removes 1 cube, and an odd number of moves cannot result in an even number of cubes.

The program correctly checks these conditions and prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
