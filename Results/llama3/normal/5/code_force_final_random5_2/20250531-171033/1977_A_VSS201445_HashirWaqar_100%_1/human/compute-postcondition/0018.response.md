Based on the precondition, the values of `n` and `m` are assigned from the second line of stdin, but the actual values are not provided. However, we know that `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

The print statement simply prints the string 'YES'. There are no variables or objects being printed, so the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
