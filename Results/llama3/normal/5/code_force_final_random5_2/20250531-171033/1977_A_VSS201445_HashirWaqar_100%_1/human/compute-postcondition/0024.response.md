Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and m. It then checks if n is greater than or equal to m and if the difference between n and m is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
