Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program checks two conditions:

1.  n >= m: This condition ensures that Nikita has enough moves to build a tower of m cubes.
2.  (n - m) % 2 == 0: This condition checks if the difference between the number of moves (n) and the number of cubes (m) is even. This is necessary because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the difference between n and m must be an even number to ensure that the tower can be built.

If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
