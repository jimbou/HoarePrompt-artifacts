The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to input is an integer that is at least 1 and _ is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) that is at least 1, _ is 0**
