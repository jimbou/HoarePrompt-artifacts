Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `f`, and `k` and adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to make them 0-indexed.
2. It correctly reads the list of integers `a` and sorts it in descending order using the `sort` method with the `reverse=True` argument.
3. It correctly compares the value at index `k` with the value at index `f` (which is stored in the variable `x`) and prints the corresponding result:
	* If `a[k] > x`, it prints 'NO' because the favorite cube will not be removed.
	* If `a[k] < x`, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube will be removed.
	* If `a[k] == x`, it checks if `k == n - 1` or `a[k - 1] < x`. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube will be removed. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
