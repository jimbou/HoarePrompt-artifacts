Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will output "MAYBE", but the correct output should be "YES". This is because the favorite cube has a value of 3, which is the same as the value of the cube at position k (2). In this case, the favorite cube will always be removed, regardless of the order of the cubes with the same value.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the value of the favorite cube is greater than or less than the value of the cube at position k. However, it does not consider the case where the values are equal. In this case, the program should output "YES" if the favorite cube is at position k or to the left of it, and "NO" otherwise.
