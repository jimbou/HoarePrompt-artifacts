The only variables in the loop head are variable _ and the value returned by int(input()). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, the value returned by int(input()) is an integer. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again the value returned by int(input()) must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f, _ is 2, stdin is empty.**
