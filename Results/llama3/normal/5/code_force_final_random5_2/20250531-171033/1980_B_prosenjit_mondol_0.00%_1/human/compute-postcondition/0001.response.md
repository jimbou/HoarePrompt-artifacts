Output State: **n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was input from stdin, and the value of `f` is that integer minus one. The value of `k` is also an integer minus one. The list `a` contains a sorted list of integers in descending order, which were input from stdin. The value of `x` is an integer equal to the value of `a` at index `f` before the list was sorted. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been read.
