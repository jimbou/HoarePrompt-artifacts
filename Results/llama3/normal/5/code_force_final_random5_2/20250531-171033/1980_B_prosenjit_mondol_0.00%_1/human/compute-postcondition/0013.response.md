Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f before sorting, _ is 0, stdin is empty. If the current value of a at index k is greater than the current value of x, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed if a[k] is less than or equal to x.***
