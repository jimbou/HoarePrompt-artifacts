Postcondition: ***n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f, _ is 1, stdin is empty. If the element at index k in the list a is greater than the value of x, 'NO' is printed. If the element at index k in the list a is less than the value of x, 'YES' is printed. If the element at index k in the list a is equal to the value of x, 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n - 1 or the element at index k - 1 in the list a is less than the value of x, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.***
