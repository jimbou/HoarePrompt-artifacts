The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. For each test case, it reads three integers (n, f, k) and a list of n integers, sorts the list in descending order, and compares the value at index k with the value at index f. Based on the comparison, it prints 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' to indicate whether the value at index k is greater than, less than, or equal to the value at index f, respectively. If the values are equal, it also checks if k is equal to n-1 or the value at index k-1 is less than the value at index f to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'MAYBE'.
