The code prints 'YES' if k is equal to n minus one or the element at index k minus one in the list a is less than x, otherwise it prints 'MAYBE'. Where k is an integer minus one, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f, and f is an integer minus one.
Output: **YES if k is equal to n minus one or the element at index k minus one in the list a is less than x, otherwise MAYBE**
