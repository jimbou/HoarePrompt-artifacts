Output State: **n is an integer, f is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f, _ is 1, stdin is empty.**

The code block first assigns new values to `n`, `f`, and `k` from the input, which are integers. Then, it decrements `f` and `k` by 1. After that, it assigns a list of integers to `a` from the input. The value of `x` is set to the element at index `f` in list `a`. Finally, the list `a` is sorted in descending order. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 1, and stdin becomes empty after reading the inputs.
