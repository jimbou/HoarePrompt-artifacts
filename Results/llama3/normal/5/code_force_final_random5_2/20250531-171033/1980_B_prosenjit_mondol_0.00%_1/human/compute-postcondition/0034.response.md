Output State: **n is an integer, f is an integer minus one, k is an integer minus one, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, x is an integer equal to the value of a at index f, _ is equal to the initial value of t, stdin is empty. If a[k] is greater than x, 'NO' is printed. If a[k] is less than x, 'YES' is printed. If a[k] is equal to x, 'YES' is printed if k is equal to n minus one or the value of a at index k minus one is less than x, otherwise 'MAYBE' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being the value of the loop counter _. The loop counter _ will be equal to the initial value of t, which is the number of test cases. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same.
