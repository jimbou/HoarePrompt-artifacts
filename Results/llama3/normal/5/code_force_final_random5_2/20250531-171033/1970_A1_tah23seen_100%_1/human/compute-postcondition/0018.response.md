Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character at index `i` in `s`, `d` is a sorted list of tuples containing `n` key-value pairs: each key `i` maps to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring `s[0:i]`, sorted by the difference and then by the key in descending order and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` and `j` are the first tuple in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the character at index `i` in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
