Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, d is a sorted list of tuples containing n key-value pairs: each key i maps to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring s[0:i], sorted by the difference and then by the key in descending order.
Code of the loop:
for i, j in d:
    ans += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character at index `i` in `s`, `d` is a sorted list of tuples containing `n` key-value pairs: each key `i` maps to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring `s[0:i]`, sorted by the difference and then by the key in descending order and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` and `j` are the first tuple in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` in `s`, `d` is a sorted list of tuples containing `n` key-value pairs: each key `i` maps to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring `s[0:i]`, sorted by the difference and then by the key in descending order and must have at least 2 tuples, `i` and `j` are the second tuple in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` in `s`, `d` is a sorted list of tuples containing `n` key-value pairs: each key `i` maps to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring `s[0:i]`, sorted by the difference and then by the key in descending order and must have at least 3 tuples, `i` and `j` are the third tuple in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
