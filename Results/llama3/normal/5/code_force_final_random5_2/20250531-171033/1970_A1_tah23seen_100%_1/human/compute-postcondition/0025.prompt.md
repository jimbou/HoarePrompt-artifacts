You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, d is a dictionary with n+1 key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the first character of s is "(" or -1 if the first character of s is ")", 2 maps to either 2 if the first character of s is "(" and the second character is also "(", 0 if the first character of s is "(" and the second character is ")", or -2 if the first character of s is ")" and the second character is also ")", and so on, with each key i mapping to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring s[0:i], i is n-1.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is a string consisting of characters at indices i in s, d is an empty list, i and j are undefined.
    return ans
    #The program returns an empty string 'ans' that consists of characters at indices i in a balanced parentheses sequence string 's' of length n.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns an empty string 'ans' that consists of characters at indices i in a balanced parentheses sequence string 's' of length n.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
