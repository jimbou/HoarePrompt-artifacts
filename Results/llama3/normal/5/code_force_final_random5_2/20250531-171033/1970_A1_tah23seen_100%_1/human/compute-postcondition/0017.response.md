According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list d. If the list has at least 1 tuple the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, d is a sorted list of tuples containing n key-value pairs: each key i maps to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring s[0:i], sorted by the difference and then by the key in descending order. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 tuple and the i and j are the first tuple in the list.
State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, d is a sorted list of tuples containing n key-value pairs: each key i maps to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring s[0:i], sorted by the difference and then by the key in descending order and must have at least 1 tuple, i and j are the first tuple in the list**
