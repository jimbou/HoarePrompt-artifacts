Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, d is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 0 maps to 0.**

In this final state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is determined by the length of `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The value of `ans` is an empty string as it is initialized as such. The dictionary `d` contains a single key-value pair where the key 0 maps to the value 0.
