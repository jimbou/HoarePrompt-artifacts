Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with four key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the first character of `s` is "(" or -1 if the first character of `s` is ")", 2 maps to either 2 if the first character of `s` is "(" and the second character is also "(", 0 if the first character of `s` is "(" and the second character is ")", or -2 if the first character of `s` is ")" and the second character is also ")", and 3 maps to either 3 if the first character of `s` is "(" and the second character is also "(", 1 if the first character of `s` is "(" and the second character is ")", or -1 if the first character of `s` is ")" and the second character is also ")" and `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `d[i + 1]` has been updated to `d[i] + 1`, where `i` is 2. The value of `d[3]` is either 3, 1, or -1, depending on the first two characters of `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
