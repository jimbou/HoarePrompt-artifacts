Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, ans is a string consisting of characters at indices i in s, d is an empty list, i and j are undefined.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` remains unchanged, the string `ans` consists of characters at indices `i` in `s`, the list `d` is empty, and the variables `i` and `j` are undefined.
