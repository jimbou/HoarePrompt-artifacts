Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the first character of `s` is "(" or -1 if the first character of `s` is ")", and 2 maps to either 2 if the first character of `s` is "(" or 0 if the first character of `s` is ")", `i` is 1**.

In this output state, the value of `d[i + 1]` has been updated to `d[i] + 1`, where `i` is 1. Since `d[i]` is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`, `d[i + 1]` is now either 2 or 0, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
