To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. Since `s` is not modified in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`.

According to the code, `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The other variables, `n`, `ans`, and `d`, are not modified in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs: 0 maps to 0, 1 maps to either 1 if the first character of `s` is "(" or -1 if the first character of `s` is ")", and 2 maps to either 2 if the first character of `s` is "(" and the second character is also "(", 0 if the first character of `s` is "(" and the second character is ")", or -2 if the first character of `s` is ")" and the second character is also ")", `i` is 2**
