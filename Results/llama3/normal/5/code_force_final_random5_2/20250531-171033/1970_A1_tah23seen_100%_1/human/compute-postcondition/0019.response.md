To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `j`, and `d`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more tuples in the list `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `d` has at least 1 tuple, and `i` and `j` are the first tuple in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `d` must have at least 2 tuples. Since `d` is a sorted list of tuples, the next tuple in the list will have a different difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring `s[0:i]`, or the same difference but a smaller key `i` in descending order.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string consisting of the character at index `i` in `s`, `d` is a sorted list of tuples containing `n` key-value pairs: each key `i` maps to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring `s[0:i]`, sorted by the difference and then by the key in descending order and must have at least 2 tuples, `i` and `j` are the second tuple in the list.**
