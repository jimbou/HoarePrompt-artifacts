Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation some number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping these two parts.

Function 1, `func_1`, checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns 'Yes'. If the array is not sorted, the function checks if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are in the correct order (i.e., the first element is less than or equal to the second element). If such a pair exists, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can become sorted after performing the operation. If no such pair exists, the function returns 'No'.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads input from the standard input, processes the input data, and calls Function 1 for each test case. It then prints the results.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the required logic. Function 1 correctly checks if the array can become sorted after performing the operation, and Function 2 correctly reads input and processes the test cases.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In Function 1, the condition `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` is not necessary. If the array is not already sorted, it is sufficient to check if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are in the correct order. The `any` condition is redundant and can be removed.

Despite this minor issue, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
