To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the value of `t` is greater than the current iteration number.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `data` is a list of strings where each string is either a positive integer or a space-separated list of positive integers
- `index` is `n + 2`
- `t` is at least 1
- `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(arr)` where `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, we don't need to adjust its state. The only object in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the current iteration number. Since `t` is at least 1, we can increment the iteration number by 1. Therefore, `t` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `data`, `index`, and `results` are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where each string is either a positive integer or a space-separated list of positive integers, `index` is `n + 2`, `t` is at least 2, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(arr)` where `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers**
