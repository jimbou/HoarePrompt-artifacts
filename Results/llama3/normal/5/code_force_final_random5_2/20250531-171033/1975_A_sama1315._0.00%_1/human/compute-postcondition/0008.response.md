The code prints a string that is a concatenation of all the elements in the `results` list, separated by newline characters. The `results` list contains the results of `n + 2 + ... + 2n` calls to `func_1(arr)`, where `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers.

Since the exact values of `n` and the integers in `arr` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the results. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string that contains the results of `n + 2 + ... + 2n` function calls, separated by newline characters.

Output: **a string containing the results of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers, separated by newline characters, repeated n + 2 + ... + 2n times**
