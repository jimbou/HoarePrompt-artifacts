Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string is either a positive integer or a space-separated list of positive integers, index is n + 2 + n, t is at least 2, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers, and the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code executes a block of instructions that modify the initial state. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer at the current `index` in the `data` list, which is then incremented by 1. The `arr` variable is created by mapping the next `n` elements in the `data` list to integers, and the `index` is incremented by `n`. The `result` variable is assigned the result of calling the `func_1` function with `arr` as an argument, and this result is appended to the `results` list.

After the code executes, the `data` list remains unchanged, but the `index` has been incremented by `n + 1`. The `t` variable remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the result of calling `func_1` with `arr` as an argument.
