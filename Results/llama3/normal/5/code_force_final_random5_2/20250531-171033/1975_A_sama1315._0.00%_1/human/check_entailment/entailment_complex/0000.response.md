Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times.

Function 1 checks if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order and returns 'Yes' if it is, otherwise returns 'No'. However, this function does not consider the possibility of swapping parts of the array to make it sorted.

Function 2 reads input data from standard input, processes it in batches, and prints the results. For each batch, it applies Function 1 to the list of integers and appends the result to a list of results.

However, Function 2 does not correctly implement the problem statement. It does not consider the possibility of swapping parts of the array to make it sorted. It simply applies Function 1 to the original array and prints the result.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
