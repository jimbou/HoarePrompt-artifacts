Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string is either a positive integer or a space-separated list of positive integers, index is 1, t is a positive integer, results is an empty list.**

The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `data`. The first element of `data` is a positive integer `t`, and the rest of the elements are alternating pairs of a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. The variable `index` is initialized to 0 and then incremented to 1. The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first element of `data`, which is a positive integer. The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list.
