Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times.

Function 1 checks if the input array is already sorted in ascending order. If it is, the function returns 'Yes'. If not, the function checks if the array can be sorted by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. If the array can be sorted, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Function 2 reads the input data, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers. Function 2 calls Function 1 for each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, Function 2 prints the results, one per line.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly checks if the input array is already sorted and if it can be sorted by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The program also correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results as required.

Correctness: **True**
