According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make it explicit, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where each string is either a positive integer or a space-separated list of positive integers, `index` is 1, `t` is at least 1, `results` is an empty list**
