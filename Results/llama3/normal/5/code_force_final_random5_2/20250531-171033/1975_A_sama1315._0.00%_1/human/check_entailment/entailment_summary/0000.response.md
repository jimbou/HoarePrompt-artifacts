Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether an array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.

Function `func_1` checks if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order. If the list is sorted, it returns 'Yes', otherwise, it returns 'No'. However, this function does not consider the operation of splitting and swapping the array.

Function `func_2` reads input data from standard input, processes it in batches, and prints the results. It applies the `func_1` function to each list of integers in the input data and appends the result to a list of results.

However, the problem statement requires the program to determine whether the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation of splitting and swapping. The given program does not consider this operation and only checks if the array is already sorted.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
