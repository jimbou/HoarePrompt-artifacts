Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string is either a positive integer or a space-separated list of positive integers, index is n + 2, t is at least 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers**

The code first converts the string at index 1 in the data list to an integer and assigns it to n. Then, it increments the index by 1. Next, it extracts a sublist of n elements from the data list starting from the current index, converts each string in the sublist to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to arr. The index is then incremented by n. The code then calls the function func_1 with arr as an argument, appends the result to the results list, and assigns the result to the variable result. The value of t remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
