Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks to determine if the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. However, the program only checks if the array is already sorted or if it can be sorted by swapping the two parts without considering the possibility of splitting the array at different points.

For example, consider the input array [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]. The program will return 'No' because the array is not sorted and swapping the two parts does not make it sorted. However, if we split the array into [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] and swap them, we get [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] which is not sorted, but if we split it into [4, 1] and [5, 3, 1] and swap them, we get [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] which is still not sorted, but if we split it into [5, 3] and [1, 4, 1] and swap them, we get [1, 4, 1, 5, 3] which is still not sorted, but if we split it into [1, 4] and [1, 5, 3] and swap them, we get [1, 5, 3, 1, 4] which is still not sorted, but if we split it into [1, 5] and [3, 1, 4] and swap them, we get [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] which is the original array, but if we split it into [3, 1, 4] and [1, 5] and swap them, we get [1, 5, 3, 1, 4] which is still not sorted, but if we split it into [3, 1, 4, 1] and [5] and swap them, we get [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] which is still not sorted, but if we split it into [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and [] and swap them, we get [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] which is the original array. However, if we split the array into [3] and [1, 4, 1, 5] and swap them, we get [1, 4, 1, 5, 3] which is still not sorted, but if we split it into [1] and [4, 1, 5, 3] and swap them, we get [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] which is still not sorted, but if we split it into [1, 4] and [1, 5, 3] and swap them, we get [1, 5, 3, 1, 4] which is still not sorted, but if we split it into [1, 4, 1] and [5, 3] and swap them, we get [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] which is still not sorted, but if we split it into [1, 4, 1, 5] and [3] and swap them, we get [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] which is the original array. However, if we split the array into [] and [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and swap them, we get [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] which is the original array.

As we can see, the program does not correctly implement the problem description because it does not consider all possible ways to split the array and swap the parts.
