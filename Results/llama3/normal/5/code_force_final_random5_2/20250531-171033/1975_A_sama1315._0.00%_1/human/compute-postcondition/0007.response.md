Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string is either a positive integer or a space-separated list of positive integers, index is n + 2 + ... + 2n, t is 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers, and the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers, and ... and the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The `data` list remains unchanged, but the `index` has been incremented by the sum of all the `n` values encountered during the loop iterations. The `t` variable has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The `results` list now contains the results of all the `func_1(arr)` calls, where each `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers.
