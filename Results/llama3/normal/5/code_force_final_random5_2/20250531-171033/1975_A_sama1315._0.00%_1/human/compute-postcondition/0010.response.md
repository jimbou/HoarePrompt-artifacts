Functionality: **Reads input data from standard input, processes it in batches, and prints the results. The input data consists of a series of alternating pairs of a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers. For each pair, the function applies the func_1 function to the list of integers and appends the result to a list of results. Finally, it prints the results, one per line, with each result repeated a number of times equal to the sum of the batch sizes.**
