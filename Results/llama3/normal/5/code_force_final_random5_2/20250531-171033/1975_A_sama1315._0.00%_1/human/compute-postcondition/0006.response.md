Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string is either a positive integer or a space-separated list of positive integers, index is n + 2 + 2n, t is at least 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers, and the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers, and the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers, and the result of func_1(arr) where arr is a list of n positive integers, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers.**

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to a positive integer, which was extracted from the `data` list at the `index` position. The `index` has been incremented by 1 after extracting `n`. Then, a list of `n` positive integers was extracted from the `data` list starting from the updated `index` position, and this list was assigned to `arr`. The `index` was then incremented by `n` to point to the next position in the `data` list. The result of calling `func_1` with `arr` as an argument was appended to the `results` list. The values of `t` and the original contents of the `data` list remain unchanged.
