According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password. If the password has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, password has at least two characters, char is the second character in the password. So for the loop to be executed one more time the password must have at least 3 characters and the char is the third character in the password.
State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least three characters, `char` is the third character in the `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit, the second character of `password` if it is a digit, and the third character of `password` if it is a digit. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit, and the second character of `password` if it is a digit. `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` if it is not a digit, the second character of the `password` if it is not a digit, and the third character of the `password` if it is not a digit.**
