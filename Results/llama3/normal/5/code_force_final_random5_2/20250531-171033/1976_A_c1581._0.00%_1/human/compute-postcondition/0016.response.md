Output State: **`password` is an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string, `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the original `password` string, and `last_digit_index` is -1.**

In this output state, the values of `password`, `digits`, and `letters` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `last_digit_index`, which is assigned the value -1.
