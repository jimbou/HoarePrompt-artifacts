You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: `password` is an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the original `password` string.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `password` is not an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string, `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the original `password` string, and `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'.
    #State: *`password` is not an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string, `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the original `password` string, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string, and the digits in the `digits` list are in ascending order
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'.
    #State: *`password` is not an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string, `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the original `password` string, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string, the digits in the `digits` list are in ascending order, and the letters in the `letters` list are in ascending order
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `password` is not an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string, `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the original `password` string, and `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string.

Case_2: The program returns the string 'NO'.

Case_3: The program returns the string 'NO'.

Case_4: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
