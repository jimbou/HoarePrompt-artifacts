Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character in the `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password`. The first character of the `password` is not a digit**

In this output state, the code has appended the first character of the `password` to the `letters` list. The `password`, `char`, and `digits` remain unchanged. The `letters` list now contains the first character of the `password`, which is a lowercase Latin letter since the first character of the `password` is not a digit.
