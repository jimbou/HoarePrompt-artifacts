Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to verify if a given password meets the conditions for being strong. The conditions are:

*   The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
*   There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
*   All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
*   All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (`t`) and the password for each test case.
2.  It defines a function `func_1(password)` to check if a password is strong.
3.  Within `func_1(password)`, it separates the password into digits and letters using lists.
4.  It checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and updating the `last_digit_index` whenever it encounters a digit. If it finds a letter after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index != -1`), it immediately returns 'NO'.
5.  It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing them with their sorted versions. If either the digits or letters are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
6.  If the password passes all checks, it returns 'YES'.

The program's logic correctly implements the conditions for a strong password. It accurately checks for the presence of digits after letters, verifies the sorting of digits and letters, and handles the case where the password consists only of letters or only of digits.

Correctness: **True**
