Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least three characters, `char` is the third character in the `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit, the second character of `password` if it is a digit, the third character of `password` if it is a digit, and the third character of `password` if it is a digit. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit, the second character of `password` if it is a digit, and the third character of `password` if it is a digit. `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` if it is not a digit, the second character of the `password` if it is not a digit, and the third character of the `password` if it is not a digit.**

In natural language, the output state is: The password remains the same, and the third character of the password is still stored in the variable `char`. The list `digits` now contains the first character of the password if it is a digit, the second character of the password if it is a digit, and the third character of the password if it is a digit. If the third character is not a digit, the list `digits` remains the same. The list `letters` remains the same, containing the first character of the password if it is not a digit, the second character of the password if it is not a digit, and the third character of the password if it is not a digit.
