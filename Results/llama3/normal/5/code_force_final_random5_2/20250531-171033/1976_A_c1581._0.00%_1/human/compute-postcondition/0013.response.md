Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least three characters, `char` is the third character in the `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit, the second character of `password` if it is a digit, and the third character of `password` if it is a digit. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit, and the second character of `password` if it is a digit. `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` if it is not a digit, the second character of the `password` if it is not a digit, the third character of the `password` if it is not a digit, and the third character of the `password` if it is not a digit.**

In this output state, the value of `password` and `char` remains the same. The value of `digits` remains the same because `char` is either a digit or not a digit, and the list `digits` is already defined based on this condition. The value of `letters` is updated to include the third character of the `password` if it is not a digit.
