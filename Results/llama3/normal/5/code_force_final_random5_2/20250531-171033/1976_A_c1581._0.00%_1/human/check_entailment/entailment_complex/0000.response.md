Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly checks the three conditions for a strong password:

1.  All digits in the password must be in ascending order.
2.  All letters in the password must be in ascending order.
3.  There must not be any letters after the last digit in the password.

The program first separates the digits and letters from the password into two separate lists. It then checks if there are any letters after the last digit in the password. If there are, it immediately returns 'NO'. If not, it checks if the digits and letters are in ascending order. If either of them is not, it returns 'NO'. If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
