Postcondition: ***`password` is not an empty string and has at least 3 characters, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string, `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the original `password` string. If the third character in the `password` string is a digit, then `last_digit_index` is 2. If the second character in the `password` string is a digit, then the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no action is taken, `i` is 2 and `char` is the third character in the password.***
