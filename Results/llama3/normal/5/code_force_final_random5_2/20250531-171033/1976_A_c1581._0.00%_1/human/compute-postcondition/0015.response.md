Output State: **`password` is an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the original `password` string.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `password` string will be empty because the loop has processed all its characters. The `digits` list will contain all the digits that were present in the original `password` string, and the `letters` list will contain all the letters that were present in the original `password` string.
