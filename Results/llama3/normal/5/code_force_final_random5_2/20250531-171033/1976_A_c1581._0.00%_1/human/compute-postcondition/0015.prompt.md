Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is an empty list, letters is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in password:
    if char.isdigit():
        digits.append(char)
    else:
        letters.append(char)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character in the `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least two characters, `char` is the second character in the `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit, and the second character of `password` if it is a digit. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit. `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` if it is not a digit and the second character of the `password` if it is not a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least three characters, `char` is the third character in the `password`. `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit, the second character of `password` if it is a digit, and the third character of `password` if it is a digit. `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` if it is not a digit, the second character of the `password` if it is not a digit, and the third character of the `password` if it is not a digit. If `char` is a digit, the third character of `password` is added to `digits`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
