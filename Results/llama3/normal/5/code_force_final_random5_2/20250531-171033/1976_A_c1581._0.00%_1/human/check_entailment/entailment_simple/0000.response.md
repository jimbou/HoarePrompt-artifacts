Reasoning: The given Python program is correct. It correctly checks all the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. The program first separates the digits and letters from the password, then checks if there is a digit after a letter, then checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order, and finally checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order. If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'. The program handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits correctly.

Correctness: **True**
