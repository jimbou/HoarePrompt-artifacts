To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only object in the loop head is the variable `char` and the string `password`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If `password` has at least two characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and `char` is the first character in the `password`.

For the loop to execute again, `password` must have at least two characters, and `char` must be the second character in the `password`. The states of `digits` and `letters` do not affect the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least two characters, `char` is the second character in the `password`, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit, otherwise it is an empty list, `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` if it is not a digit, otherwise it is an empty list**
