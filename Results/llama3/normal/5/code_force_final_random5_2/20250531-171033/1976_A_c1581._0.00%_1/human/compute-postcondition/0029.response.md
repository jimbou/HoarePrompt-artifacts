Postcondition: ***`password` is not an empty string and has at least 2 characters, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string, `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the original `password` string. If the second character in the `password` string is a digit, then `last_digit_index` is 1. If the first character in the `password` string is a digit, then the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
