Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it accurately checks the conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem description. 

1. The program first separates the digits and letters from the password.
2. It then checks if there are any letters after the last digit in the password. If so, it returns 'NO'.
3. Next, it checks if the digits and letters are in ascending order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
4. If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
