To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `char` and the string `password`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If the `password` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, we can adjust its state to ensure it has at least one character.

As for `char`, it will take on the value of the first character in the `password` at the start of the loop.

The states of `digits` and `letters` are not relevant to the loop head, so we cannot adjust them.

State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character in the `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
