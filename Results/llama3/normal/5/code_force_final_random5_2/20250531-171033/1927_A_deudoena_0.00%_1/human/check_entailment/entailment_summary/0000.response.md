Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white. The program reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters.

The program then finds the indices of the first 'B' from the start and end of the string using two separate loops. The first loop iterates through the string from the start and breaks when it encounters the first 'B', storing its index in the variable ind1. The second loop iterates through the string from the end and breaks when it encounters the first 'B', storing its index in the variable ind2.

Finally, the program prints the length of the substring between these two indices (inclusive) using the formula len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1. This formula calculates the length of the substring by subtracting the index of the last 'B' from the end of the string (ind2) and the index of the first 'B' from the start of the string (ind1) from the total length of the string.

The program repeats this process for all t test cases.

Correctness: **True**
