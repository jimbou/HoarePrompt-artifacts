Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: inpstr is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, where t is the value of inpstr
Code of the loop:
for i, j in enumerate(inpstr):
    if j == 'B':
        ind1 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *inpstr is a string or list with at least one element, i is 0, ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, where t is the value of inpstr. If the first element of inpstr is 'B', then j is 'B'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *inpstr is a string or list with at least 2 elements, i is 1, ind1 is 1 if the second element of inpstr is 'B', otherwise ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, where t is the value of inpstr.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *inpstr is a string or list with at least 3 elements, i is 2, j is the value of the third element of inpstr, stdin contains t-1 test cases, where t is the value of inpstr. If j is 'B', then ind1 is 2, otherwise ind1 is 1. ind2 is 0 and outind is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
