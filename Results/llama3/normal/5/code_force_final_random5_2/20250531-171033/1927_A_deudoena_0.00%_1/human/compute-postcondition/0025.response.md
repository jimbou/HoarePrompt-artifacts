Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters. The function then finds the indices of the first 'B' from the start and end of the string, and prints the length of the substring between these two indices (inclusive). The function repeats this process for all t test cases.**
