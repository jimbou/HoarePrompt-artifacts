The code prints the difference between the length of `inpstr` and the index of the first 'B' from the end of `inpstr` minus `ind1`. Since the exact value of `ind1` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated difference.

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where len(inpstr) is the length of inpstr, ind2 is the index of the first 'B' from the end of inpstr, and ind1 is the value of ind1)**
