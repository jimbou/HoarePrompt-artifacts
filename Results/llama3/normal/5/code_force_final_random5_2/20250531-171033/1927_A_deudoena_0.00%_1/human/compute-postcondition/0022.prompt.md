Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: inpstr is a string or list with at least len(inpstr) elements, i is len(inpstr)-1, j is the value of the last element of inpstr, ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in inpstr, ind2 is 0, outind is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, where t is the value of inpstr.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(inpstr)):
    if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
        ind2 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *inpstr is a string or list with at least 1 element, i is 0. If the last element of inpstr is 'B', then ind2 is 0. Otherwise, the program does not specify any changes to ind2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *inpstr is a string or list with at least 2 elements, i is 1. If the second last element of inpstr is 'B', then ind2 is 1. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *inpstr is a string or list with at least 3 elements, i is 2. If the second last element of inpstr is 'B', then ind2 is 2. Otherwise, no change is made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
