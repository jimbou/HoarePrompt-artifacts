The value of `a[i]` is updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`, which is 500, and `x[i - 1]` is `x[0]`, which is an integer. Therefore, `a[i]` is updated to be 500 plus the first element of `x`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 500 and the second element being 500 plus the first element of `x`, and the rest being 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 0**
