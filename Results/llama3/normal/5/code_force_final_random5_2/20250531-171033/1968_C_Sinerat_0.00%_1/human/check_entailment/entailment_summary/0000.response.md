Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and the number of elements in each test case correctly.
2. It initializes the first element of the output list `a` to 500, which satisfies the condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
3. For each subsequent element in the output list, it calculates the value as the sum of the previous element and the corresponding input value `x_i`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` is satisfied, because `a_i` is always greater than `x_i` and `a_{i-1}` is always greater than `a_i`.
4. The program prints the generated list for each test case, which satisfies the output format requirements.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, generating the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
