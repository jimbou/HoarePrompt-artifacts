Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 plus the first element of `x`, the third element being 500 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x`, and the rest being 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which means the third element of `a` is now the sum of the first two elements of `a` and the second element of `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
