The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 500 and the second element being 500 plus the first element of `x`, and the rest being 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 0**
