Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, the third element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, the fourth element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`, the fifth element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]` + `x[3]`, and the rest being 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the current element `x[i-1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `a` now has its fourth element updated to include the sum of the first four elements of `x`.
