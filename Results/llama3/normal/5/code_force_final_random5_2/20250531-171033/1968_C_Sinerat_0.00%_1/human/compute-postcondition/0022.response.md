The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, stdin contains t-n+1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ must be 2 and stdin contains t-n test cases.
State: **`n` is at least n, `i` is n-1, `x` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of x, stdin contains t-n test cases, _ is 2, and the list a is being printed**
