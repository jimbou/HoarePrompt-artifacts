Output State: **n is an integer, i is n-1, x is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 500 and the rest being 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 1**

The code block reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, replacing its initial value. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `x`, replacing its initial value. The list `a` is initialized with `n` zeros, and its first element is set to 500. The rest of the elements in `a` remain 0. The variable `i` is not modified by the code, so it remains `n-1`. The variable `_` is not modified by the code, so it remains 1. Stdin now contains `t-2` test cases.
