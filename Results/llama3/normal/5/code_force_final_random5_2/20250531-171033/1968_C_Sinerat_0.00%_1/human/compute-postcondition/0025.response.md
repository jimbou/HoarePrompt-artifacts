Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 500 and the second element being 500 + x[0] and the rest being 0, `stdin` contains t-n-2 test cases, `_` is 2, and the list `a` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, this means that the second element of `a` is now 500 + x[0]. The other variables remain unchanged.
