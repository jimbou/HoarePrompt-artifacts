Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 plus the first element of `x`, the third element being 500 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x`, the fourth element being 500 plus the first element of `x` plus the second element of `x` plus the third element of `x`, and the rest being 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 3, the value of `i` is still 3, the list `x` remains unchanged with n integers, the list `a` has been updated with the fourth element being the sum of the first three elements of `x` added to 500, and the rest of the elements remain 0. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, and the value of `_` is still 0.
