Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) followed by n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 500
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x` up to the corresponding index, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, _ is 0, and the list `a` is printed, where the first element is 500 and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x` up to the corresponding index

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least n, i is n-1, x is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of x, stdin contains t-n+1 test cases, _ is 1, and the list a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least n, i is n-1, x is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of x, stdin contains t-n-1 test cases, _ is 2, and the list a is being printed, and the list a which is [500, cumulative sum of x[0], cumulative sum of x[0] + x[1], cumulative sum of x[0] + x[1] + x[2], ... , cumulative sum of x[0] + x[1] + x[2] + ... + x[n-1]] is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
