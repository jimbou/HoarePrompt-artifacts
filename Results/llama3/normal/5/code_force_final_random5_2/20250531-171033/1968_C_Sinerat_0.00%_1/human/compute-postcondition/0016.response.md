Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, the third element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and the rest being 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, which is equivalent to `500 + x[0] + x[1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
