The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is a positive integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains a number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the input must be a positive integer and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains a number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases, _ is 0, input() is a positive integer**
