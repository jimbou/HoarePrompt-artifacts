Based on the initial state, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `n` is at least `n`, which means `n` is a non-negative integer.
* `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is one less than `n`.
* `x` is a list of `n` integers.
* `a` is a list of `n` integers, with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of `x`. This means that `a[0] = 500`, and for `i = 1` to `n-1`, `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i]`.
* `stdin` contains `t-n+1` test cases, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* `_` is 1, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(*a)`

The `*` operator is used to unpack the list `a` into separate arguments to the `print` function. This means that the print statement will print the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of `x`, the print statement will print the following:

* The first element of `a`, which is 500.
* The cumulative sum of `x` from the second element to the `n`-th element.

Since we don't know the exact values of `x`, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the cumulative sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first element of `a` (which is 500) followed by the cumulative sum of `x` from the second element to the `n`-th element.

Output: **500, cumulative sum of x from the 2nd element to the nth element (where x is the list of n integers)**
