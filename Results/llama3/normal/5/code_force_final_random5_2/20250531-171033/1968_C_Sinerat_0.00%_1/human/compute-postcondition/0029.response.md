Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, the third element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, the fourth element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]`, the fifth element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]` + `x[3]`, and the rest being 0, `stdin` contains t-n-4 test cases, `_` is 3, and the list `a` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which is equivalent to 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + `x[2]` + `x[3]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
