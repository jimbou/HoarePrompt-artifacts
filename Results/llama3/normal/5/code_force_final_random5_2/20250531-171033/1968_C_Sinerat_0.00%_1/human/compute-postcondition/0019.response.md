Output State: **n is at least n, i is n-1, x is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of x, stdin contains t-n+1 test cases, _ is 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute until `i` reaches `n-1`. At this point, `a` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `x`, starting from the first element. The first element of `a` will be 500, and each subsequent element will be the sum of the corresponding element in `x` and the previous element in `a`. The remaining elements in `a` will be 0. The other variables, `n`, `x`, `stdin`, and `_`, will remain unchanged.
