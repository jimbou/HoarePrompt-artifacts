Output State: **n is at least n, i is n-1, x is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of x, stdin contains t-n-1 test cases, _ is 2, and the list a is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the variable `i` equal to `n-1`, and the list `a` will have its elements updated to be the cumulative sum of the elements in list `x`, starting from the first element of `x` added to 500. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
