The code prints the elements of the list `a`. The list `a` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of the list `x`. Since the exact values of the list `x` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the cumulative sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the list `a` containing the first element 500 and the rest being the cumulative sum of the list `x`.

Output: **[500, (500+x[0]), (500+x[0]+x[1]), ..., (500+x[0]+x[1]+...+x[n-2])] (where x[i] represents the i-th element of the list x)**
