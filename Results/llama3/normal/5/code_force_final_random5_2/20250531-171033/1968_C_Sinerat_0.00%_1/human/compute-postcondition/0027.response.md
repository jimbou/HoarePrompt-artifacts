The value of `a[i]` is updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, `a[2]` is updated to be the sum of `a[1]` and `x[1]`. We know that `a[1]` is 500 + `x[0]` and `x[1]` is an integer. Therefore, `a[2]` is updated to be 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers with the first element being 500, the second element being 500 + `x[0]`, the third element being 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and the rest being 0, `stdin` contains t-n-3 test cases, `_` is 2, and the list `a` is being printed.**
