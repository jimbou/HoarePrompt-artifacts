The code prints the elements of the list `a`. The list `a` is defined as a list of `n` integers, where the first element is 500, and the rest are the cumulative sum of 500 and the elements of `x` up to the corresponding index.

Since the exact values of the elements in the list `x` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the list `a`, which are the cumulative sums of 500 and the elements of `x`.

Output: **[500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-1]] (where x[i] is the ith element of the list x)**
