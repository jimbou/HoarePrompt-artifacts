Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being 500 and the second element being 500 + `x[0]` and the rest being 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the corresponding element `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, this means that the second element of `a` is now 500 + `x[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
