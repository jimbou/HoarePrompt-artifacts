Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is `t-1`, stdin contains 0 lines. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be an integer between 1 and 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will still be integers between 0 and 9. The variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The stdin will be empty, containing 0 lines, since all input lines have been processed. The print statements will still follow the same conditions as before, printing 'STAIR' if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'PEAK' if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.
