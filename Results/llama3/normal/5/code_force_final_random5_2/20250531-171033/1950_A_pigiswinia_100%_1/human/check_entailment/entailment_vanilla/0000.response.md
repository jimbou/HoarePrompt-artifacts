Reasoning:

1. The problem statement clearly defines the conditions for a "stair" and a "peak". A stair requires that a < b < c, while a peak requires that a < b > c.
2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks the conditions for a stair and a peak using simple if-elif-else statements.
4. If the condition for a stair is met (a < b < c), the program prints "STAIR".
5. If the condition for a peak is met (a < b > c), the program prints "PEAK".
6. If neither condition is met, the program prints "NONE".
7. The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
