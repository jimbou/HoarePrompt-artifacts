Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated to the three integers read from the first line of the input, which contains three digits. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing three digits, since one line has been read. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are still valid, but the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated.
