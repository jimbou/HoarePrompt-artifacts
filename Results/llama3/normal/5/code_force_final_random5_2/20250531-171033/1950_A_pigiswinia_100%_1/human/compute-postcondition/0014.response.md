Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
