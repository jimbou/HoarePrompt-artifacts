Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three digits. Either `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`. The current value of `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.**
