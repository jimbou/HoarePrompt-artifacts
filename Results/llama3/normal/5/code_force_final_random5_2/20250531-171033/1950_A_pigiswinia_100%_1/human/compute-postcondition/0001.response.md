According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
