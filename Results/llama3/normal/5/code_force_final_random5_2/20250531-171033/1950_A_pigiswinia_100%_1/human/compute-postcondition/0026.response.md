Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing three digits. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i` and the condition for printing 'STAIR', 'PEAK' or 'NONE' remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to be integers between 0 and 9, which are read from the first line of the input. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing three digits, since one line has been read.
