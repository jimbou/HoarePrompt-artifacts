Based on the initial state, the code will print the string 'PEAK' because the current value of `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, which satisfies the condition for printing 'PEAK'. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are not relevant to the output of the print statement.

Output: **PEAK**
