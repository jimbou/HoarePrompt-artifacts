The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). After reading the first input integer, the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
