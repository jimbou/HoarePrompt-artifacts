Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly identifies whether the given three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c) and prints the corresponding output. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The program handles all possible cases, including when the digits are equal, and the output matches the problem description.
