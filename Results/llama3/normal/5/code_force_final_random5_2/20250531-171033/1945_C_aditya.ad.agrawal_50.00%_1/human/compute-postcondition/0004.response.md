Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, z_r is the number of 0s in arr, o_r is the number of 1s in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, b_d is the absolute value of n/2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values except for b_d, which is assigned the value of dist, which is the absolute value of n/2. The relationship between o_r, z_r, and o_r remains the same, with o_r being greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r.
