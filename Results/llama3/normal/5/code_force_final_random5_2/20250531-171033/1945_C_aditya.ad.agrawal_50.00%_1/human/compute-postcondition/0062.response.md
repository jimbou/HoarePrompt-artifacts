Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and has at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr plus two, i is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If i is 0, then z is the number of 0s in arr minus one, and z_l is the number of 0s in arr on the left side plus one, and z_r is the number of 0s in arr on the right side minus one. Otherwise, o_l is incremented by 1, and o_r is decremented by 1.**
