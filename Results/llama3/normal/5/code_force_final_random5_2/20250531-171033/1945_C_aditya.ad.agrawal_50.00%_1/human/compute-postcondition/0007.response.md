Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, z_r is the number of 0s in arr, o_r is the number of 1s in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, then b_d is the absolute value of n/2. Otherwise, o_r is less than (z_r + o_r) / 2 and b_d is 30001.***
