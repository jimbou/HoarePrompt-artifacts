Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and has at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the length of arr plus two, pos is the length of arr plus two, i is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - (the length of arr plus two), z_l is the number of 0s in arr on the left side, z_r is the number of 0s in arr on the right side, o_l is the number of 1s in arr on the left side, o_r is the number of 1s in arr on the right side.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans` and `b_d`. The first line assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`, making `ans` equal to the length of `arr` plus two. The second line calculates the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`, and assigns this value to `b_d`. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The values of `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and `o_r` are not directly modified by the code snippet, but their values can be inferred based on the values of `z`, `o`, and the elements of `arr`.
