This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It then processes each test case by iterating through the string, maintaining counts of 0s and 1s on the left and right sides of the current position. The function finds the position where the conditions o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 are first met, and prints this position. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
