Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr minus 1 if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the length of arr plus 3, pos is the length of arr plus 3, i is the third element in the list, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - (the length of arr plus 3), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and if the third element in the list is 1, then o_l is o_l plus 1 and o_r is o_r minus 1.**
