Output State: **t is an integer (3 <= t <= 3*10^5), n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, z_r is the number of 0s in arr, o_r is the number of 1s in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, o_r is less than (z_r + o_r) / 2, and b_d is 30001.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `b_d` is introduced with the value 30001. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties, including the relationships between them.
