Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus one if the second element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` if the second element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0 if the second element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list if it exists, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, then `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2`. Otherwise, `o_r` is less than (`z_r` + `o_r`) / 2 and `b_d` is 30001.***
