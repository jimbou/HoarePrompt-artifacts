Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is first met, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the last element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 1 element, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr plus 1, i is the first element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i is 0, then z is the number of 0s in arr minus 1, and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 or 30001 depending on the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2. If i is not 0, then o_l is incremented by 1, and o_r is decremented by 1. Additionally, the number of 1s on the right side of the current position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 1s and 0s on the right side, the number of 0s on the left side of the current position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 0s and 1s on the left side, and the distance between the current position and the middle of the array is greater than the absolute difference between the middle of the array and the current position.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr plus 2, i is the second element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i is 0, then z is the number of 0s in arr minus 1, and b_d is either the absolute value of n/2 or 30001 depending on the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2. If i is not 0, then o_l is incremented by 1, and o_r is decremented by 1. Additionally, the number of 1s on the right side of the current position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 1s and 0s on the right side, the number of 0s on the left side of the current position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 0s and 1s on the left side, and the distance between the current position and the middle of the array is greater than the absolute difference between the middle of the array and the current position. If the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)) is met, then ans is the length of arr plus 2, pos is the length of arr plus 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to ans and pos.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr minus 1 if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)), then ans is the length of arr plus 3, pos is the length of arr plus 3, i is the third element in the list, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - (the length of arr plus 3), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and if the third element in the list is 1, then o_l is o_l plus 1 and o_r is o_r minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
