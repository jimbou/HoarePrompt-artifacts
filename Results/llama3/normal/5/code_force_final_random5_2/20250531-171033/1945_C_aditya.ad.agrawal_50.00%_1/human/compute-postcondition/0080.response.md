Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is first met, `pos` is the length of `arr` plus 1, `i` is the first element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `i` is 0, then `z` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, and `b_d` is either the absolute value of `n/2` or 30001 depending on the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`. If `i` is not 0, then `o_l` is incremented by 1, and `o_r` is decremented by 1.***
