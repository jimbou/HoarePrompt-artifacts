Output State: **`n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is first met, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the last element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2 - (the length of arr)`, and if the last element in the list is 1, then `o_l` is `o_l` plus 1 and `o_r` is `o_r` minus 1, and the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is first met which is `ans` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and the length of `input_string` has also been reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
