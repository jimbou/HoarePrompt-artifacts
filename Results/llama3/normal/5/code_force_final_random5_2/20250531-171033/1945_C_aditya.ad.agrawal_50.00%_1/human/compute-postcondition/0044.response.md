Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, z_r is the number of 0s in arr minus one, o_r is the number of 1s in arr, z_l is 1, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr plus one, i is the first element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, then b_d is the absolute value of n/2. Otherwise, b_d is 30001 and the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met is being printed. The current value of i is 0.**

The code increments `z_l` by 1 and decrements `z_r` by 1. As a result, `z_l` becomes 1, and `z_r` becomes the number of 0s in `arr` minus one. No other variables are affected.
