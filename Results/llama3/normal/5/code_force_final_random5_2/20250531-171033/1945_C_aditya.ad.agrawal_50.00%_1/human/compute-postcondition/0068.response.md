Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr, i is the last element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four. If the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)) is met, then ans is the position where the condition is first met, and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - the position where the condition is first met, z_l is the number of 0s in arr on the left side, z_r is the number of 0s in arr on the right side, o_l is the number of 1s in arr on the left side, o_r is the number of 1s in arr on the right side, and the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met is being printed**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables are still valid, and the position where the condition is first met is still being printed.
