Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and has at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr minus one, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr plus two, i is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, z_l is the number of 0s in arr on the left side plus one, z_r is the number of 0s in arr on the right side minus one.**

The code modifies the values of `z_l` and `z_r`. The first line increments `z_l` by 1, and the second line decrements `z_r` by 1. The value of `z` is reduced by 1 because `z_r` is decremented. The values of `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `o`, `dist`, `ans`, `pos`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
