Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 4 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, z_r is the number of 0s in arr minus one if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in arr minus two, o_r is the number of 1s in arr if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 1s in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise it is 2, o_l is 1 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 3, i is the fourth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, ans is 0, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 3.**

The code increments `o_l` by 1 and decrements `o_r` by 1. The value of `o_l` is now 1 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise it is 1. The value of `o_r` is now the number of 1s in arr if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 1s in arr minus two. The values of `ans` and `b_d` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
