Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus one if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0 if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `pos` is 2, `i` is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n/2` minus `pos`, then `ans` is 1 and `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2` minus 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `pos` being 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans` and `b_d` are still dependent on the values of `o_r`, `z_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, and `b_d`, but the value of `pos` has been updated.
