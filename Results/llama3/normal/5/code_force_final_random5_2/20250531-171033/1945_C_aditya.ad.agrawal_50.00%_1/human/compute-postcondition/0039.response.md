Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5, `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is first met, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the last element in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `b_d` is 30001, and the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is first met is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `b_d` has been updated to 30001. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
