Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 3 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr plus 3, i is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, o_l is o_l + 1, o_r is o_r - 1.**

The code modifies the values of `o_l` and `o_r`. The first line increments `o_l` by 1, and the second line decrements `o_r` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
