Output State: **`n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is first met, `pos` is the length of `arr` plus 2, `i` is the second element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `i` is 0, then `z` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, and `b_d` is either the absolute value of `n/2` or 30001 depending on the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`. If `i` is not 0, then `o_l` is incremented by 1, and `o_r` is decremented by 1. Additionally, the number of 1s on the right side of the current position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 1s and 0s on the right side, the number of 0s on the left side of the current position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 0s and 1s on the left side, and the distance between the current position and the middle of the array is greater than the absolute difference between the middle of the array and the current position.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `pos` has been incremented by 1, making it the length of `arr` plus 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
