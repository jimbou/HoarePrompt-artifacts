Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 1 element, z is the number of 0s in arr minus 1, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr plus 1, the current value of i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, then b_d is the absolute value of n/2. Otherwise, b_d is 30001.**

The code modifies the values of `z_l` and `z_r`. The first line increments `z_l` by 1, and the second line decrements `z_r` by 1. The value of `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, which is now `z - 1` because `z_r` has been decremented. The value of `o` remains unchanged. The value of `dist` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `ans` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `pos` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
