Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only 0s and 1s.

2. It initializes variables to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s in the string, as well as variables to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s on the left and right sides of the road.

3. It initializes a variable `dist` to the absolute value of `n/2`, which represents the distance from the middle of the village. It also initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the position where the condition is first met.

4. It checks if the initial state of the right side of the road satisfies the condition, and if so, sets `b_d` to `dist`. Otherwise, it sets `b_d` to a large value (30001).

5. It then iterates over the string `a`, updating the counts of 0s and 1s on the left and right sides of the road. For each position, it checks if the condition is met, and if so, updates `ans` and `b_d` if the current position is closer to the middle of the village.

6. Finally, it prints the position `ans` where the condition is first met.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
