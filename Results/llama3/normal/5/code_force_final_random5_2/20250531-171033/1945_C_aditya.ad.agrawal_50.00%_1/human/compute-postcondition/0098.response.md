Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr, i is the last element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, b_d is the absolute value of n/2 - (the length of arr), and if the last element in the list is 1, then o_l is o_l plus 1 and o_r is o_r minus 1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The position `pos` is now equal to the length of the list `arr`, and the last element `i` is the last element in the list. The value of `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2` minus the length of `arr`. If the last element in the list is 1, then `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
