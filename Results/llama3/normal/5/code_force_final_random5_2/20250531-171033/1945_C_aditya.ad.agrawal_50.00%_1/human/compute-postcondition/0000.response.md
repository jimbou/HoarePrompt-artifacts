The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer that is assigned to `t`. The second input, a string of 0s and 1s, is still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (3 <= t <= 3*10^5), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a string a of length t, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
