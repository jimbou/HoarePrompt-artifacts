Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 3*10^5, `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus one, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 1, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is first met, `pos` is the length of `arr` plus one, `i` is the second element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2` minus the length of `arr` minus one. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `pos` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for updating `b_d` are still the same, but the value of `pos` has changed, which may affect the result of the conditions.
