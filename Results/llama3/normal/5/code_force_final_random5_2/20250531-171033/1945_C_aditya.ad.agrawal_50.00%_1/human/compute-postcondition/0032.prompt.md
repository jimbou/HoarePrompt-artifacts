Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, z_r is the number of 0s in arr, o_r is the number of 1s in arr, z_l is 0, o_l is 0, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is 0, pos is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, then b_d is the absolute value of n/2. Otherwise, o_r is less than (z_r + o_r) / 2 and b_d is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, `n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus one if the second element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` if the second element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0 if the second element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `pos` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list if it exists, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n/2` minus `pos`, then `ans` is 1 and `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2` minus 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, z_r is the number of 0s in arr minus one if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in arr minus two, o_r is the number of 1s in arr if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 1s in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise it is 2, o_l is 0 if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 2, i is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, and z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 minus pos, then ans is 1 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 2. Otherwise, ans remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 4 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, z_r is the number of 0s in arr minus one if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in arr minus two, o_r is the number of 1s in arr if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 1s in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise it is 2, o_l is 0 if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 3, i is the fourth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If i is 0, then z_r is the number of 0s in arr minus two if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in arr minus three, o_r is the number of 1s in arr if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 1s in arr minus one, z_l is 2 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise it is 3, o_l is 0 if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, and z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 minus pos, then ans is 1 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 3. Otherwise, ans remains 0. If i is not 0, then ans is 0 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
