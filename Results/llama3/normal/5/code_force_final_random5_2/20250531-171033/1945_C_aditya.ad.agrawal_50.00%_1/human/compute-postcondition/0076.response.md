Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `input_string` is a string of length `t` consisting only of 0 and 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n/2`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is first met, `pos` is the length of `arr` plus 1, the current value of `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is the absolute value of `n/2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.**
