Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5, n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and must have at least 2 elements, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, z_r is the number of 0s in arr minus one if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 0s in arr minus two, o_r is the number of 1s in arr if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is the number of 1s in arr minus one, z_l is 1 if the third element in the list is 1, otherwise it is 2, o_l is 0 if the third element in the list is 0, otherwise it is 1, dist is the absolute value of n/2, pos is 2, i is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If o_r is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_r and o_r, and z_l is greater than or equal to half of the sum of z_l and o_l, and b_d is greater than the absolute value of n/2 minus pos, then ans is 1 and b_d is the absolute value of n/2 minus 2. Otherwise, ans remains 0.***
