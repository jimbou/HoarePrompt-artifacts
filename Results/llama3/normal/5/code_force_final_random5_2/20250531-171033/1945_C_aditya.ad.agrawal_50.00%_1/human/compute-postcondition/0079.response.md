Output State: **n is an integer, input_string is a string of length t consisting only of 0 and 1, arr is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and is not empty and must have at least 1 element, z is the number of 0s in arr, o is the number of 1s in arr, dist is the absolute value of n/2, ans is the position where the condition o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos) is first met, pos is the length of arr plus 1, i is the first element in the list and is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. o_l is incremented by 1, o_r is decremented by 1.**

The code increments `o_l` by 1 and decrements `o_r` by 1. The value of `o_l` is now one more than its original value, and the value of `o_r` is one less than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
