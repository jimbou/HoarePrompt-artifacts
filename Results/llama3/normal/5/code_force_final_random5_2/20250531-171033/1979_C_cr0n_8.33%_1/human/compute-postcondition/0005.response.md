The only variable in the loop head is variable  r and list vals, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the vals.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, vals has at least 0 elements, r is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 1 element and the r is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive.
State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `N` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `prod` is an integer between 4 and 400 inclusive, `r` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive**
