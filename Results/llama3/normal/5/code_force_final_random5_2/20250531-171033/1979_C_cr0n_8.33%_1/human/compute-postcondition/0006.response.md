Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `N` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `prod` is an integer between 8 and 8000 inclusive, `r` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive**

The code multiplies the value of `prod` by `r`. Since `prod` is initially between 4 and 400 inclusive, and `r` is between 2 and 20 inclusive, the new value of `prod` will be between 8 (4*2) and 8000 (400*20) inclusive. The values of `stdin`, `N`, `vals`, and `r` remain unchanged.
