Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `N` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 0 elements, `prod` is an integer between 4 and 400 inclusive, `r` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive.**

In this output state, the value of `prod` has been updated to be the product of its original value and `r`. Since `prod` was originally between 2 and 20 inclusive, and `r` is also between 2 and 20 inclusive, the new value of `prod` is between 4 and 400 inclusive. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
