The code multiplies the value of `prod` by `r`. The value of `prod` is initially 1, and `r` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive. Therefore, the new value of `prod` is the product of 1 and `r`, which is equal to `r`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one, `N` is still an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `vals` is still a list of `N` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 1 element.

Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `N` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `prod` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive, `r` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive.**
