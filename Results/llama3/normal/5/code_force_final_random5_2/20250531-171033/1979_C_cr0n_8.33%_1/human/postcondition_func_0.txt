This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It reads an integer N and a list of N integers, calculates the product of the integers, and then calculates the quotient of the product divided by each integer. If the sum of these quotients is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the list of quotients. The function does not return any value.
