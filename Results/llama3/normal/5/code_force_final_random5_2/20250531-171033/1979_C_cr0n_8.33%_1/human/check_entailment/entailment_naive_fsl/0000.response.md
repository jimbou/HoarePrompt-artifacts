Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The strategy is to calculate the product of all the multipliers and then divide it by each multiplier to get the amount of coins to bet on each outcome. The denominator is then calculated as the product minus the sum of the amounts to bet on each outcome. If the denominator is less than or equal to 0, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the amounts to bet on each outcome.

The program correctly handles all the cases, including the edge cases where the number of outcomes is 1 or where the multipliers are all the same. It also correctly handles the case where the denominator is less than or equal to 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
