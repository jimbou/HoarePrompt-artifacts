Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (N) and the multipliers for each outcome.
3. It calculates the product of all multipliers, which is used to determine the bets for each outcome.
4. It calculates the quotient of the product divided by each multiplier, which represents the bet for each outcome.
5. If the sum of these quotients is less than or equal to 0, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, so it prints -1.
6. Otherwise, it prints the list of quotients, which represents the bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of the product and quotient calculations ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
