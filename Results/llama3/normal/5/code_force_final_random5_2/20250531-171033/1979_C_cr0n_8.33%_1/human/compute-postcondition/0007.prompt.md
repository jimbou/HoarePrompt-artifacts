Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of N integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod is 1
Code of the loop:
for r in vals:
    prod *= r


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `N` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `prod` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive, `r` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `N` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 0 elements, `prod` is an integer between 4 and 400 inclusive, `r` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `vals` is a list of `N` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `prod` is an integer between 8 and 8000 inclusive, `r` is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
