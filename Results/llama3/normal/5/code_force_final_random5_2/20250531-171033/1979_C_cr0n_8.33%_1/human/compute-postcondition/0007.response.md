Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is an empty list, prod is an integer between 2^N and 20^N inclusive, r is an integer between 2 and 20 inclusive.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one, the value of `N` remains unchanged, the list `vals` is now empty because all its elements have been processed, the product `prod` has been updated to a value between 2 raised to the power of `N` and 20 raised to the power of `N` (inclusive), and the variable `r` still holds an integer value between 2 and 20 (inclusive).
