Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, calculates the product of the multipliers, and then calculates the quotient of the product divided by each multiplier. If the sum of these quotients is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the list of quotients, which represents the bets on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the product of the multipliers and the quotients, and it correctly checks if the sum of the quotients is less than or equal to 0. If the sum is less than or equal to 0, it correctly prints -1. Otherwise, it correctly prints the list of quotients.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The program assumes that the input values are valid, i.e., the number of outcomes is between 1 and 50 inclusive, and the multipliers are between 2 and 20 inclusive. If the input values are not valid, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

Therefore, the correctness of the program depends on the assumption that the input values are valid. If this assumption is true, the program is correct. Otherwise, the program may be incorrect.

Correctness: **True**
