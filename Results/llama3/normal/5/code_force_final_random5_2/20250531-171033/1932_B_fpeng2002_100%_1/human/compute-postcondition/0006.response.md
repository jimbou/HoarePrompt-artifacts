Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is `nums[1]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[1]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 1**

The code updates the value of `start_year` by dividing it by `nums[x]` (which is `nums[1]` since `x` is 1), rounding down to the nearest integer, adding 1, and then multiplying the result by `nums[x]` (which is `nums[1]`). This effectively rounds `start_year` up to the nearest multiple of `nums[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
