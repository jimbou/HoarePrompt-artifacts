The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, num_tests is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, n is an integer and must be at least 1, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least n elements, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases, x is n-1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the x is 0.
State: **num_tests is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, n is an integer and must be at least 1, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases, x is 0**
