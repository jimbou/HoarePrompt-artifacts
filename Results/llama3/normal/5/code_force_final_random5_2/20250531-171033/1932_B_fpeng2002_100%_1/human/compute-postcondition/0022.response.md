The code prints the value of `start_year` which is calculated based on the elements of the `nums` list. The `start_year` is calculated as ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // ... // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], where `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least n elements.

Output: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least n elements, `start_year` is ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // ... // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is n-1, and the start year is printed**
