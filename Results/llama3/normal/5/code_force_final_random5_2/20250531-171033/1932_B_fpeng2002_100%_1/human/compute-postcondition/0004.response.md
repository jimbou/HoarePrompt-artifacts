Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `nums[0]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[0]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to the original value of `start_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
