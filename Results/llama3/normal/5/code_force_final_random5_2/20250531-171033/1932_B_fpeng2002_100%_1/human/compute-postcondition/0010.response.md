The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is calculated as `nums[n-1]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[n-1]`. 

Since `nums[n-1]` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and `start_year` is an integer, the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[n-1]` is the ceiling of the division of `start_year` by `nums[n-1]`. 

Therefore, `start_year` is equal to `nums[n-1]` times the ceiling of the division of `start_year` by `nums[n-1]`.

Output: **nums[n-1] times the ceiling of the division of start_year by nums[n-1]**
