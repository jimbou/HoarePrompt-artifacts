Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program iterates through each sign's periodicity, updating the start year to be the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading the number of test cases and the signs' periodicities from standard input and printing the result for each test case.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading test cases from standard input and printing the results.

Correctness: **True**
