The code prints the value of `start_year`, which is calculated based on the elements of the list `nums`. The calculation involves a series of operations, including integer division, multiplication, and addition, using the elements of `nums` in a specific order.

The value of `start_year` depends on the values of `nums`, which is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `start_year` value, which is a result of the complex calculation involving the elements of `nums`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the calculated value based on the elements of the list nums)**
