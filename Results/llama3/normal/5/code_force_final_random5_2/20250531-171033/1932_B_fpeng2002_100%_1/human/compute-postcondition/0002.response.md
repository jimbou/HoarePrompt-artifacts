Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases.**

The code first decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1, reducing its range to between 0 and 999 inclusive. Then, it reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The next line reads `n` integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to `nums`, which is now a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The last line initializes `start_year` to 0. The remaining test cases in stdin are reduced by 1, now containing `num_tests - 1` test cases.
