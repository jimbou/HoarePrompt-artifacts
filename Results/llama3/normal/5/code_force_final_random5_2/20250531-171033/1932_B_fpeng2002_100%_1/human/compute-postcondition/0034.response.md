Output State: **num_tests is 0, n is an integer and must be at least 1, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least n elements, start_year is equal to (((...(((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] ... // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], x is n-1, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the start_year is printed which is equal to (((...(((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] ... // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of tests (`num_tests`) is reduced to 0, the number of integers (`n`) and the list of integers (`nums`) remain unchanged, the start year is calculated based on the last set of integers in the list, the loop counter (`x`) is set to the last index of the list, there are no more test cases in the standard input (`stdin`), and the calculated start year is printed.
