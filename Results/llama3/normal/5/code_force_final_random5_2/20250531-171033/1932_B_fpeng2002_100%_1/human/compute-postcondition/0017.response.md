Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated based on the given formula, which involves the values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `start_year` is now a new value calculated using the previous value of `start_year` and the values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.
