Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is equal to (((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `x` is 2, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be equal to (((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], which is a new combination of the values of `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
