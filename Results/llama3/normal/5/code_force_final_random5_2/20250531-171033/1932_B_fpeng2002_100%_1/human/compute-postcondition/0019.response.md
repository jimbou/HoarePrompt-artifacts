Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 3 elements, `start_year` is ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the previous value of `start_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
