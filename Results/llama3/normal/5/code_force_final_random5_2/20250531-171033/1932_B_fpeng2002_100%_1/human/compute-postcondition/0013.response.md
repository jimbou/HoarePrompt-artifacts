Output State: **num_tests is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, n is an integer and must be at least 1, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least n elements, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 1 test cases, x is n-1**

The code snippet provided modifies the initial state in the following ways:

- The first line decrements `num_tests` by 1, reducing its value within the range of 0 to 998 inclusive.
- The second line updates `n` to an integer value obtained from the input, ensuring it is at least 1.
- The third line reassigns `nums` to a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, ensuring it has at least `n` elements.
- The fourth line resets `start_year` to 0.
- The value of `x` is updated to `n-1` based on the new value of `n`.
- The stdin now contains `num_tests - 1` test cases.

All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
