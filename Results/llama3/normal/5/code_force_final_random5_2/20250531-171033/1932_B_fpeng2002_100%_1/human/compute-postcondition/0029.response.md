To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1, and `nums` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is equal to ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 2, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases.**
