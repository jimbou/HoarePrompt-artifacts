The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. 

After executing the code, the value of `num_tests` is assigned the value of the first integer in the stdin, which is t. 

The remaining input in the stdin is still valid and contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
