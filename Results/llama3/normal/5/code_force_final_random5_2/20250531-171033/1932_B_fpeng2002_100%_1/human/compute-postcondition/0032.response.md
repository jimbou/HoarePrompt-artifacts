The code prints the value of `start_year` which is calculated by iteratively applying a formula to the elements of the `nums` list. The formula involves integer division, multiplication, and addition. The calculation starts with 0 and iteratively applies the formula to each element of the `nums` list, from the first element to the second last element.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the result of the iterative calculation involving the elements of the nums list)**
