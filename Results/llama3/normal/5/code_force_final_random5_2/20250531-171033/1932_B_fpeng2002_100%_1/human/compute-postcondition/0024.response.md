Output State: **num_tests is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, n is an integer and must be at least 1, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least n elements, start_year is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases, x is n-1.**

The first line decrements `num_tests` by 1, reducing its value. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, replacing its previous value. The third line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `nums`, replacing its previous value. The fourth line sets `start_year` to 0, replacing its previous value. The value of `x` is not affected by the code. Stdin now contains `num_tests - 2` test cases.
