Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the provided periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then enters a loop that runs for each test case.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).

3. It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the current sign will occur.

4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the year in which the sign will occur by using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that the sign occurs in the next year that is a multiple of its periodicity, but strictly after the previous sign has occurred.

5. After calculating the year for all signs, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
