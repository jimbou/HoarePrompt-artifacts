Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

The program calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur by iterating through the list of periodicities and updating the start year accordingly. The start year is calculated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which ensures that the start year is the next multiple of the current periodicity after the previous start year.

The program correctly handles the case where the start year is 0, which is the initial value before the first iteration. In this case, the start year is set to the first periodicity, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

The program also correctly handles the case where the periodicities are 1, which is a special case where the start year does not change.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
