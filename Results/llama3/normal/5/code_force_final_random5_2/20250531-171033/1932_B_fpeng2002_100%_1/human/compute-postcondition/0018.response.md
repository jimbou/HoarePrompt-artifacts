The only variable in the loop head is variable x and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and nums. If x is less than the length of nums, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 1, nums has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, x must be increased by 1, so x is 2 and for the loop to execute again nums must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 3 elements, `start_year` is ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**
