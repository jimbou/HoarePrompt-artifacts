The only variable in the loop head is variable num_tests, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num_tests.  If num_tests is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num_tests is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, So for the loop to be executed one more time num_tests must be greater than 0.
State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least `n`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least `n` elements, `start_year` is `nums[n-1]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[n-1]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is `n-1`, and the value of `start_year` which is `nums[n-1]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[n-1]` is being printed**
