Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is equal to ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]), `x` is 0, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be equal to ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]), which is equivalent to `nums[0]` because (0 // nums[0] + 1) will always be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
