To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`

The objects in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `x` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` has at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, and `nums` still needs to have at least 1 element.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is equal to ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]), `x` is 1, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases.**
