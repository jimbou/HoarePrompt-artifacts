Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least `n`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least `n` elements, `start_year` is `nums[n-1]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[n-1]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `num_tests` remains unchanged, `n` is still an integer but must be at least as large as the number of iterations, `nums` is still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive but must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `start_year` is updated to be `nums[n-1]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[n-1]`, `stdin` still contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, and `x` is now `n-1`.
