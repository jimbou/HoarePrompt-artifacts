Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least n elements, `start_year` is ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // ... // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is n-1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the `start_year` variable, which has been updated to be the result of the loop's execution. The `start_year` is now the result of the expression `((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // ... // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1]`, which represents the result of the loop's execution for all `n` iterations. The other variables, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
