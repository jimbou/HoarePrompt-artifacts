To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `x` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` has at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 1. The length of `nums` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]), `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 1**
