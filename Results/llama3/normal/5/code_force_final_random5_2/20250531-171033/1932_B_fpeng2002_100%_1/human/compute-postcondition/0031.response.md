Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least n elements, `start_year` is equal to (((...(((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] ... // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], `x` is n-1, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `num_tests` is still greater than 0 but has been reduced by 1, `n` remains an integer and at least 1, `nums` remains a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive with at least n elements, `start_year` has been updated to the result of the repeated calculation involving all elements of `nums`, `x` has reached n-1, and stdin still contains num_tests - 2 test cases.
