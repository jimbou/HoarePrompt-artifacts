To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `nums`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` has at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 1. The length of `nums` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is `nums[0]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[0]`, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 1**
