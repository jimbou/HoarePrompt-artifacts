The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. This range already ensures that `num_tests` is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
