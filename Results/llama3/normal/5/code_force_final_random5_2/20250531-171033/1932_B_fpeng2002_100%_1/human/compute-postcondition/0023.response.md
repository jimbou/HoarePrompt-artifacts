According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive. This does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `num_tests` is greater than 0.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least n elements, `start_year` is ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // ... // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1], `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is n-1, and the start year is printed**
