Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is `nums[2]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `nums[1]` times the smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[1]` divided by `nums[2]` plus 1, `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated based on the given formula. The smallest integer greater than or equal to `start_year / nums[1]` is multiplied by `nums[1]` and then divided by `nums[2]`, and the smallest integer greater than or equal to this result is multiplied by `nums[2]` to get the new value of `start_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
