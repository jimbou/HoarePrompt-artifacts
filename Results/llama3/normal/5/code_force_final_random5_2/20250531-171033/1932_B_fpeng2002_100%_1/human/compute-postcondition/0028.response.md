Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is equal to ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 1, stdin contains num_tests - 2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated based on the value of `nums[1]`. The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
