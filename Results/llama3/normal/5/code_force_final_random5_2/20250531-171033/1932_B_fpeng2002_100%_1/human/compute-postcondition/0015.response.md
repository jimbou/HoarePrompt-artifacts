Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is an integer and must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]), `stdin` contains `num_tests` - 1 test cases, `x` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `start_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `start_year` can be calculated as ((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]), which is equivalent to `nums[0]` because (0 // nums[0] + 1) is always 1. Therefore, `start_year` is now equal to `nums[0]`.
