Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0' and `n` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is the value of `ans` after the last iteration plus `n` plus 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '1', then `n` is the value of `n` after the last iteration plus 1. Otherwise, the values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
