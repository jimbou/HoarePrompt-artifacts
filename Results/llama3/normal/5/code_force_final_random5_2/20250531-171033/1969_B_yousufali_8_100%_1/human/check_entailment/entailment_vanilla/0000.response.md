Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a binary string `s` as input and initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of consecutive '1's and `ans` to store the total cost. It then iterates through the string, incrementing `n` whenever it encounters a '1'. When it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it increments `ans` by `n + 1`, which represents the cost of shifting the substring of '1's to the right of the current '0'.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The reasoning behind the correctness of the program is as follows:

* The program correctly identifies the substrings of '1's that need to be shifted to the right of the '0's to make the string sorted.
* The cost of shifting each substring is correctly calculated as the length of the substring (`n + 1`).
* The program accumulates the costs of all necessary shifts to obtain the total cost.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. When the string starts with one or more '1's, the program does not account for the cost of shifting these '1's to the right of the first '0'. This is because the `n` variable is only incremented when a '1' is encountered, but it is not reset when a '0' is encountered. As a result, the program undercounts the total cost in such cases.

Correctness: **False**
