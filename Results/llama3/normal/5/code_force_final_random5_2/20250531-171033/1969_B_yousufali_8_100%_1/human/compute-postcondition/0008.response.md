Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is `t-1`, a function named func_1 has been called and returned, func_1 has been called `t-1` more times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` will be between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), indicating that all the test cases have been processed. The stdin will contain the remaining `t` lines of binary strings. The loop counter `_` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The function `func_1` will have been called and returned `t` times, with the last call being the `t-th` iteration.
