Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0, a function named func_1 has been called.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The value of `_` is still 0. Additionally, a function named `func_1` has been called, but since its implementation is not provided, its effects on the state are unknown.
