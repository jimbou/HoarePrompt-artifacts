Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1` takes a binary string as input and calculates the sum of the counts of consecutive '1's preceding each '0', plus one for each '0' that is not the first character and is preceded by at least one '1'. This function seems to be calculating the minimum cost to make the string sorted.

Function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input, followed by `t` lines of binary strings, and calls `func_1` for each line.

The key observation here is that `func_1` is not actually calculating the minimum cost to make the string sorted. It is only counting the number of consecutive '1's preceding each '0' and adding one for each '0' that is not the first character and is preceded by at least one '1'. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to find the longest increasing subsequence of '1's and '0's in the string, and then calculate the minimum cost to make the string sorted by performing cyclic shifts on the substrings.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
