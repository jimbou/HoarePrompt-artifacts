Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is `t-1`, a function named func_1 has been called and returned, func_1 has been called `t-1` more times.

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), indicating that all input lines have been processed. The variable `_` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The function `func_1` will have been called and returned `t` times, and the stdin will contain `t` lines, each with a binary string `s` of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).
