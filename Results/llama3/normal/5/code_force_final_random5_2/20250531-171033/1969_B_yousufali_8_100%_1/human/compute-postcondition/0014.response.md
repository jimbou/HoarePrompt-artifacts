Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `n` is the value of `n` after the last iteration plus 1, `ans` is the value of `ans` after the last iteration**

The code increments the value of `n` by 1, so the new value of `n` is the previous value plus 1. The values of `s`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
