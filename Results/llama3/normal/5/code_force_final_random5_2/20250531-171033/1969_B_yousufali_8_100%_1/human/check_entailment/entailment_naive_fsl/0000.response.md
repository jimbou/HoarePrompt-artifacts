Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks for the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. However, the program only checks for the presence of '1's and '0's in the string and calculates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before a '0'. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual cost of performing the cyclic shifts.

For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The correct solution would be to perform a cyclic shift on the substring "10" to get "01", which has a cost of 1.

The program does not correctly handle cases where the string has multiple '1's and '0's, and it does not consider the optimal way to perform the cyclic shifts to minimize the cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
