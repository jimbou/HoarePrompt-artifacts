Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 takes a binary string as input and calculates the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that is not the first character and is preceded by at least one '1', where `n` is the number of '1's in the string. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to count the number of '1's in the string and then calculate the minimum cost to move all '1's to the left of all '0's. This can be done by counting the number of '0's that are preceded by at least one '1' and adding the length of the substring that needs to be shifted to move all '1's to the left of all '0's.

Function 2 reads an integer `t` from standard input, followed by `t` lines of binary strings, and calls Function 1 for each line. Since Function 1 is incorrect, Function 2 is also incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
