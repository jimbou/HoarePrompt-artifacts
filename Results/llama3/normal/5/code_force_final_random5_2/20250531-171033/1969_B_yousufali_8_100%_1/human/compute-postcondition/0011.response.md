Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by `n + 1`, where `n` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is increased by `n + 1`, where `n` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '1'. This means that if the character at index `i` in `s` is '1', then `ans` is increased by `n + 2`, otherwise, it is increased by `n + 1`. The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.
