Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 1, a function named func_1 has been called and returned, func_1 has been called one more time.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same, between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t-2` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), because one line has been read and processed by the function `func_1`. The value of `_` remains 1. The function `func_1` has been called and returned, and it has been called one more time.
