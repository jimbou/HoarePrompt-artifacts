The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 2, a function named func_1 has been called and returned, func_1 has been called one more time.**
