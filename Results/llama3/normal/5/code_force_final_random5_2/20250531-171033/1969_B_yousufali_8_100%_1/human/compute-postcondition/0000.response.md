The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5). The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5).**
