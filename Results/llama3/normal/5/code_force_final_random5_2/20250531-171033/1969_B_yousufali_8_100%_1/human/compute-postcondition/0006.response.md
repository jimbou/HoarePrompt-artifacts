Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing a binary string `s` (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 2, a function named func_1 has been called and returned, func_1 has been called two more times.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing a binary string `s`, because two lines have been consumed by the two calls to `func_1`. The value of `_` remains 2, as it is not affected by the code. The function `func_1` has been called two more times, in addition to the previous call, so it has been called a total of three times.
