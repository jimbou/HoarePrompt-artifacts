The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that is not the first character and is preceded by at least one '1'. Here, `n` is the number of '1's in `s`.

Output: **the sum of (n+1) for each '0' in s that is not the first character and is preceded by at least one '1' (where n is the number of '1's in s)**
