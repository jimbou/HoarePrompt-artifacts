Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 takes a binary string `s` as input and calculates the minimum total cost. It iterates through the string, counting the number of '1's (`n`) and adding `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`) whenever it encounters a '0' that is not the first character and is preceded by at least one '1'. This is because the optimal strategy is to shift the '1's to the left of the '0's, and the cost of each shift is equal to the number of '1's plus one.

Function 2 reads the number of test cases `t` and calls Function 1 for each test case.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for solving the problem. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
