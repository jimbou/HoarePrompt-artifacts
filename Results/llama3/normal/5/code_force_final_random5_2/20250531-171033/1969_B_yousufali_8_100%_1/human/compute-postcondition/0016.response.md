Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `ans` is the value of `ans` after the last iteration plus `n` plus 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '1', then `n` is the value of `n` after the last iteration plus 1, otherwise, the value of `n` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains unchanged, the index `i` remains at 2, and the value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `n` plus 1. The value of `n` is incremented by 1 only if the character at index `i` in `s` is '1', otherwise, it remains unchanged.
