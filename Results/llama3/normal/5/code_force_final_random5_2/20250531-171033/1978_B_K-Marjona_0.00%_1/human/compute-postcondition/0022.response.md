Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n which is equal to a*n is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first k numbers in the range [b-k+1, b] plus the product of (n-k) and a is being printed.***
