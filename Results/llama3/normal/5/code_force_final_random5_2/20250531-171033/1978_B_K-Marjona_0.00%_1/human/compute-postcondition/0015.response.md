Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first k terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from b - k + 1 with a common difference of 1 is printed, plus the product of the remaining n - k terms and a.***
