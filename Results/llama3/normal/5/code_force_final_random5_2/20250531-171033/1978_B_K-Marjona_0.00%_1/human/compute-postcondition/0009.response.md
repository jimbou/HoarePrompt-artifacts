The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input. So for the loop to be executed one more time, stdin must contain t lines of input and int(input()) must be at least 1.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, stdin contains t lines of input**
