Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. If b is larger than a, the sum of the first k terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term b - k + 1 and common difference 1, plus the product of the number of remaining terms (n - k) and the first term a is printed.**
