To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `_` (a throwaway variable), `range`, and `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) that is greater than 0. Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).**
