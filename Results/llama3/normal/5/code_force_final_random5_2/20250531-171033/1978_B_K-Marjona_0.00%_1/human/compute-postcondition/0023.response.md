Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, stdin is empty. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first k terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from b - k + 1 with a common difference of 1 is printed, plus the product of the remaining n - k terms and a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the input from stdin will be exhausted, and the loop will have processed all the input lines. The values of n, a, and b will still be within their specified ranges, and k will still be the minimum of n and b - a. The output will be the result of the calculations performed in the loop, which depends on the relationship between a and b. If b is less than or equal to a, the output will be the product of a and n. If b is greater than a, the output will be the sum of the first k terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from b - k + 1 with a common difference of 1, plus the product of the remaining n - k terms and a.
