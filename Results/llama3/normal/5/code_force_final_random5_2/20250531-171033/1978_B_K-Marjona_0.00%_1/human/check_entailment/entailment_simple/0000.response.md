Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

2. The program calculates the value of `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This is correct because `k` represents the number of buns sold at the modified price, which cannot exceed the number of buns available (`n`) or the difference between the modified price and the usual price (`b - a`).

3. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the program prints the product of `a` and `n`, which is the total profit when all buns are sold at the usual price. This is correct because in this case, selling all buns at the usual price maximizes the profit.

4. If `b` is greater than `a`, the program calculates the profit by summing the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b - k + 1` with a common difference of 1, and adding the product of the remaining `n - k` terms and `a`. This is correct because the first `k` buns are sold at the modified price, and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price.

5. The formula used to calculate the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence is correct. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula `(n * (a1 + an)) / 2`, where `n` is the number of terms, `a1` is the first term, and `an` is the last term. In this case, `n` is `k`, `a1` is `b - k + 1`, and `an` is `b`.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

Correctness: **True**
