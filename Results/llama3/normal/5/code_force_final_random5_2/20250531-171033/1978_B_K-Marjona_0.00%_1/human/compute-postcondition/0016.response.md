The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If there is at least one more line of input in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains `t - 1` lines of input. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least `t` lines of input.

State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n and b - a, stdin contains t lines of input**
