The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, `k`, and `n`. 

The expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `k` terms, where the first term is `b - k + 1` and the last term is `b`. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula `n * (a1 + an) / 2`, where `n` is the number of terms, `a1` is the first term, and `an` is the last term. In this case, `n` is `k`, `a1` is `b - k + 1`, and `an` is `b`. 

The expression `(n - k) * a` calculates the product of `n - k` and `a`.

The entire expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a` adds the sum of the arithmetic series and the product of `n - k` and `a`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, `k`, and `n`.

Output: **the result of the mathematical expression involving the variables a, b, k, and n**
