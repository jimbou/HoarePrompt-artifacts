Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total cost for each case. For each test case, it calculates the cost based on the given integers n, a, and b. If b is less than or equal to a, it prints the product of a and n. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the first k terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from b - k + 1 with a common difference of 1, plus the product of the remaining n - k terms and a, and prints the result. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, leaving stdin empty.**
