The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mid and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is greater than `n/2`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `mid + 2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `mid + 2`. Also, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, so `mid` is not changed.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s`, `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is 1, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `tleftZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne`, `trightZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne` minus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftZero`, `trightOne` is `tleftOne` plus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is `tleftOne`, `right` is `n`, `t` is not changed, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `mid + 2`.**
