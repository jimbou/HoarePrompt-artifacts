Postcondition: ***n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 0, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 0. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne plus 1, trightZero is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne. Otherwise, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus 1, trightZero is n minus 1, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 1.***
