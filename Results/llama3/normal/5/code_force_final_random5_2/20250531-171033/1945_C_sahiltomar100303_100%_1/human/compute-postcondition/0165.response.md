Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `mid`, `tleftZero` is less than half of `right + 1`, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right + 1`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.***
