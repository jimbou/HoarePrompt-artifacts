Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus one if s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of string s minus one if s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus two if s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus one, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of string s minus two if s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the second half of string s minus one, and right is less than n and not equal to n-1 and s[right+1] is '0', or right is not equal to 0 and s[right+1] is not '0'.**

The first line increments `leftOne` by 1. The second line decrements `rightOne` by 1. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `right` remain unchanged. The value of `leftOne` is now the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` plus two if `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` plus one. The value of `rightOne` is now the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` minus two if `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` minus one.
