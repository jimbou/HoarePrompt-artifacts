Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` plus the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` plus the number of '1's in the second half of string `s`, `rightOne` is 0, and `right` is `n`.

The loop will continue to execute until `right` is no longer less than `n` or the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` is no longer true. At this point, all '0's and '1's in the second half of the string will have been moved to the first half, and `right` will be equal to `n`.
