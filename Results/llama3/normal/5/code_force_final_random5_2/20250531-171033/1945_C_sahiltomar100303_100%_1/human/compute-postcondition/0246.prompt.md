Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s, rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than `n/2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s`, `rightZero` is 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `tleftZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne`, `trightZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne` minus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftZero`, `trightOne` is `tleftOne` plus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is `tleftOne`, `right` is `n`, `t` is not changed, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `mid`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than `n/2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s`, `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is 1, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0, `tleftZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne`, `trightZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne` minus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftZero`, `trightOne` is `tleftOne` plus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is `tleftOne`, `right` is `n`, `t` is not changed, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `mid + 1`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2, otherwise `rightOne` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s`, `rightZero` is 3 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is 2 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '1', otherwise it is 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '1' and the character at index `i` is '1', otherwise it is 2, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is 2 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '1' and the character at index `i` is '1', otherwise it is 1, `tleftZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne`, `trightZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne` minus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftZero` if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '1' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftZero` minus 1, `trightOne` is `tleftOne` plus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is `tleftOne` if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftOne` plus 2, `right` is `n`, `t` is not changed, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `mid + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
