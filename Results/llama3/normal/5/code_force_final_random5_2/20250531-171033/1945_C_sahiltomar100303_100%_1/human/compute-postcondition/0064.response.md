Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` has less than (`mid` + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of `s` has less than (`n` - `mid` + 1) // 2 '1's, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and `left` is less than `right` - 1 and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is equal to `mid` + 2, `leftZero` is less than or equal to (`left` + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is less than (`n` - `left` + 1) // 2, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and `rightZero` is decremented by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is incremented by 1, and `rightOne` is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `right` being equal to `mid` + 2. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships.
