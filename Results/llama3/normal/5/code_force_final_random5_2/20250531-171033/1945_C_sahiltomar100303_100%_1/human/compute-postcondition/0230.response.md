Postcondition: ***n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 2, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 2. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, leftOne and tleftOne are each incremented by 1.***
