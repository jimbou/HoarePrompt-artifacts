Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is at least 2, i is 2. If s[i] is '0', leftZero and tleftZero are incremented by 1. If s[i] is '1', leftOne and tleftOne are incremented by 1.***
