Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s has less than (mid + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of s has less than (n - mid + 1) // 2 '1's, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is equal to n, left is greater than 0, leftMove is 0. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '0', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is one more than the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s minus one, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '1', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s plus one, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s minus one, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the exception that leftOne has been decremented by 1 and rightOne has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
