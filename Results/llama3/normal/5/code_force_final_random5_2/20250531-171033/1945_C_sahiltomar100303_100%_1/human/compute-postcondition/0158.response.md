Output State: **The loop executes until `left` is less than or equal to 0 or the conditions `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` are no longer true.**

In natural language, the loop continues to execute until it reaches the end of the string (`left` is less than or equal to 0) or until the number of '0' characters in the first half of the string (`leftZero`) is no longer less than half of the remaining characters in the first half, or until the number of '1' characters in the second half of the string (`rightOne`) is no longer less than half of the remaining characters in the second half.
