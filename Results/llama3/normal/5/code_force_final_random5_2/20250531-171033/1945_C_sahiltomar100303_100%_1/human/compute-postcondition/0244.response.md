Output State: **n is an integer greater than mid + 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s, rightZero is 2 if the character at index mid of string s is '0' and the character at index i is '0', otherwise it is 1, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is 2 if the character at index mid of string s is not '0', otherwise it is 1, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is n minus tleftOne minus 1 if the character at index mid of string s is '0', otherwise it is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne plus 2 if the character at index mid of string s is not '0', otherwise it is tleftOne plus 1, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid + 2.**

In this output state, the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` have been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
