Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid, based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The program iterates through the string from both ends, keeping track of the number of 0s and 1s on the left and right sides, and updates the 'left' and 'right' indices accordingly. It then prints the value of either 'left' or 'right' based on certain conditions, ensuring that the road is laid as close to the middle of the village as possible while satisfying the conditions.

Correctness: **True**
