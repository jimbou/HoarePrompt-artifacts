Output State: **right = n, tleftZero = n - tleftOne, trightZero = tleftZero, trightOne = tleftOne.**

The loop continues to execute until `right` is no longer less than `n` or the conditions `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` are no longer true. After each iteration, `right` is incremented by 1, and the values of `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are updated based on the value of `s[right - 1]`. The loop terminates when `right` is equal to `n` or when the conditions `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` are no longer true. At this point, `right` is equal to `n`, and the values of `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are updated based on the final value of `right`.
