Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is equal to n, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, and trightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of s, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` has less than (`mid` + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of `s` has less than (`n` - `mid` + 1) // 2 '1's, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, and `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `leftMove` is 0, and the character at index `left` - 1 in string `s` is either '0' or '1'. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'. If `s[left - 1]` is '1', then `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s` minus one, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` plus one.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` has less than (`mid` + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of `s` has less than (`n` - `mid` + 1) // 2 '1's, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is equal to `mid` - 2, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left` - 1 in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` plus one, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'. If the character at index `left` - 1 in string `s` is '1', then `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s` minus one, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus one, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s` minus one, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` plus one, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s has less than (mid + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of s has less than (n - mid + 1) // 2 '1's, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is equal to n, left is greater than 0 and less than the previous value by 1, leftMove is 0. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '0', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2 minus one, rightZero is one more than the number of '0's in the second half of s plus one, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '1', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2 minus one, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s plus one plus one, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s minus one, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '0', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is one more than the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s minus one, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '1', then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s plus one, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s minus one, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
