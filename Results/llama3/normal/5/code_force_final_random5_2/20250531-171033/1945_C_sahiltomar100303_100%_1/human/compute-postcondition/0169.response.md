Output State: **n is greater than right, tleftZero is less than half of right, tleftOne is less than half of right plus one, trightOne is less than half of n - right minus one**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than `right`, as neither of these variables is modified by the code. The value of `tleftZero` also remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, making it less than half of `right` plus one. The value of `trightOne` is decremented by 1, making it less than half of `n - right` minus one.
