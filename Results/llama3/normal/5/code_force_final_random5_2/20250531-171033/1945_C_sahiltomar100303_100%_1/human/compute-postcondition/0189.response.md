Postcondition: **right equals n, tleftZero equals n minus tleftOne, trightZero equals tleftZero, trightOne equals tleftOne, the current value of left is 0, and right is equal to n. If the current value of rightOne is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of left which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is n is being printed.**
