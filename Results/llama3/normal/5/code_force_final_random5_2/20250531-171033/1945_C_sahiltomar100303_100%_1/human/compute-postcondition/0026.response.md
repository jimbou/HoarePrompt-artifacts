Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is less than n, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, rightZero is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '1', otherwise rightOne is 0, tleftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, trightZero is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise trightZero is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, and trightOne is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '1', otherwise trightOne is 0, rightOne is incremented by 1, and trightOne is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `rightOne` and `trightOne` is now 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', otherwise it is 0.
