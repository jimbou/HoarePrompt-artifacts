Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is mid, leftMove is 0, i is n.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1 if the character at `mid - 1` index in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` remains the same, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at `mid - 1` index in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` remains the same, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 1, `left` is `mid - 2` and greater than -1, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`. If the character at `left - 1` index in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1 if the character at `mid - 1` index in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` remains the same and less than (`mid - 1 + 1`) // 2, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` and less than (`n - (`mid - 1`) + 1`) // 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at `mid - 1` index in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` remains the same, `leftOne` is one less than the original value, `rightOne` is one more than the original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is greater than 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 2, left is mid - 3 and greater than -1, leftMove is 0, i is n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s. If the character at left - 1 index in s is '0', then leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s minus 2, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus 2. Otherwise, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s minus 1 if the character at mid - 1 index in s is '0', otherwise leftZero remains the same and less than (mid - 1 + 1) // 2, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s and less than (n - (mid - 1) + 1) // 2, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus 1 if the character at mid - 1 index in s is '0', otherwise rightZero remains the same, leftOne is one less than the original value, rightOne is one more than the original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
