Output State: **right is equal to n, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is 0, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the right pointer has reached the end of the string, and the number of zeros in the left half is less than half of the total length of the string. The number of zeros in the right half is 0, indicating that all zeros have been moved to the left half. The number of ones in the left half is equal to the total number of ones in the string, and the number of ones in the right half is 0. The current value of the character at the left pointer is '1'.
