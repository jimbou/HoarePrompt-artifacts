Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than n/2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of string s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of string s, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is n minus tleftOne minus the number of '0's in the second half of string s, trightOne is tleftOne plus the number of '1's in the second half of string s, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is n, left is mid, leftMove is 0
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than `n/2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` and must be less than half of `left`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` and must be less than half of `n - left + 1`, `tleftZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne`, `trightZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne` minus the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, `trightOne` is `tleftOne` plus the number of '1's in the second half of string `s`, `right` is `n`, `t` is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is '1', then the current value of the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is '1'. Otherwise, the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is not '0', `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` minus one, and `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` plus one.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than `n/2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2. If the character at index `left - 2` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid - 1` minus one, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s` plus one, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` minus one, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - (mid - 2) + 1`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid - 1`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` minus two, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - (mid - 2) + 2`. In both cases, `tleftZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne`, `trightZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne` minus the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, `trightOne` is `tleftOne` plus the number of '1's in the second half of string `s`, `right` is `n`, `t` is not changed, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n`, `left` is `mid - 3`, and `leftMove` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is at least 8, `s` is a string, `mid` is at least 4, `left` is greater than -1. If `s[left]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value, `rightZero` is one more than its original value, and `rightOne` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value, and `leftZero` and `rightOne` must satisfy the loop condition.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
