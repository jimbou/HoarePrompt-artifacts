Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of string s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of string s, right is mid
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right+1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right+1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, and `right` is less than or equal to `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is 0, `right` is increased by 1, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus two if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus one if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', or it is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus one if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string s minus two if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it is the number of '0's in the second half of string s minus one if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', or it is the number of '0's in the second half of string s minus one if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus one if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it remains the same if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is '0', or it is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus two if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus one if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is '0', `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string s minus one if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it remains the same if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is '0', or it is the number of '1's in the second half of string s minus two if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the second half of string s minus one if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is '0', and `right` is less than `n` and not equal to `n-1` and `s[right+1]` is '0', or `right` is not equal to 0 and `s[right+1]` is not '0'.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is 0, `right` is increased by 1 and less than `n-1`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` plus two if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[right+1]` is '0', otherwise it is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[right+1]` is not '0', or it is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[right+1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same and less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s` minus two if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[right+1]` is '0', otherwise it is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[right+1]` is not '0', or it is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[right+1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[right+1]` is '0', or it is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` plus two if `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[right+1]` is '0', `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[right+1]` is '0', or it is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` minus two if `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[right+1]` is '0' and less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, and `right` is less than `n` and not equal to `n-1` and `s[right+1]` is '0', or `right` is not equal to 0 and `s[right+1]` is not '0'.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
