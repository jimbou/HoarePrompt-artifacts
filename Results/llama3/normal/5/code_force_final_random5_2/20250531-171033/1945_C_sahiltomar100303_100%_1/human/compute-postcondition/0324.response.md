Functionality: **This function takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It then calculates the indices 'left' and 'right' based on the number of 0s and 1s in the string, and prints the value of either 'left' or 'right' based on certain conditions. If 'left' is 0, it prints 'right' if 'right' is not equal to n, or prints 'left' if 'right' is equal to n and the number of 1s on the right is less than half of n, or prints 'right' if 'right' is equal to n and the number of 1s on the right is greater than or equal to half of n. If 'left' is not 0, it prints 'left' if 'right' is equal to n and the number of 0s on the left is less than half of n, or prints 'right' if 'right' is equal to n and the number of 0s on the left is greater than or equal to half of n, or prints the value that is closer to the middle index of the string if 'right' is not equal to n.**
