Output State: **n is an integer greater than n/2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of string s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of string s, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is n minus tleftOne minus the number of '0's in the second half of string s, trightOne is tleftOne plus the number of '1's in the second half of string s, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is n, left is mid, leftMove is 0**

The code assigns the value of `mid` to `left` and the value of `0` to `leftMove`. No other variables are affected. The values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `right`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
