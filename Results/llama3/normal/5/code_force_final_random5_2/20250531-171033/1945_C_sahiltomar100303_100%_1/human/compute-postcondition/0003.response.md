To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `mid`. The loop will execute if `mid` is at least 1, since `range(mid)` needs to have at least one element to iterate over.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is at least 1, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is 0**
