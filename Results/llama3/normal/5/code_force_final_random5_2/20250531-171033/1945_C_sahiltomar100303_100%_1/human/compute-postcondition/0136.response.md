Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to mid + 3, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 3 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is 3 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 2, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, stdin contains no inputs, i is mid + 2**

The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was 2 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, it becomes 3 if `s[i]` is '0' and 2 otherwise. Similarly, `trightZero` becomes 3 if `s[i]` is '0' and 2 otherwise. No other variables are affected.
