Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` has less than (`mid` + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of `s` has less than (`n` - `mid` + 1) // 2 '1's, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, and `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `leftMove` is 0, and the character at index `left` - 1 in string `s` is either '0' or '1'. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'. If `s[left - 1]` is '1', then `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s` minus one, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` plus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The character at index `left` - 1 in string `s` is either '0' or '1', and the counts of '0's and '1's in the first and second halves of `s` are updated accordingly.
