Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, right is n, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne, _ is increased by 1, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 0, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 0. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne plus 1, trightZero is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne. Otherwise, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus 1, trightZero is n minus 1, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 1. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 2, leftOne is 0, rightZero is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne plus 2, trightZero is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne. If the character at index i of string s is '1', then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 2, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus 2, trightZero is n minus 2, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 2, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 2. If the character at index i in string s is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, leftOne and tleftOne are each incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
