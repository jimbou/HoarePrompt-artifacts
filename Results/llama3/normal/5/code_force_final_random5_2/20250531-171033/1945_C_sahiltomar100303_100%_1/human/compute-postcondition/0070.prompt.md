Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s has less than (mid + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of s has less than (n - mid + 1) // 2 '1's, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is equal to n, left is greater than or equal to 0, leftMove is 0, right is equal to mid. If left is greater than 0, then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'. If left is 0, then leftZero is 0, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` has less than (`mid` + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of `s` has less than (`n` - `mid` + 1) // 2 '1's, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is less than `right` - 1 and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is equal to `mid` + 1. If `left` is greater than 0, then `leftZero` is less than (`left` + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is less than (`n` - `left` + 1) // 2, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'. If `left` is 0, then `leftZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is less than (`n` - `left` + 1) // 2 minus 1 if `s[right]` is '1', otherwise `rightOne` is less than (`n` - `left` + 1) // 2, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` has less than (`mid` + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of `s` has less than (`n` - `mid` + 1) // 2 '1's, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and `left` is less than `right` - 1 and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is equal to `mid` + 2, `leftZero` is less than or equal to (`left` + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` minus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is less than (`n` - `left` + 1) // 2, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and `rightZero` is decremented by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is incremented by 1, and `rightOne` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` has less than (`mid` + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of `s` has less than (`n` - `mid` + 1) // 2 '1's, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `left` is greater than 0 and `left` is less than `right` - 1 and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is equal to `mid` + 3. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1, and `rightZero` is decremented by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is incremented by 1, and `rightOne` is decremented by 1. In both cases, `leftZero` is less than (`right` + 1) // 2, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1'.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
