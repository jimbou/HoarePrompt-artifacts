Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to mid + 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 2 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is 2 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, stdin contains no inputs, i is mid + 1**

The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` and `trightZero` were initially 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise they were 0, they now become 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise they remain 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
