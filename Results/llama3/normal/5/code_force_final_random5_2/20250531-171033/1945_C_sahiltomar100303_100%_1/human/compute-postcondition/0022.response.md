Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is less than n, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is 1, tleftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, and trightOne is 1, and the character at index i of string s is '1'**

The code increments the value of `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1. Since the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented to 1. No other variables are affected.
