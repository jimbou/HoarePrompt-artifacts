Output State: **n is an integer greater than mid + 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s, rightZero is 3 if the character at index mid of string s is '0' and the character at index i is '0', otherwise it is 2, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is 1 if the character at index mid of string s is not '0', otherwise it is 0, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is n minus tleftOne minus 1 if the character at index mid of string s is '0', otherwise it is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne plus 1 if the character at index mid of string s is not '0', otherwise it is tleftOne, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid + 2.**

The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. The value of `rightZero` is now 3 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is 2. The value of `trightZero` is now `n` minus `tleftOne` minus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftZero`. No other variables are affected.
