To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the variable `mid`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `mid`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `mid` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `mid` remains the same, which is at least 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is at least 2, `i` is 2**
