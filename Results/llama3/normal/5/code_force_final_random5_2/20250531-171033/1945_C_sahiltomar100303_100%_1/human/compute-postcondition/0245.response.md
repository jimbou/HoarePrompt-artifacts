Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s`, `rightZero` is 3 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is 2 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '1', otherwise it is 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '1' and the character at index `i` is '1', otherwise it is 2, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is 0 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is 2 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '1' and the character at index `i` is '1', otherwise it is 1, `tleftZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne`, `trightZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne` minus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftZero` if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '1' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftZero` minus 1, `trightOne` is `tleftOne` plus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is not '0', otherwise it is `tleftOne` if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0' and the character at index `i` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftOne` plus 2, `right` is `n`, `t` is not changed, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `mid + 2`.**
