Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and greater than 2, left is mid - 2 and greater than 0, leftMove is 0, i is n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s. If the character at left - 1 index in s is '0', then leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s minus 2, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus 2. Otherwise, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s minus 1 if the character at mid - 1 index in s is '0', otherwise leftZero remains the same and less than (mid - 1 + 1) // 2, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s and less than (n - (mid - 1) + 1) // 2, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s plus 1 if the character at mid - 1 index in s is '0', otherwise rightZero remains the same, leftOne is one less than the original value, rightOne is one more than the original value.***
