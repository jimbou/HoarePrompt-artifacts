Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, mid is at least 2, s is a string, stdin contains no inputs, leftZero is 2, tleftZero is 2, leftOne is 1, tleftOne is 1**

The code increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially 1 and `tleftZero` was also initially 1, they both become 2 after the execution of the code. No other variables are affected by the code.
