Output: **right is not equal to n, tleftZero = n - tleftOne, trightZero = tleftZero, trightOne = tleftOne, left is not equal to 0, and the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is strictly larger than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right, and the value of right is being printed**
