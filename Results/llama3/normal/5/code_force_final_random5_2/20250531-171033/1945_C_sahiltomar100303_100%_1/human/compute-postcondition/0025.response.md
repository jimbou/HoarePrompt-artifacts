Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is less than n, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, rightZero is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '1', otherwise rightOne is 0, tleftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s plus 1, trightZero is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise trightZero is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, and trightOne is 1 if the character at index i of string s is '1', otherwise trightOne is 0**

The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. The value of `rightZero` and `trightZero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0. Since `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1, their new values will be 2 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise they will remain 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
