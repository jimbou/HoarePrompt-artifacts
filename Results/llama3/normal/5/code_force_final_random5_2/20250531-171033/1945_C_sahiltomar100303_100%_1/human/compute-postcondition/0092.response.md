Output: **right is equal to n, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is 0, the current value of s[left - 1] is '1', and left is equal to 0. Additionally, the current value of right is equal to n. The current value of tleftZero is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of right which is equal to n is being printed**
