Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 0, mid is at least 1, s is a string, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, stdin contains no inputs. The current value of s[i] is '0'.**

The code increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially 0, it becomes 1, and since `tleftZero` was also initially 0, it also becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `s[i]` remains '0' as it is not modified by the code.
