Output State: **`n` is greater than `right`, `tleftZero` is less than half of `right`, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value and `trightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is less than half of `right` plus one and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right` minus one, and `right` is one more than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still greater than `right`, but `right` has increased by 1. The values of `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are still constrained by the original conditions, but now `right` is one more than its original value. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value and `trightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is less than half of `right` plus one and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right` minus one.
