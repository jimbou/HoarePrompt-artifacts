Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is less than n, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, rightZero is 2 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise rightZero is 1, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is 2 if the character at index i of string s is '1', otherwise rightOne is 1, tleftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s plus 1 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise tleftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, trightZero is 2 if the character at index i of string s is '0', otherwise trightZero is 1, tleftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, and trightOne is 2 if the character at index i of string s is '1', otherwise trightOne is 1.***
