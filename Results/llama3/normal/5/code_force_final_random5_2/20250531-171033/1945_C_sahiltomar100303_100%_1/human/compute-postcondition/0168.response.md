Output State: **n is greater than right, tleftZero is less than or equal to half of right, trightOne is less than half of n - right, tleftZero is one more than its original value, trightZero is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `right`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, making it one more than its original value. The value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1, making it one less than its original value. The relationship between `tleftZero` and `right` is updated to reflect that `tleftZero` is now less than or equal to half of `right`, as it was incremented by 1. The relationship between `trightOne` and `n - right` remains unchanged, as `trightOne` is not modified by the code.
