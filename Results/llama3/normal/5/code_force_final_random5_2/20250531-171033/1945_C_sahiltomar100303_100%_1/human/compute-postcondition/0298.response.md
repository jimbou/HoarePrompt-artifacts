Postcondition: **left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus the number of '0's in the second half of string s, rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus the number of '1's in the second half of string s. If right is not equal to n, the current value of right is printed. If right is equal to n, and rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of left which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is equal to n is printed.**
