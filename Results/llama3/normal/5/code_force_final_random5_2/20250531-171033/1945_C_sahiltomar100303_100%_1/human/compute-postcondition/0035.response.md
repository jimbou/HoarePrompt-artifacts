Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s has less than (mid + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of s has less than (n - mid + 1) // 2 '1's, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is equal to n, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, and trightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of s, left is equal to mid, leftMove is 0, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '0'.**
