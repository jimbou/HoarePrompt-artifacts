Postcondition: **The program prints the value of either `left` or `right` based on the conditions. If `left` is 0, the program prints the value of `right` if `right` is not equal to `n`, or prints the value of `left` if `right` is equal to `n` and `rightOne` is less than (n + 1) // 2, or prints the value of `right` if `right` is equal to `n` and `rightOne` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. If `left` is not 0, the program prints the value of `left` if `right` is equal to `n` and `leftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2, or prints the value of `right` if `right` is equal to `n` and `leftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, or prints the value that is closer to the middle index of string `s` if `right` is not equal to `n`.**
