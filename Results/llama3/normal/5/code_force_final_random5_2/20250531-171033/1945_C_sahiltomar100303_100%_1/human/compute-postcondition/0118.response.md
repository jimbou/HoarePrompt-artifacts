Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 1, mid is at least 2, s is a string, stdin contains no inputs, leftZero is 1, tleftZero is 1, leftOne is 2, tleftOne is 2**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was 1 and `tleftOne` was 1, they both become 2. No other variables are affected.
