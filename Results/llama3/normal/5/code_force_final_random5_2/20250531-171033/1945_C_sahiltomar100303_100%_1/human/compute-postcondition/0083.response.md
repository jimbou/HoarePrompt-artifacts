Postcondition: ***right is equal to n, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, the current value of s[left - 1] is '1', and left is equal to 0. If right is not equal to n, the value of right is being printed. If right is equal to n, then if rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, left is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right is being printed.***
