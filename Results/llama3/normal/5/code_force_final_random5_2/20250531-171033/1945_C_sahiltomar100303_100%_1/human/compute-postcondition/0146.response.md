Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n`. If the character at `left - 1` index in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
