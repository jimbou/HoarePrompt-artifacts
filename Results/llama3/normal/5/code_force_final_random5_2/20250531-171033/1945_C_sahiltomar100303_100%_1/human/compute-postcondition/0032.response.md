Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is equal to n, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, and trightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of s.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the variable `i` equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the second half of the string `s`. The variables `rightZero` and `rightOne` will hold the total count of '0's and '1's in the second half of `s`, respectively. The variables `trightZero` and `trightOne` will also hold the same counts as `rightZero` and `rightOne`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
