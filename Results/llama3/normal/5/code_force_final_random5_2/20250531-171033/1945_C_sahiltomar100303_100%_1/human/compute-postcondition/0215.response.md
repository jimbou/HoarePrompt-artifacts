The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is not specified, t is not specified. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1.
State: **right equals n, tleftZero equals n minus tleftOne, trightZero equals tleftZero, trightOne equals tleftOne, _ is increased by 1, t is not changed**
