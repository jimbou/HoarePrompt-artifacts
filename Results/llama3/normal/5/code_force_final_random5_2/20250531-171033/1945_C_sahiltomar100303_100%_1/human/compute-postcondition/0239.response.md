Output State: **n is an integer greater than n/2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s, rightZero is 2 if the character at index mid of string s is '0', otherwise it is 1, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is 1 if the character at index mid of string s is not '0', otherwise it is 0, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is n minus tleftOne minus 1 if the character at index mid of string s is '0', otherwise it is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne plus 1 if the character at index mid of string s is not '0', otherwise it is tleftOne, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid + 1**

The code increments the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` is initially 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, it becomes 2 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains 1. Similarly, `trightZero` is initially `n` minus `tleftOne` minus 1 if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it is `tleftZero`, so it becomes `n` minus `tleftOne` if the character at index `mid` of string `s` is '0', otherwise it remains `tleftZero`. No other variables are affected by the code.
