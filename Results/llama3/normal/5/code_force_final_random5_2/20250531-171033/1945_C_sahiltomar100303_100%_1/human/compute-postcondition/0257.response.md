Output State: **n is an integer greater than n/2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is less than half of mid - 1, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of string s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s minus two, rightOne is less than half of n - (mid - 2) + 2, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is n minus tleftOne minus the number of '0's in the second half of string s, trightOne is tleftOne plus the number of '1's in the second half of string s, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is n, left is mid - 2, leftMove is 0. If the character at index left - 1 of string s is '1', then the current value of the character at index left - 1 of string s is '1'. Otherwise, the character at index left - 1 of string s is not '0'.**
