Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of string s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of string s.**

The loop will continue to execute until the condition `left > 0` is no longer true, which means `left` will be 0. At this point, `leftZero` and `rightZero` will be the number of '0's in the first and second half of string `s`, respectively, and `leftOne` and `rightOne` will be the number of '1's in the first and second half of string `s`, respectively.
