State: **The program prints the value of either `left` or `right` based on the conditions. If `left` is equal to 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `left` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` is printed. If `left` is not equal to 0, then if `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `left` is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then if the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, the value of `left` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` is printed, t must be greater than 1**
