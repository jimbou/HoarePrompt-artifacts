Postcondition: ***right equals n, tleftZero equals n minus tleftOne, trightZero equals tleftZero, trightOne equals tleftOne, left equals 0, and the current value of right is equal to n. If the current value of tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of right which is n is being printed. Otherwise, the value of left which is 0 is being printed.***
