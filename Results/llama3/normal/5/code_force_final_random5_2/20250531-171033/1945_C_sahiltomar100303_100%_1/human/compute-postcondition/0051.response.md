Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s has less than (mid + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of s has less than (n - mid + 1) // 2 '1's, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is equal to n, left is greater than or equal to 0, leftMove is 0. If left is greater than 0, then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'. If left is 0, then leftZero is 0, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to execute until the condition `left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` is no longer true. This means that the loop will stop when `left` is 0 or when the number of '0's in the first half of `s` is greater than or equal to `(left + 1) // 2` and the number of '1's in the second half of `s` is greater than or equal to `(n - left + 1) // 2`.

In the final state, `left` will be greater than or equal to 0, and `leftMove` will still be 0. If `left` is greater than 0, then the number of '0's in the first half of `s` will be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, the number of '0's in the second half of `s` will be the same as before, the number of '1's in the first half of `s` will be the same as before, and the number of '1's in the second half of `s` will be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`. The character at index `left - 1` in string `s` will be '1'. If `left` is 0, then the number of '0's in the first half of `s` will be 0, the number of '0's in the second half of `s` will be the same as before, the number of '1's in the first half of `s` will be the same as before, and the number of '1's in the second half of `s` will be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`. The character at index `left - 1` in string `s` will be '1'.
