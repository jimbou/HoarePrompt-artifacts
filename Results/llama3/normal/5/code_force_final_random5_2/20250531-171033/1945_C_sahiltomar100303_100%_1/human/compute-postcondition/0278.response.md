Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is increased by 1, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus two if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus one if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', or it is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus one if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string s minus two if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it is the number of '0's in the second half of string s minus one if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', or it is the number of '0's in the second half of string s minus one if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus one if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it remains the same if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is '0', or it is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus two if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus one if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is '0', `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string s minus one if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it remains the same if s[right] is '0' and s[right+1] is '0', or it is the number of '1's in the second half of string s minus two if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is not '0', otherwise it is the number of '1's in the second half of string s minus one if s[right] is not '0' and s[right+1] is '0', and `right` is less than `n` and not equal to `n-1` and `s[right+1]` is '0', or `right` is not equal to 0 and `s[right+1]` is not '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` have been updated based on the new value of `right` and the characters at `s[right]` and `s[right+1]`. The value of `left` remains 0. The conditions on `right` and `s[right+1]` are also updated accordingly.
