Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and greater than 1, `left` is `mid - 2` and greater than -1, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`. If the character at `left - 1` index in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1 if the character at `mid - 1` index in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` remains the same and less than (`mid - 1 + 1`) // 2, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` and less than (`n - (`mid - 1`) + 1`) // 2, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at `mid - 1` index in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` remains the same, `leftOne` is one less than the original value, `rightOne` is one more than the original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the characters at the `left - 1` and `mid - 1` indices in string `s` are still valid, and the counts of '0' and '1' characters in the first and second halves of `s` are updated accordingly.
