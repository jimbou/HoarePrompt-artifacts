Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to mid + 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 1, trightZero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 1, stdin contains no inputs, i is mid + 1**

The code increments the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` and `trightOne` were previously 0, they both become 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
