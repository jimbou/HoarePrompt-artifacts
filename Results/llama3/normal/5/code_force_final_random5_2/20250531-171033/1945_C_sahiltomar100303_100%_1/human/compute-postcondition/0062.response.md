Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s has less than (mid + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of s has less than (n - mid + 1) // 2 '1's, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is equal to n, left is greater than 0 and left is less than right - 1 and left is less than or equal to right, leftMove is 0, right is equal to mid + 1, leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s minus 1 if s[right] is '0', otherwise rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s plus 1, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2 minus 1, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'.**

In this final state, the value of `leftOne` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `rightOne` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
