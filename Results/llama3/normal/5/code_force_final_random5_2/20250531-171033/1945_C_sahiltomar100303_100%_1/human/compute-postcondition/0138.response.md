Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than or equal to mid + 3, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 3 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 2 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 1, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is 3 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 2, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 2 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 1, stdin contains no inputs, i is mid + 2.**
