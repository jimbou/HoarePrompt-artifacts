Postcondition: ***right equals n, tleftZero equals n minus tleftOne, trightZero equals tleftZero, trightOne equals tleftOne. If left is 0, then if right is not equal to n, the value of right which is not equal to n is printed. If right equals n, and the current value of rightOne is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of left which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is n is being printed. If left is not equal to 0, then if right equals n, the values of right, tleftZero, trightZero, trightOne remain unchanged. If left is not equal to 0, the value of left is printed. If left equals 0, then if tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of right which is n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left which is 0 is printed. If right is not equal to n, the value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the range (n + 1) // 2.***
