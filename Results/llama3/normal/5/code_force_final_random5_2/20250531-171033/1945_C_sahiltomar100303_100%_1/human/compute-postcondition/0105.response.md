Postcondition: ***`right` is not equal to `n`, `leftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '1', and `left` is not equal to 0. If the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then the value of `left` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is not equal to `n` is printed.***
