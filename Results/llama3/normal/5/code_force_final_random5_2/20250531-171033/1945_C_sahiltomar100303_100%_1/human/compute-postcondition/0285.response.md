Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus the number of '0's in the second half of string s, rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus the number of '1's in the second half of string s, rightOne is 0, and right is n.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the left pointer remains at 0, the number of '0's in the first half of the string is increased by the number of '0's in the second half of the string, the number of '0's in the second half of the string becomes 0, the number of '1's in the first half of the string is increased by the number of '1's in the second half of the string, the number of '1's in the second half of the string becomes 0, and the right pointer reaches the end of the string (n).
