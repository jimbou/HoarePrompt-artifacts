Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `mid` is at least 1, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains no inputs. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.***
