Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `n/2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2. If the character at index `left - 2` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is less than half of `mid - 1` minus one, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s` plus one, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` minus one, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - (mid - 2) + 1`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid - 1`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` minus two, and `rightOne` is less than half of `n - (mid - 2) + 2`. In both cases, `tleftZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne`, `trightZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne` minus the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, `trightOne` is `tleftOne` plus the number of '1's in the second half of string `s`, `right` is `n`, `t` is not changed, `stdin` contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n`, `left` is `mid - 3`, and `leftMove` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `left` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `left` being `mid - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
