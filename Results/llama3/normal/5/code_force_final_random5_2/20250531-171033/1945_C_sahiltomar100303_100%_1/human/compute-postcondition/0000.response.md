Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that `t` has been assigned the value of an integer larger than 0, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.
