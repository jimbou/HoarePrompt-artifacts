Postcondition: ***right equals n, tleftZero equals n minus tleftOne, trightZero equals tleftZero, trightOne equals tleftOne, and the current value of left is 0. If right is not equal to n, the value of right which is not equal to n is being printed. If right equals n, and the current value of rightOne is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of left which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is n is being printed.***
