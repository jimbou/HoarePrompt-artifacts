Output State: **The loop executes until `left` is less than or equal to 0 or the conditions `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` are no longer true, `right` is assigned the value of `mid`.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been updated to `mid`, while the conditions for the loop to continue executing remain the same. The loop will continue to run as long as `left` is greater than 0 and the conditions `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` are still true.
