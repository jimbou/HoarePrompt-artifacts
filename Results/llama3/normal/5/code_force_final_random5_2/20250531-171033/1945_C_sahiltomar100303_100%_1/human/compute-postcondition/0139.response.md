Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, stdin contains no inputs, i is n.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables rightZero, rightOne, trightZero, and trightOne will have counted the number of '0' and '1' characters in the second half of the string s. The other variables remain unchanged.
