Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 8, `s` is a string, `mid` is at least 4, `left` is greater than 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value, `rightZero` is one more than its original value, and `rightOne` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value, and `leftZero` and `rightOne` must satisfy the loop condition.***
