Output State: **`n` is greater than `right`, `tleftZero` is less than half of `right + 1`, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right`, `right` is one more than its original value. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `trightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, which affects the conditions involving `right`. The other variables' values remain the same, but their relationships with `right` have changed due to the increment. The conditions involving `s[right]` are now applied to `s[right - 1]` because `right` has been incremented.
