Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is at least 2, i is 2, leftZero is incremented by 1, tleftZero is incremented by 1**

The code increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. The initial values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are not specified, so we can only conclude that they are incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
