Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 2, mid is at least 2, s is a string, leftOne is 2 if s[i] is '0' otherwise it is 4, tleftOne is 2 if s[i] is '0' otherwise it is 4, leftZero is 3 if s[i] is '0' otherwise it is 1, tleftZero is 3 if s[i] is '0' otherwise it is 1, stdin contains no inputs.**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftOne` and `tleftOne` were initially 1, so they become 2. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `leftOne` and `tleftOne` were initially 3, so they become 4. The values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The values of `n`, `i`, `mid`, and `s` also remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. Stdin remains empty as it was initially empty and no inputs were read.
