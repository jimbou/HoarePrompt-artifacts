Postcondition: ***n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 1. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 2, leftOne is 0, rightZero is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne plus 2, trightZero is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne. If the character at index i of string s is '1', then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 2, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus 2, trightZero is n minus 2, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 1.***
