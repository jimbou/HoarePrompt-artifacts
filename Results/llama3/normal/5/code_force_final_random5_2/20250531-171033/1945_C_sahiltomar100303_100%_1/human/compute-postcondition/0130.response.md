Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, stdin contains no inputs, i is mid.***
