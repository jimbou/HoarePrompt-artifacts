Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `right`, `tleftZero` is less than half of `right`, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value and `trightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is less than half of `right` plus one and `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right` minus one.***
