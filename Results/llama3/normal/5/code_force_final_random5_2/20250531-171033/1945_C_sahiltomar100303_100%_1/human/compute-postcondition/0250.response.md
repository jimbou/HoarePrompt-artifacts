Output State: **n is an integer greater than n/2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s and must be less than half of left, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of string s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of string s and must be less than half of n - left + 1, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is n minus tleftOne minus the number of '0's in the second half of string s, trightOne is tleftOne plus the number of '1's in the second half of string s, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is n, left is mid, leftMove is 0. The current value of the character at index left - 1 of string s is '1'.**

The code modifies the values of `leftZero` and `rightZero`. The first line decrements `leftZero` by 1, and the second line increments `rightZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` and must be less than half of `left`, and `rightZero` was the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, these changes update the counts of '0's in the two halves of the string. The character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is now '1' because `leftZero` was decremented, indicating that the character at that index was previously '0' but is now '1'. All other variables remain unchanged.
