Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than n/2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s and must be less than half of left, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of string s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of string s and must be less than half of n - left + 1, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is n minus tleftOne minus the number of '0's in the second half of string s, trightOne is tleftOne plus the number of '1's in the second half of string s, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is n, left is mid, leftMove is 0. If the character at index left - 1 of string s is '1', then the current value of the character at index left - 1 of string s is '1'. Otherwise, the character at index left - 1 of string s is not '0', leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s minus one, and rightOne is the number of '1's in the second half of string s plus one.***
