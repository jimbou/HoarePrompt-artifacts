Output State: **n is at least 8, s is a string, mid is at least 4, left is greater than 0, leftZero is one less than its original value, rightZero is one more than its original value, and rightOne remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `left` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1, and the value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The value of `rightOne` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
