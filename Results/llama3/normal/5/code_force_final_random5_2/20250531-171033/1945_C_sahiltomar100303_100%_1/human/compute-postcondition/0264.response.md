Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `s` is a string, `mid` is at least 4, `left` is greater than -1. If `s[left]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value, `rightZero` is one more than its original value, and `rightOne` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value, and `leftZero` and `rightOne` must satisfy the loop condition.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `s[left - 1]` are now related to `s[left]` because `left` has been decremented.
