Postcondition: ***right is not equal to n, leftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is 0, the current value of s[left - 1] is '1', and left is not equal to 0. The absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is larger than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right***
