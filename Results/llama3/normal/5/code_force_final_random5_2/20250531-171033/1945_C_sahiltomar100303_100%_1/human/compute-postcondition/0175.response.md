Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `right`, `tleftZero` is less than half of `right + 1`, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right + 1`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `trightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.***
