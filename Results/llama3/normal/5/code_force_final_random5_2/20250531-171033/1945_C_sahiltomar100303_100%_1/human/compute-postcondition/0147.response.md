Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 1 if the character at `mid - 1` index in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` remains the same, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at `mid - 1` index in `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` remains the same, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decreased by 1, and its new value is `mid - 1`. If the character at `mid - 1` index in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` has been decreased by 1 and `rightZero` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` has been decreased by 1 and `rightOne` has been increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
