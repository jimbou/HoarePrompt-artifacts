Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to mid + 3, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 2 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 2, trightZero is 2 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 2, i is mid + 2, stdin contains no inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1, resulting in `rightOne` being 2 and `trightOne` being 2.
