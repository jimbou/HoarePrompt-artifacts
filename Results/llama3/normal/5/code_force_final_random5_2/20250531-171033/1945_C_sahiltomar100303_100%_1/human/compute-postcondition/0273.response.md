Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right+1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right+1]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right+1]` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, and `right` is less than or equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, which means it has moved one step to the right. The values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are updated based on the new value of `right`. If `s[right+1]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `rightZero` are updated accordingly. If `s[right+1]` is not '0', then `leftOne` and `rightOne` are updated accordingly. The value of `left` remains the same, which is 0.
