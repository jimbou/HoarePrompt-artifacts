The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is less than `n` and `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', otherwise `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s` plus 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, and `trightOne` is 1 if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', otherwise `trightOne` is 0, and if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1.**
