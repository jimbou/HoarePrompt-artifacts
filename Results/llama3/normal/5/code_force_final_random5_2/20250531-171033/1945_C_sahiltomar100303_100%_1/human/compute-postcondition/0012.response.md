Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is at least 2, i is 1. If s[i] is '0', then leftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 2, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. Otherwise, if s[i] is '1', then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 2, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 0. If s[i] is '0' and the else part executes, then leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0. If s[i] is '1' and the else part executes, then leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0.**
