Output State: **`n` is greater than `mid`, `tleftZero` is less than half of `right`, `trightOne` is less than half of `n - right`. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right - 1]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1, and `right` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, but the conditions on `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are still valid with respect to the new value of `right`. The conditions on `n` and `mid` are also still valid. The conditions on `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are now with respect to the character at index `right - 1` in the string `s`.
