The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mid, and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `mid`, and `n`. If `mid` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `mid`, so for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. 

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 0**
