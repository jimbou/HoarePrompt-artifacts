Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` plus one if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` minus one if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise it remains the same, and `right` (which is `mid`) is less than `n`.**
