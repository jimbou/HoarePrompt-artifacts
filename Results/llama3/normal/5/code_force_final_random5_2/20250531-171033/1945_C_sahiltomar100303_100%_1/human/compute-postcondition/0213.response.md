Postcondition: ***right, tleftZero, trightZero, trightOne are integers, left is not equal to 0, and right is equal to n. If right is equal to n, the values of right, tleftZero, trightZero, trightOne remain unchanged. If left is not equal to 0, the value of left is printed. If left equals 0, then if tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, the value of right which is n is printed. Otherwise, the value of left which is 0 is printed. If right is not equal to n, the value of either left or right is printed, whichever is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the range (n + 1) // 2.***
