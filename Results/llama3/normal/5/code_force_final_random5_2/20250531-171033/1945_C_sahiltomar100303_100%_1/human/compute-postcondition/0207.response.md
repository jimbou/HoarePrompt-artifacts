The code prints the current value of `left`, which is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the range `(n + 1) // 2` as the current value of `right`. Since the exact value of `n` and the current values of `left` and `right` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `left`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current value of `left` that satisfies the given conditions.

Output: **the current value of left (which is closer to or at the same distance from the middle of the range (n + 1) // 2 as the current value of right)**
