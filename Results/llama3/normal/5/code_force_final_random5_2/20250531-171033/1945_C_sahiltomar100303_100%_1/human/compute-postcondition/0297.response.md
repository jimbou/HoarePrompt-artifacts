Postcondition: ***left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s plus the number of '0's in the second half of string s, rightZero is 0, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s plus the number of '1's in the second half of string s, and right is equal to n. If rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the value of left which is 0 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of right which is equal to n is being printed.***
