Output State: **n is greater than mid, tleftZero is less than half of right + 1, trightOne is less than half of n - right, and s[right] is not equal to '0', tleftOne is one more than its original value, trightOne is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `mid`, `tleftZero`, `right`, `trightOne`, and `s[right]` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are to `tleftOne` and `trightOne`, which are incremented and decremented by 1, respectively.
