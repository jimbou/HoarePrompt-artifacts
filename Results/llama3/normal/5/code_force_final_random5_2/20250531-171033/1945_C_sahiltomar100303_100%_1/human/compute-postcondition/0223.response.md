The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `mid` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `mid` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is greater than 1, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is 1. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne plus 1, trightZero is tleftZero, trightOne is tleftOne. Otherwise, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus 1, trightZero is n minus 1, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 1.**
