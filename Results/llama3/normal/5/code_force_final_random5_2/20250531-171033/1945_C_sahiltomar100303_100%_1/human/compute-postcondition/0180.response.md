Based on the precondition, we know that `right` is not equal to `n`. However, we don't have any explicit value for `right`. We also have information about other variables, but they are not relevant to the `print` statement.

Since we don't have an explicit value for `right`, we can't provide a numerical value. However, we can describe its value based on the given information.

Output: **the value of right (which is not equal to n)**
