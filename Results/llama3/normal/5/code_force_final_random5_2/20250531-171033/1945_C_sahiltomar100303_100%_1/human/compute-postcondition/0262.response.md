Output State: **n is at least 8, s is a string, mid is at least 4, leftZero and rightOne must satisfy the loop condition, left is greater than 0, leftOne is one less than its original value, and rightOne is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and `left` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only changes are in the values of `leftOne` and `rightOne`, which are decremented and incremented by 1, respectively.
