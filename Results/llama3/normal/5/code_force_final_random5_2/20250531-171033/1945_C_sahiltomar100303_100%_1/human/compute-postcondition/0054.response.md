Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 3 and 3*10^5 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s has less than (mid + 1) // 2 '0's and the second half of s has less than (n - mid + 1) // 2 '1's, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, i is equal to n, left is less than right - 1 and left is less than or equal to right, leftMove is 0, right is equal to mid. If left is greater than 0, then leftZero is less than (left + 1) // 2, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'. If left is 0, then leftZero is 0, rightZero is the number of '0's in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of s, rightOne is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the current value of s[left - 1] is '1'. The current value of s[right] is '0'.***
