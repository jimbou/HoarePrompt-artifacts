Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `n/2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` divided by 2, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of string `s` and must be less than half of `left`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` and must be less than half of `n - left + 1`, `tleftZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne`, `trightZero` is `n` minus `tleftOne` minus the number of '0's in the second half of string `s`, `trightOne` is `tleftOne` plus the number of '1's in the second half of string `s`, `right` is `n`, `t` is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, `i` is `n`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is '1', then the current value of the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is '1'. Otherwise, the character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is not '0', `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of string `s` minus one, and `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of string `s` plus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The character at index `left - 1` of string `s` is either '1' or not '0', and the counts of '1's and '0's in the first and second halves of string `s` are updated accordingly.
