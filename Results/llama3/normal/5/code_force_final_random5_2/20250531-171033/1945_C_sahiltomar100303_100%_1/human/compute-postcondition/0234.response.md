Output State: **n is an integer greater than n/2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n divided by 2, leftZero is the number of '0's in the first half of string s, rightZero is 1, leftOne is the number of '1's in the first half of string s, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is n minus tleftOne, trightZero is n minus tleftOne minus 1, trightOne is tleftOne, right is n, t is not changed, stdin contains 1 input: a string, i is mid.**

The code increments the value of `rightZero` by 1 and `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The value of `trightZero` was initially equal to `tleftZero`, which is `n` minus `tleftOne`. After incrementing `trightZero` by 1, it becomes `n` minus `tleftOne` minus 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
