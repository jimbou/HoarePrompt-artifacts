Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `_` is `t`, `value` is an integer greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, with `values` still being a list of sums of digits, `stdin` being empty, `i` being greater than or equal to `t` with at least one digit, `sum_value_digits` being the sum of all digits of `i`, and `x` being the last digit of `i`. The value of `values[value]` is being printed, where `value` is an integer greater than or equal to `t` with at least one digit.
