Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 3 and has at least 2 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the second digit of `i` plus the second digit of `i`, `x` is the second digit of `i`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sum_value_digits` is updated to be the sum of the second digit of `i` and the second digit of `i` again, which is essentially twice the second digit of `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
