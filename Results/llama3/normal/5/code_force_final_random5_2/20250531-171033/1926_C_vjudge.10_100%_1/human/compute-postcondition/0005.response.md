To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in str(i):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `x` and `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 1 digit. Since `x` is the first digit of `i`, we know that `x` is a single digit.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least one more digit. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to have at least two digits.

The state of `x` will be the next digit in the string representation of `i`. Since `x` is currently the first digit of `i`, the next digit will be the second digit of `i`.

The states of `t`, `values`, `stdin`, and `sum_value_digits` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, `stdin` contains a series of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5) equal in number to the original value of `t` minus 2, `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 2 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the first digit of `i`, `x` is the second digit of `i`**
