Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    value = int(input())
    print(values[value])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` contains one input: an integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `_` is 0, `value` is an integer, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `_` is 1, `value` is an integer greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` contains one input: an integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `_` is 2, `value` is an integer greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and `value` is assigned the value of the input integer, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
