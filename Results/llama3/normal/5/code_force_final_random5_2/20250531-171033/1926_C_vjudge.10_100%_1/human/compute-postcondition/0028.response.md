Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` has at least 3 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the third digit of `i` plus the third digit of `i` plus the third digit of `i`, `x` is the third digit of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated by adding the value of `x`, which is the third digit of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
