To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the digits of `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must have at least one digit. Since `i` is already greater than 2 and has at least 1 digit, we can conclude that `i` has at least 1 digit. Therefore, the state of `i` remains the same.

The state of `x` needs to be adjusted. Since `x` is the last digit of `i + 1`, we can conclude that `x` is a digit between 0 and 9.

The other variables `t`, `values`, `stdin`, and `sum_value_digits` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `x` is a digit between 0 and 9**
