To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for x in str(i):`, which means we are iterating over the digits of the integer `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is greater than 2 and has at least 1 digit.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `x`.

Since `i` has at least 1 digit, we can assume that `i` is a multi-digit number. Let's say `i` has `n` digits.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the last digit of `i`. To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next digit of `i`.

So, we can adjust the state as follows:

* `i` remains the same, but we need to consider the next digit of `i`.
* `x` is the next digit of `i`, which is the digit at index `n-2` (since we are 0-indexed).

The other variables `t`, `values`, `stdin`, and `sum_value_digits` are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` and its previous value, `x` is the next digit of `i`**
