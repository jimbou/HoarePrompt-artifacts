The code prints the value of `values[value]`, where `value` is an integer.

Since `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers, and `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, the value of `values[value]` is the sum of all digits of `value` plus the value of `values[value - 1]`.

However, the exact value of `value` is not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of `values[value]`. But based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **the sum of all digits of value plus the value of values[value - 1] (where value is an integer)**
