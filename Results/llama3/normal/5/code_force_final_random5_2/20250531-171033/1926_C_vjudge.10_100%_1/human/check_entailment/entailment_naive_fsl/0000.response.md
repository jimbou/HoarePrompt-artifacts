Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses dynamic programming to precalculate the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5, and then uses this precalculated array to answer each test case in constant time.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1 or 2 * 10^5. The program also handles the case where n is a large number, as the precalculation step allows it to answer each test case quickly, within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
