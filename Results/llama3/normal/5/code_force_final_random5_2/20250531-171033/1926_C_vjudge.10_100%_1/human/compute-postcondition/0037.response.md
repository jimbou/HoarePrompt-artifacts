Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `_` is 1, `value` is an integer greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `value` has been updated to be the input integer, which is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit. The stdin is now empty since the input has been read. The other variables remain unchanged.
