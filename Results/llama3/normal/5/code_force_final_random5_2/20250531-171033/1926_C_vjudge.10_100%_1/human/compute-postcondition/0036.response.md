The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` contains one input: an integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `_` is 1, `value` is an integer, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed**
