To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in str(i):`. This means that the loop iterates over the digits of the string representation of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 2 digits. This means that `str(i)` has at least 2 characters.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `x` and `i`.

Since `x` is the second digit of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to move to the next digit in the string representation of `i`. Therefore, `x` should be the third digit of `i` (if it exists).

Since `i` has at least 2 digits, we can increment it by 1, making it greater than 1 and having at least 2 digits.

The other variables (`t`, `values`, `stdin`, and `sum_value_digits`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, `stdin` contains a series of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5) equal in number to the original value of `t` minus 2, `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 2 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the first digit of `i` and the second digit of `i`, `x` is the third digit of `i`**
