Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` contains one input: an integer, `i` is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `_` is 2, `value` is an integer greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed, and `value` is assigned the value of the input integer, and the value of `values[value]` which is the sum of all digits of `value` plus `values[value - 1]` is being printed**
