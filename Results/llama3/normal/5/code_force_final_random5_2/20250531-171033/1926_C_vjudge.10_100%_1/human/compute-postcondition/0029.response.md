Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 3 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where each `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus the previous value in the list, `stdin` remains empty, `i` is greater than 3 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, and `x` is the last digit of `i`.
