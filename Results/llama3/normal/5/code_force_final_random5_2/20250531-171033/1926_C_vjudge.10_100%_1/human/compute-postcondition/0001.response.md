To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the constant `inf`. Since `inf` is not a variable that can be adjusted, we focus on `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to infinity. However, since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, we can adjust the state to reflect that `i` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, `stdin` contains a series of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5) equal in number to the original value of `t` minus 1, `i` is at least 1**
