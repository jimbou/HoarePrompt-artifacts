Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 3 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `values[i]` is updated to be the sum of all digits of `i` plus the previous value of `values[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `values` still contains 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers, and `t` is still an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. The standard input `stdin` is still empty. The variable `i` is still greater than 3 and has at least 1 digit, and `sum_value_digits` is still equal to the sum of all digits of `i`. The variable `x` is still the last digit of `i`.
