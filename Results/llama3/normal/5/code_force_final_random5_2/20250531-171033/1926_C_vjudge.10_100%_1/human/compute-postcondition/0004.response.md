Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, `stdin` contains a series of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5) equal in number to the original value of `t` minus 2, `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the first digit of `i`, `x` is the first digit of `i`**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated to be equal to the first digit of `i`, which is also the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of integers in `stdin` has decreased by 1, as one integer has been processed.
