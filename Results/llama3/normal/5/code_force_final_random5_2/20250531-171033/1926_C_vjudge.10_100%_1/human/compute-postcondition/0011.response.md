The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `inf`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 1 digit. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i + 1`, `x` is the last digit of `i + 1`**
