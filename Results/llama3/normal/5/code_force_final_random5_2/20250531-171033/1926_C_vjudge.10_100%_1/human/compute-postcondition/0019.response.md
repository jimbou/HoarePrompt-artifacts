Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t`, `values`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still greater than 2 and has at least 1 digit. The variable `sum_value_digits` now holds the sum of all digits of `i`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all digits of `i` and added them to `sum_value_digits`. The variable `x` now holds the last digit of `i`, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over all digits of `i`.
