Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, values is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, stdin contains a series of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5) equal in number to the original value of t minus 1.**

The first line assigns the value of 2 * 10^5 + 1 to inf. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to t. Since the input is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, t becomes an integer within this range. The third line creates a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros and assigns it to values. The stdin now contains a series of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5) equal in number to the original value of t minus 1, as one integer has been consumed by the input operation.
