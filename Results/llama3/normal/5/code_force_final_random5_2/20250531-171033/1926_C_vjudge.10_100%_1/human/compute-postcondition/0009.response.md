Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `t` remains within its initial range, the list `values` remains unchanged with all zeros, the input stream `stdin` is exhausted, the variable `i` has at least one digit and is greater than 1, the sum of the digits of `i` is stored in `sum_value_digits`, and `x` holds the last digit of `i`.
