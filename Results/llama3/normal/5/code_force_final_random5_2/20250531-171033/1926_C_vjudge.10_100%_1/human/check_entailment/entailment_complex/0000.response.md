Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the cumulative sum of digits for all integers from 1 to 2 * 10^5 and stores it in the `values` list. This is done using a simple loop that iterates over each integer, calculates the sum of its digits, and adds it to the cumulative sum.

2. Then, the program reads `t` integers from standard input and for each integer, it prints the cumulative sum of digits stored in the `values` list.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the input integer is 1, in which case the cumulative sum of digits is simply 1.

4. The program also correctly handles the case where the input integer is greater than 1, in which case the cumulative sum of digits is the sum of the digits of the integer plus the cumulative sum of digits of the previous integer.

5. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors.

6. The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the largest input integer, which is 2 * 10^5 in this case. This is because the program uses a simple loop to calculate the cumulative sum of digits for all integers from 1 to 2 * 10^5. This is within the allowed time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

7. The program's space complexity is O(n), where n is the largest input integer, which is 2 * 10^5 in this case. This is because the program uses a list of size 2 * 10^5 + 1 to store the cumulative sum of digits for all integers from 1 to 2 * 10^5. This is within the allowed memory limit.

Therefore, the program is correct and should pass all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
