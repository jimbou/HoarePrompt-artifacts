Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, `stdin` contains a series of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5) equal in number to the original value of `t` minus 1, `i` is at least 1, `sum_value_digits` is 0**

The code initializes a new variable `sum_value_digits` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `values`, `stdin`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
