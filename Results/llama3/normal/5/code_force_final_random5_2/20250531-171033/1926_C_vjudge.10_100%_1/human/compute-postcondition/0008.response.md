Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, `stdin` contains a series of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5) equal in number to the original value of `t` minus 2, `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 2 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the first digit of `i`, the second digit of `i`, and the third digit of `i`, `x` is the third digit of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated to include the third digit of `i`, which is stored in `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
