Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to `t` and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of all digits of `i`, `x` is the last digit of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now greater than or equal to the initial value of `t`. The list `values` has been updated to contain the sum of all digits of each index `i` plus the value at the previous index. The input from `stdin` has been fully processed and is now empty. The variables `sum_value_digits` and `x` still hold the sum of the digits of the last value of `i` and the last digit of `i`, respectively.
