Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 2 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the sum of the digit `x` and its previous value plus the next digit of `i` plus the next digit of `i`, `x` is the next digit of `i`**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated by adding the integer value of `x`, which is the next digit of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
