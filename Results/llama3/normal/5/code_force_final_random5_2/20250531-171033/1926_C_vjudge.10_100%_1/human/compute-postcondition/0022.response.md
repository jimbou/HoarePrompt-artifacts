Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 3 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to 0, `x` is the last digit of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum_value_digits` has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `values` still contains the sum of all digits of each index plus the previous value, and `i` still has at least one digit and is greater than 3. The last digit of `i` is still stored in `x`.
