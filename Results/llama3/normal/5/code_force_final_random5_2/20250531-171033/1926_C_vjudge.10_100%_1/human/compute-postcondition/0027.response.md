To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for x in str(i):`, which means the loop iterates over the characters (digits) of the string representation of `i`.

From the current state, we know that `i` is greater than 3 and has at least 2 digits.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what happens when we move to the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Since `x` is the second digit of `i`, we can infer that the first digit of `i` has already been processed in the previous iteration. Therefore, to execute the loop again, `i` must have at least one more digit.

Let's update the state accordingly:

* `t` remains an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 (no change)
* `values` remains a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]` (no change)
* `stdin` remains empty (no change)
* `i` must have at least one more digit (update)
* `sum_value_digits` is equal to the second digit of `i` plus the second digit of `i` (no change, but note that the second digit of `i` will be different in the next iteration)
* `x` is the second digit of `i` (update: `x` will be the next digit in the string representation of `i`)

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` has at least 3 digits, `sum_value_digits` is equal to the third digit of `i` plus the third digit of `i`, `x` is the third digit of `i`**
