The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` has at least 1 digit the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 3 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to 0, `x` is the last digit of `i`. So for the loop to be executed  the `i` must have at least 1 digit and the `x` is the first digit of `i`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of all digits of `i` plus `values[i - 1]`, `values[i]` is updated to be equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than 3 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is equal to 0, `x` is the first digit of `i`**
