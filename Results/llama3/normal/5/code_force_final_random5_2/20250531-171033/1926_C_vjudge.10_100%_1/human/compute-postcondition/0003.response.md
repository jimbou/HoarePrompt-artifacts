According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1 and has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is at least 1, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute because `i` could be 1, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 1 digit and `x` is the first digit of `i`. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `values` is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, `stdin` contains a series of integers (each greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5) equal in number to the original value of `t` minus 1, `i` is greater than 1 and has at least 1 digit, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `x` is the first digit of `i`**
