Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is `0`, and `mini` is `11111111`. The current value of `start` is less than `len(lst) - 1`***
