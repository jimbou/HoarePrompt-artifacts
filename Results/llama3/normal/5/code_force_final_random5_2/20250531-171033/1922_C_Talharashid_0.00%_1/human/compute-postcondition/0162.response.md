Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` if the previous value of `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s+1`, `d2` is a dictionary with 2 key-value pairs where the key is `start` and the value is `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` if the previous value of `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s+1`, and the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is 0 or 1 or more, `inc` is -1, `start` is equal to `start+inc` and `start+inc` must be less than `end`, `mini` is 11111111.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111, while all other variables retain their previous values and properties.
