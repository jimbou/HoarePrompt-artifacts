Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111, d1 is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the first key is the previous value of start and the value is the value of s plus 1 if the previous mini equals the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise the value is the value of s, the second key is the new value of start and the value is the value of s, and the third key is the new value of start and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has at least one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the value of start plus 1 and start must be less than end - 1 if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise start remains unchanged, s is increased by 1 if mini equals the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] if mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise s remains unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers. If start - 1 is greater than -1, the above conditions are met. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc` (which is 1) and updates the dictionary `d1` with a new key-value pair where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is the current value of `s`. The value of `s` is increased by 1 if `mini` equals the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise it is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The other variables remain unchanged.
