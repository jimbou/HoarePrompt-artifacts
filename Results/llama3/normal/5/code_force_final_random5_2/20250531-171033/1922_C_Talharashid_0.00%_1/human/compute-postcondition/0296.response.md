Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of distinct non-decreasing integers, another integer, and a list of pairs of distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list in both forward and backward directions, and then prints the minimum of these sums for each pair of indices in the list.**
