According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end. If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is either greater than 0 or 0, and end is the last index of lst. For the loop to be executed one more time, start must be less than end.

State: **t is an integer greater than m+2, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is start+1 and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, start is either greater than 0 or 0 and start must be less than end, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first and last elements of lst if the list has more than one element, otherwise mini is 11111111, s is either 1 or the absolute difference between the first and second elements of lst if the list has more than one element, otherwise s is 0.**
