The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `m` must be  greater than 2, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `start` is the value of start from stdin minus 1, `end` is the value of end from stdin minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at end and the value of d2 at start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at start and the value of d1 at end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed**
