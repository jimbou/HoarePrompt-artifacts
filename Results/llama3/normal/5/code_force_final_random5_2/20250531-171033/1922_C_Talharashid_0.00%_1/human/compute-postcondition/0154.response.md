Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with `1` key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is `0` or `1` or more, `inc` is `-1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 3` or less. If `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, then `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`, and `s` is `1` if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2])`, otherwise `s` is `abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2])`. Otherwise, `s` is `0`.***
