Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of `lst` and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of `lst` and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is the first index of `lst`, `inc` is `-1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is greater than `end`, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` plus 1 if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s`, and `mini` is 11111111.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the variable `mini` has been assigned the value 11111111. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
