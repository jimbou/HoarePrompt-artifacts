Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `s` is the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `s` is 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is either greater than -1 or -1, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first and last elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `mini` is 11111111. The stdin contains no input. The absolute difference between the first and last elements of `lst` is not equal to `mini`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise it remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
