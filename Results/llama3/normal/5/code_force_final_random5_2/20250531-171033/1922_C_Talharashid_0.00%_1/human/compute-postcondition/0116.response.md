Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `start` is `start+inc` and `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, and `mini` is 11111111, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `inc`, `start`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is reset to 11111111. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs.
