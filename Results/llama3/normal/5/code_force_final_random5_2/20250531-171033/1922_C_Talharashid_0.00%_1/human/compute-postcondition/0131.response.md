Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s+1` or `s+2`, and the key is `start+2*inc` and the value is `s+1`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than `start+2*inc`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `start+2*inc` and `start` must be less than `end`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is either 3 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 2. Otherwise, `s` is either 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is either 3 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 2. Otherwise, `s` is either 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables are still valid, but the value of `s` is now either 2 or 3, or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 2, depending on the values of `mini` and the absolute differences between elements of `lst`.
