Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1. If `start` is greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the `start`th and `(start-1)`th elements of `lst`. If the absolute difference between the `start`th and `(start+inc)`th elements of `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between the `start`th and `(start+inc)`th elements of `lst` and the previous value of `s`.***
