Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `start` is `start+inc` and `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` if `start - 1` is greater than -1. Otherwise, `mini` remains the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111.***
