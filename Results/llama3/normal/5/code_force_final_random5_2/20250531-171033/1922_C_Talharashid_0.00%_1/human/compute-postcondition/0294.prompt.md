Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of `lst` and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of `lst` and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is the first index of `lst`, `inc` is -1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is equal to `end`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111 if `start - 1` is less than the length of `lst`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than m+2, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, end is the first index of lst, inc is -1, m is an integer greater than 0, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111 if start - 1 is less than the length of lst. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If start - 1 is greater than -1, then mini is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. If the current value of start is less than the current value of end, then s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end]. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between d2[end] and d2[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d1[start] and d1[end], and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than m+2, i is 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, end is the first index of lst, inc is -1, m is an integer greater than 1, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111 if start - 1 is less than the length of lst. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If start - 1 is greater than -1, then mini is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. If the current value of start is less than the current value of end, then s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end]. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between d2[end] and d2[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d1[start] and d1[end], and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than m+2, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, end is the first index of lst, inc is -1, m is an integer greater than 2, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111 if start - 1 is less than the length of lst. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If start - 1 is greater than -1, then mini is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. If the current value of start is less than the current value of end, then s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end]. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between d2[end] and d2[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d1[start] and d1[end], and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
