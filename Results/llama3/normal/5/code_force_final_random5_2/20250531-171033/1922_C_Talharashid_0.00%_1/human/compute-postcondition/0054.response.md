Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mini` is 11111111, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of lst minus 1, `inc` is -1. If the length of lst is more than 1, start is either 0 and mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, or start is greater than 0. Otherwise, start is the length of lst minus 1. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s. start must be less than the length of lst minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
