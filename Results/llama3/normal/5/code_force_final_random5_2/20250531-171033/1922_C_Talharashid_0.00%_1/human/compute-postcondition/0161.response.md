The variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is equal to start+inc and end is 0 or 1 or more. For the loop to be executed one more time, start must be less than end if inc is -1. So start must be less than end and start+inc must be less than end.
State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start+inc and the value is s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] if mini is not equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), otherwise s+1, d2 is a dictionary with 2 key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] if mini is not equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), otherwise s+1, and the key is start+inc and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is 0 or 1 or more, inc is -1, start is equal to start+inc and start+inc must be less than end, mini is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it retains its previous value.**
