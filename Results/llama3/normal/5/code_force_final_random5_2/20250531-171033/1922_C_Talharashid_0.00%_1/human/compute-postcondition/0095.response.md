Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 2, m is greater than 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is the value of start from stdin minus 1, end is the value of end from stdin minus 1, inc is -1, s is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end.**
