Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, and `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` if `lst` has at least two elements, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111. The current value of `start` is greater than 0.***
