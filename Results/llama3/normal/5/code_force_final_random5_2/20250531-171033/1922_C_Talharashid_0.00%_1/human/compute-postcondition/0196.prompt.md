Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is 0, inc is -1, start is 0, s is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst if mini is not equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), otherwise s is the number of times mini is equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), and m is an integer read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-1, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-1, inc is -1, s is 0, and m is an integer greater than 0. If start is less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. If start is not less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is 1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-2, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-2, inc is -1, s is 0, m is an integer greater than 1. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end. The minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-3, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-3, inc is -1, s is 0, m is an integer greater than 2. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the decremented end and start indices, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the decremented start and end indices. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the decremented end and start indices, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the decremented start and end indices. , and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
