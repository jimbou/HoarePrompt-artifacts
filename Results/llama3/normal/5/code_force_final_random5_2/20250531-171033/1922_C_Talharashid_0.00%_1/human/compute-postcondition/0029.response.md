Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, `d1` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the first key is the previous value of `start` and the value is the value of `s` plus 1 if the previous `mini` equals the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise the value is the value of `s`, and the second key is the new value of `start` and the value is the value of `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `start` is the value of `start` plus 1 and `start` must be less than `end - 1`, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the current element and the next element in the list `lst`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
