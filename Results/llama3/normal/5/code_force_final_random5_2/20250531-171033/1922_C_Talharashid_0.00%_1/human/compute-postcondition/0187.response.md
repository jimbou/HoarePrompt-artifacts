The code prints the minimum of the absolute differences between the values of dictionaries `d1` and `d2` at indices `start` and `end`. The specific values of `start` and `end` are not provided, but they are integers between 0 and `len(lst)-2`, where `lst` is a list with more than one element. The values of `d1` and `d2` are also not provided, but they are dictionaries with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs.

Output: **the minimum of the absolute differences between the values of dictionaries d1 and d2 at indices start and end**
