Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` if the previous value of `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s+1`, `d2` is a dictionary with 2 key-value pairs where the key is `start` and the value is `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` if the previous value of `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s+1`, and the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is 0 or 1 or more, `inc` is -1, `start` is equal to `start+inc` and `start+inc` must be less than `end`. If `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**

The code updates the value of `mini` by taking the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. Since `inc` is -1, `start` is equal to `start+inc`, and `start+inc` must be less than `end`, we know that `start` is less than `end`. Also, since `lst` has more than one element, we know that `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`. Therefore, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`.
