Output: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-3, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-3, inc is -1, s is 0, m is an integer greater than 2. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the decremented end and start indices, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the decremented start and end indices. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the decremented end and start indices, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the decremented start and end indices. , and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed**
