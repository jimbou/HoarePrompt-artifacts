Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the first key is `start+1` and the value is either `s+2` if the previous value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`, or `s + 1 + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` otherwise, the second key is `start+1+inc` and the value is `s+1`, and the third key is `start+2` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is less than `end` and is equal to `start+1`, `s` is either 2 or the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `s` is 1, plus the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst` if the previous value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`. If `start` is greater than 0, the previous value of `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start-1` in `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, the previous value of `mini` remains unchanged. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+1` in `lst` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then the previous conditions hold. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged. If `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`, then `d1` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the first key is `start+1` and the value is either `s+1` if the previous value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`, or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` otherwise, the second key is `start+1+inc` and the value is `s`, and the third key is `start+2` and the value is `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains an integer greater than `m+2`. The value of `i` remains `m+1`. The dictionary `d1` now has three key-value pairs: the first key is `start+1` with a value that depends on the previous value of `mini` and the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`, the second key is `start+1+inc` with a value of `s+1`, and the third key is `start+2` with a value of `s`. The dictionary `d2` remains empty. The value of `n` remains an integer. The list `lst` remains a non-empty list of integers. The value of `end` remains the last index of `lst`. The value of `inc` remains 1. The value of `m` remains an integer greater than or equal to 0. The value of `start` is now `start+1` and is less than `end`. The value of `s` is either 2 or the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `s` is 1, plus the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst` if the previous value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`. The previous value of `mini` and the conditions for `mini` remain unchanged.
