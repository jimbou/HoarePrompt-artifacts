The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, start is the second last index of lst and end is the first index of lst, So for the loop to  executed the first time lst needed to have been a list with at least 2 elements and start currently must not be equal to end.
State: **t is an integer greater than m+2, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, start is the second last index of lst, end is the first index of lst, inc is -1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s is 0**
