Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s+abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or `s+1+abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, and the key is `start+2*inc` and the value is `s+abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than `start+2*inc`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `start+2*inc` and `start` must be less than `end`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is either 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is either 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

The code increments the value of `s` by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `s` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
