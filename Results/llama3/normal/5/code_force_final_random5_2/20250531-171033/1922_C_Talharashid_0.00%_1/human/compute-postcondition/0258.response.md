Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+2, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, end is the first index of lst, inc is -1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, start is not equal to end and is now equal to start - 1, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc`, which is `-1`, effectively decrementing `start` by 1. Then, it assigns the current value of `s` to `d2[start]`. The value of `s` is updated based on the comparison between `mini` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If they are equal, `s` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains the same. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
