Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is an empty dictionary, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is 0, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, s is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 1 input.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is greater than 0, inc is 1, start is start+inc, s is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], and mini is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst if lst has more than one element, and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start is greater than -1, otherwise mini remains 11111111, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is start+inc and the value is s or s+1, and the key is start+2*inc and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is greater than 0, inc is 1, start is start+2*inc and start must be less than end. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is either 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] plus 1. Otherwise, s is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. If start + 1 is less than the length of lst, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start - 1 is greater than -1. Otherwise, mini remains the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is either `s+1` or `s+2` or `s+abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or `s+1+abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, the key is `start+2*inc` and the value is either `s+1` or `s+abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, and the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than `start+2*inc`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `start+inc` and `start` must be less than `end`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is either 2 or 3 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1 or 2. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is either 2 or 3 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1 or 2. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
