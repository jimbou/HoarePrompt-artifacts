Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least one element, `start` is 0, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is 11111111**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `mini` which is assigned the value 11111111. All other variables remain unchanged.
