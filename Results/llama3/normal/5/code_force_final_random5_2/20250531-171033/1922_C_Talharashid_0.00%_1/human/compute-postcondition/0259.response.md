The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is not equal to end and is now equal to start - 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time start must not be equal to end and start must be greater than end.
State: **t is an integer greater than m+2, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, end is the first index of lst, inc is -1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, start is greater than end, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus 1 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s.**
