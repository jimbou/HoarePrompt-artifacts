The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is start+2*inc and start must be less than end. For the loop to be executed one more time start must be less than end, so end must be greater than start+2*inc.
State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is start+inc and the value is s or s+1, and the key is start+2*inc and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is greater than start+2*inc, inc is 1, start is start+2*inc and start must be less than end. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is either 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] plus 1. Otherwise, s is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. If start + 1 is less than the length of lst, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start - 1 is greater than -1. Otherwise, mini remains the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111.**
