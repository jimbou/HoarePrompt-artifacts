Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and the previous value of `mini`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of `start` and the values are the values of `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of `start` and the values are the values of `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1. If the length of `lst` is more than 1, `start` is either 0 and `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`, or `start` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `start` is the length of `lst` minus 1. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s`. `start` must be less than the length of `lst` minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `start`, `mini`, `s`, and `lst` are still valid. The input in stdin is still available.
