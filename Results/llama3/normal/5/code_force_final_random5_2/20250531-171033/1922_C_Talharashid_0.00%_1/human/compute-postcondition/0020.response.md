Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the value of `start` and the value is the value of `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `start` is the value of `start` plus 1 and `start` must be less than `end`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.***
