Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least two elements, `start` is 0, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`, and the current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its current value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `start` is still less than the length of `lst` minus 1, indicating that there are still elements in `lst` to be processed.
