Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has at least one element, start is 0, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, s is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1. If the length of lst is more than 1, start is either 0 and mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, or start is greater than 0. Otherwise, start is the length of lst minus 1. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is either 0 or greater than 0, s is 2 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is 1 plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, mini is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise mini remains 11111111, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is either 0 or greater than 0 and start must be less than end, if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is 1 plus the value of s which is 2, otherwise s is 1 plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, start is now start - 1, and d2 now has an additional key-value pair where the key is the new value of start and the value is s.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
