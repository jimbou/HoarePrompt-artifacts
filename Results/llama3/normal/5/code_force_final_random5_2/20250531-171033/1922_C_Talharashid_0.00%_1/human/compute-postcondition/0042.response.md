Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of `start` and the values are the values of `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `start` is 0, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. The current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the current element and the next element in the list `lst` and its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
