Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-1, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-1, inc is -1, s is 0, m is an integer greater than 0, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end.**

The code snippet assigns the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at `end` and `start` to `s1`, and the absolute difference between the values of `d2` at `start` and `end` to `s2`. No other variables are affected. The values of `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the current values of `d1`, `d2`, `start`, and `end`.
