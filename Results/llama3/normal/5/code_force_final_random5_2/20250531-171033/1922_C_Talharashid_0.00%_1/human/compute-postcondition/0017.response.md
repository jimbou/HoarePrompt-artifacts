The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is the value of start plus 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time the value of start must be less than the value of end.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, d1 is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the value of start and the value is the value of s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has at least one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the value of start plus 1 and start must be less than end**
