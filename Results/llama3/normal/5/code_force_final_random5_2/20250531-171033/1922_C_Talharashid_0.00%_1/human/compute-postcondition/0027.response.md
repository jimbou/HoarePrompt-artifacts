According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end. If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is the value of start plus 1 and start must be less than end. For the loop to be executed one more time, start must be less than end. So start must be less than end - 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, d1 is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the first key is the previous value of start and the value is the value of s plus 1 if mini equals the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise the value is the value of s, and the second key is the new value of start and the value is the value of s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has at least one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the value of start plus 1 and start must be less than end - 1. If start is greater than 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini. If start + 1 is less than the length of lst, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. Additionally, if mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1]**
