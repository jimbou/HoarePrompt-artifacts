Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than m+2, i is m+1, d1 is an empty dictionary, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers, start is 0, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, s is 0, and m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than m+2, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is start+1 and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, start is either greater than 0 or 0, mini is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first and last elements of lst if the list has more than one element, otherwise mini is 11111111, s is either 1 or the absolute difference between the first and second elements of lst if the list has more than one element, otherwise s is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the first key is `start+1` and the value is either `s+1` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`, or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` otherwise, and the second key is `start+1+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is either greater than 0 or 0 and `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `s` is 0, plus the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`. If `start` is greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start-1` in `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the first key is `start+1` and the value is either `s+2` if the previous value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`, or `s + 1 + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` otherwise, the second key is `start+1+inc` and the value is `s+1`, and the third key is `start+2` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is less than `end` and is equal to `start+1`, `s` is either 2 or the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `s` is 1, plus the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst` if the previous value of `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`. If `start` is greater than 0, the previous value of `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start-1` in `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, the previous value of `mini` remains unchanged. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+1` in `lst` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then the previous conditions hold. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged. If `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`, then `d1` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the first key is `start+1` and the value is either `s+1` if the previous value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`, or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` otherwise, the second key is `start+1+inc` and the value is `s`, and the third key is `start+2` and the value is `s`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
