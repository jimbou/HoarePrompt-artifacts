Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-3, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-3, inc is -1, s is 0, m is an integer greater than 2, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the decremented end and start indices, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the decremented start and end indices.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the values of `d2` and `d1` at the decremented `start` and `end` indices, and assigns these differences to `s1` and `s2`, respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged. The values of `start` and `end` are decremented by 1, but their ranges are updated accordingly.
