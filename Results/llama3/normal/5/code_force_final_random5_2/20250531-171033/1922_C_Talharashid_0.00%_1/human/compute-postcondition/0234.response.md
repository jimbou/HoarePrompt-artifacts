Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+2, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers, start is the second last index of lst, end is the first index of lst, inc is -1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `start` and `end` have been swapped, with `start` now being the second last index of `lst` and `end` being the first index of `lst`. The value of `inc` has been changed to -1, and the value of `s` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
