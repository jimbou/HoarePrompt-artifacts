Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another city. 

The program first calculates the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list in both forward and backward directions. This is done to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another city.

Then, for each query, it calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the start city to the end city by taking the minimum of the cumulative sums in both forward and backward directions.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the start city is less than the end city and when the start city is greater than the end city.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is True.

Correctness: **True**
