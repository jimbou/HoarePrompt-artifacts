According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end. If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is either 0 and mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, or start is greater than 0. Otherwise, start is the length of lst minus 1. end is the length of lst minus 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, start must not be equal to end, which means start must be less than the length of lst minus 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1. If the length of lst is more than 1, start is either 0 and mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, or start is greater than 0. Otherwise, start is the length of lst minus 1. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s. start must be less than the length of lst minus 1.**
