Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than m+1, i is 1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-2, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-2, inc is -1, s is 0, m is an integer greater than 1. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end.***
