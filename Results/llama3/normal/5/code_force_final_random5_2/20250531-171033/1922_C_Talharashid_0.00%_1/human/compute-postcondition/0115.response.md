The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is start+inc, end is greater than 0, and inc is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time start must be less than end.
State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is greater than 0, inc is 1, start is start+inc and start must be less than end, s is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], and mini is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst if lst has more than one element, and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start is greater than -1, otherwise mini remains 11111111, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs.**
