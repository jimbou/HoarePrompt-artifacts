Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, mini is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise mini remains 11111111, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is either 0 or greater than 0 and start must be less than end, if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is 1 plus the value of s which is 2, otherwise s is 1 plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, start is now start - 1, and d2 now has an additional key-value pair where the key is the new value of start and the value is s.**
