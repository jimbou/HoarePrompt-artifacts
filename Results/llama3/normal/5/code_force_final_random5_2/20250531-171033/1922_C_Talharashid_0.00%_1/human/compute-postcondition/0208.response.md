Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The value of `start` is either greater than -1 or -1. The stdin contains no input. The current value of `mini` is either 11111111 or the absolute difference between the first and last elements of `lst` if the list `lst` has more than one element. The current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in the list `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
