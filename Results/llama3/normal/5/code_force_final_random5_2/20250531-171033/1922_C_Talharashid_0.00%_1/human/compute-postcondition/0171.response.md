Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is 0, inc is -1, start is 0, and s is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst if mini is not equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), otherwise s is the number of times mini is equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished iterating over the list `lst` from the end to the beginning. The variable `start` has reached the value of `end`, which is 0. The dictionary `d2` now has `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs, where each key is an index in `lst` and the value is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst` if `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise it is the number of times `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
