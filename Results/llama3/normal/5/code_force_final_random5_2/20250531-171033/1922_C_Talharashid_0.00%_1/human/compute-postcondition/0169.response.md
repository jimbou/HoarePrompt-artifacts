Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` if the previous value of `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s+1` if `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s+2`, `d2` is a dictionary with 2 key-value pairs where the key is `start` and the value is `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` if the previous value of `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s+1` if `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s+2`, and the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s` if `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s+1`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is 0 or 1 or more, `inc` is -1, `start` is equal to `start+inc` and `start+inc` must be less than `end`. If `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then the program executes as described above. Otherwise, no changes are made. `s` is increased by 1 if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.***
