Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `start` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` has key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s for all values of start from 0 to the length of `lst` minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with 1 input: a list of pairs of distinct integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, m is greater than 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is the length of lst minus 1 minus 1, s is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, m is greater than 1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is the value of start from stdin minus 1, end is the value of end from stdin minus 1, inc is -1, s is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between the value of d2 at end and the value of d2 at start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the value of d1 at start and the value of d1 at end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 2, m is greater than 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is the value of start from stdin minus 1, end is the value of end from stdin minus 1, inc is -1, s is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs. If start is less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end. If start is not less than end, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
