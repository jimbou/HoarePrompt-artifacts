Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is len(lst) - 1, end is 0, inc is -1, and s is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is a dictionary with 1 key-value pair where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is 0, inc is -1, start is len(lst) - 2, mini is the minimum of abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2]) and 11111111, s is 1 if mini is equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), otherwise s is abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2]) if start + 1 is less than len(lst), otherwise s is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start+inc and the value is s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] if mini is not equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), otherwise s+1, d2 is a dictionary with 2 key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] if mini is not equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), otherwise s+1, and the key is start+inc and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is 0 or 1 or more, inc is -1, start is len(lst) - 3 or less and is now equal to start+inc, mini is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and the previous value of mini if start - 1 is greater than -1, otherwise it retains its previous value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs, `d2` is a dictionary with 3 key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is 0 or 1 or more, `inc` is -1, `start` is equal to `start+inc-1` and `start+inc-1` must be less than `end`, `s` is increased by 1 if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
