Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of distinct non-decreasing integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of distinct integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that was read from the input, and the remaining test cases in the stdin contain three inputs each: a list of distinct non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of distinct integers.
