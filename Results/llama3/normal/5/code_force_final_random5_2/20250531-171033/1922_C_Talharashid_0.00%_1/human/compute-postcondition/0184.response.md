Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is 1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-2, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-2, inc is -1, s is 0, m is an integer greater than 1, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end.**

In this output state, the values of `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the absolute differences between the values of `d1` and `d2` at the indices `start` and `end`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
