Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs, `d2` is a dictionary with 3 key-value pairs, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is 0 or 1 or more, `inc` is -1, `start` is equal to `start+inc-1` and `start+inc-1` must be less than `end`, `s` is increased by 1 if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been decremented by 1 due to the line `start += inc`, where `inc` is -1. The dictionary `d2` now has an additional key-value pair with the key being the new value of `start` and the value being the current value of `s`. The value of `s` has been updated based on the comparison between `mini` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
