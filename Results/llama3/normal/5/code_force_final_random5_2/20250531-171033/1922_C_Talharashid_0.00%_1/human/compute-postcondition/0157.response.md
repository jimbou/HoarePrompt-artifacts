Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s+1`, `d2` is a dictionary with `1` key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s+1`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is `0` or `1` or more, `inc` is `-1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 3` or less. If `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, then `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` retains its previous value, `s` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, and this new value is reflected in the dictionaries `d1` and `d2`. The other variables retain their previous values and properties.
