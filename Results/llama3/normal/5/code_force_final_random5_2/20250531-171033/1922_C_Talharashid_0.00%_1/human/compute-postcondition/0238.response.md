Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of `lst` and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `start` is the second last index of `lst`, `end` is the first index of `lst`, `inc` is `-1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to `0`, `s` is `0`, and `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the last two elements of `lst` and `11111111`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the last two elements of `lst` and `11111111`. All other variables remain unchanged.
