To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and `i` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of distinct non-decreasing integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of distinct integers.**
