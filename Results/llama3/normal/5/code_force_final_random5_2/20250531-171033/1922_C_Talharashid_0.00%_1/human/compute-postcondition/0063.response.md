The only variable in the loop head is variable start and end, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable start and end.  If start is not equal to end, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, start is either 0 or greater than 0, end is the length of lst minus 1, and lst has more than one element. For the loop to be executed one more time start must be less than end.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is either 0 or greater than 0 and start must be less than end, s is 2 if mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is 1 plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers.**
