Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` if `lst` has more than one element, and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` if `start` is greater than -1, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111. The current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.***
