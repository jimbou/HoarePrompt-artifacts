Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, d1 is an empty dictionary, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a list of distinct non-decreasing integers, start is 0, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, s is 0
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, d1 is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the value of start and the value is the value of s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has at least one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the value of start plus 1. If start is greater than 0, mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between the startth and (start-1)th elements of lst. If the absolute difference between the startth and (start+inc)th elements of lst is equal to mini, then s is 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute difference between the startth and (start+inc)th elements of lst and the previous value of s.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, d1 is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the first key is the previous value of start and the value is the value of s plus 1 if mini equals the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise the value is the value of s, and the second key is the new value of start and the value is the value of s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has at least one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the value of start plus 1 and start must be less than end. If start is greater than 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini. If start + 1 is less than the length of lst, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. Additionally, if mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1].
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111, d1 is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the first key is the previous value of start and the value is the value of s plus 1 if the previous mini equals the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise the value is the value of s, the second key is the new value of start and the value is the value of s, and the third key is the new value of start and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has at least one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the value of start plus 1 and start must be less than end - 1 if start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise start remains unchanged, s is increased by 1 if mini equals the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] if mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and start + 1 is less than the length of lst, otherwise s remains unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers. If start - 1 is greater than -1, the above conditions are met. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
