Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `s` is 1, `mini` is the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

The code increments the value of `s` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now 1. The rest of the variables retain their initial values and properties.
