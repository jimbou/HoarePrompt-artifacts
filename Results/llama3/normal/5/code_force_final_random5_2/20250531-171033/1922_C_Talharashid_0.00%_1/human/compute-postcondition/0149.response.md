Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with `len(lst)-1` key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`. If `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, then `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2])` and `11111111`. Otherwise, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `mini` is `11111111`. Additionally, if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is `1`. Otherwise, `s` is `abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2])` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, otherwise `s` is `0`.***
