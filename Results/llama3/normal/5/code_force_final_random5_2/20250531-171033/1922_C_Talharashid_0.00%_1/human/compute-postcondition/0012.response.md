Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `s` is 1. If `start` is greater than 0, the current value of `mini` is the minimum of the previous `mini` and the absolute difference between the `start`th and `(start-1)`th elements of `lst`. The current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the `start`th and `(start + inc)`th elements of `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
