The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than m+2, i is 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, end is the first index of lst, inc is -1, m is an integer greater than 2, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111 if start - 1 is less than the length of lst. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If start - 1 is greater than -1, then mini is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc]. If the current value of start is less than the current value of end, then s1 is the absolute difference between d1[end] and d1[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d2[start] and d2[end]. Otherwise, s1 is the absolute difference between d2[end] and d2[start], and s2 is the absolute difference between d1[start] and d1[end], and the minimum of s1 and s2 is printed.**
