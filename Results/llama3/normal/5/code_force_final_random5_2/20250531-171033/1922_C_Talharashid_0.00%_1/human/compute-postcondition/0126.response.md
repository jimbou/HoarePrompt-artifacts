Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s` or `s+1`, and the key is `start+2*inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than `start+2*inc`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `start+2*inc` and `start` must be less than `end`. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is either 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. `mini` is 11111111.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
