The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `start` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` has key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s for all values of start from 0 to the length of `lst` minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with 1 input: a list of pairs of distinct integers does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `start` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` has key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s for all values of start from 0 to the length of `lst` minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with 1 input: a list of pairs of distinct integers**
