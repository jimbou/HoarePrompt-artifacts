Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `start` is 0, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst`, and `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `start` is less than the second last index of `lst`.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
