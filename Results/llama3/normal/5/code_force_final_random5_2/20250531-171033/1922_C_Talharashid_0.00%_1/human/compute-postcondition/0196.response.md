Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-m, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-m, inc is -1, s is 0, and m is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If start is less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the decremented end and start indices, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the decremented start and end indices. If start is not less than end, then s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the decremented end and start indices, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the decremented start and end indices, and the minimum of s1 and s2 is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same properties as the initial state, except for the loop counter `i`, which will be equal to `m`, and the range of possible values for `start` and `end`, which will be between 0 and `len(lst)-m`. The loop will have printed the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each iteration, where `s1` and `s2` are the absolute differences between the values of `d1` and `d2` at the decremented `start` and `end` indices, depending on whether `start` is less than `end` or not.
