Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s+1`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `start` is `start+inc` and `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is either 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` if `start - 1` is greater than -1. Otherwise, `mini` remains the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d1` now has the value `s+1` for the key `start+inc`. The other variables retain their original values and conditions.
