Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `start` is 0, `end` is greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`, stdin contains multiple test cases with 1 input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `inc`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its original value (11111111) and the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst`. The value of `start` is still 0, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases with 1 input.
