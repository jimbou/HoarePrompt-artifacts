Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is either greater than -1 or -1, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between the first and last elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `mini` is 11111111. The stdin contains no input. If the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in the list `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `s` is 0.***
