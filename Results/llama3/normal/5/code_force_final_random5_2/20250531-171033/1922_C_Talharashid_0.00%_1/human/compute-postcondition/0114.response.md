Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is greater than 0, inc is 1, start is start+inc, s is either 1 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], and mini is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between the first two elements of lst if lst has more than one element, and the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] if start is greater than -1, otherwise mini remains 11111111, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains greater than `m+1`, and `i` remains `m+1`. The dictionary `d1` now contains a single key-value pair where the key is the updated value of `start` (which is `start+inc`) and the value is `s`. The dictionary `d2` remains empty. The values of `n`, `lst`, `end`, and `inc` remain unchanged. The value of `start` has been incremented by `inc`. The value of `s` is either 1 or the sum of the absolute differences between the first two elements of `lst` and between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. The value of `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` (if `lst` has more than one element), and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` (if `start` is greater than -1); otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. The stdin now contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs.
