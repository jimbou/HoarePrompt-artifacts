Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has at least one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `start` is greater than 0, and `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between the `start`th and `(start-1)`th elements of `lst`.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between the `start`th and `(start-1)`th elements of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
