Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of `lst` and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is the first index of `lst`, `inc` is `-1`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to `0`, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s`. If `lst` has at least 3 elements, `start` is the second last index of `lst` and `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the last two elements of `lst` and `11111111`. Otherwise, `start` is the second last index of `lst` and `mini` is `11111111`. If `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the last two elements of `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. Additionally, the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` is not equal to `mini`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is updated by adding the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start + inc` in the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `lst` still has at least 2 elements, and the dictionaries `d1` and `d2` maintain their properties. The indices `start` and `end` are still the second last and first indices of `lst`, respectively. The value of `mini` is still the minimum of the absolute difference between the last two elements of `lst` and `11111111`, or the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`.
