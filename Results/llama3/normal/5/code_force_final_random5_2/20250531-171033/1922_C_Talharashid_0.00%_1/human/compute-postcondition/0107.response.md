Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is an empty dictionary, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `start` is greater than -1, `end` is greater than 0, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` if `lst` has more than one element, and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases with 1 input.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
