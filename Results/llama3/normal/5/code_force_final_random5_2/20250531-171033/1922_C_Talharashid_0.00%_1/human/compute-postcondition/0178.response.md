Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-1, end is an integer between 0 and len(lst)-1, inc is -1, s is 0, m is an integer greater than 0, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end.**

The code calculates the absolute differences between the values of `d2` at `end` and `start` and assigns it to `s1`, and the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at `start` and `end` and assigns it to `s2`. The values of `s1` and `s2` are determined by the values of `d2` and `d1` at the specified indices, which are not explicitly provided in the initial state. However, we can conclude that `s1` and `s2` will be non-negative integers, as they represent absolute differences. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
