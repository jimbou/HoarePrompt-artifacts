Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of `start` and the values are the values of `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `start` is 0, and `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `mini`, which is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element in the list `lst` and its previous value. The input in `stdin` remains unchanged, and the dictionaries `d1` and `d2` also retain their initial values.
