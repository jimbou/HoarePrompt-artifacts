Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+2, i is 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc] and the previous value of s, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, end is the first index of lst, inc is -1, m is an integer greater than 0, start is equal to end, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111 if start - 1 is less than the length of lst. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If start - 1 is greater than -1, then mini is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. If mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], then s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus 1. Otherwise, s is the sum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of s plus the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], s1 is the absolute difference between d2[end] and d2[start], s2 is the absolute difference between d1[start] and d1[end].**

The code calculates two new variables, s1 and s2, based on the values of d1 and d2. s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at the end and start indices, while s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at the start and end indices. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
