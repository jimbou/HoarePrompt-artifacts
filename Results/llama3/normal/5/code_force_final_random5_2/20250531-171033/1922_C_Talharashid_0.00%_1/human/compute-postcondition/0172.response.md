Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+1, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start+inc and the value is s, d2 is a dictionary with len(lst)-1 key-value pairs where the key is start and the value is s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is 0, inc is -1, start is 0, s is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst if mini is not equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), otherwise s is the number of times mini is equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), and m is an integer read from the input.**

In this output state, the value of m has been updated to an integer read from the input, and the value of i has been updated to m+1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains no input as it has been read.
