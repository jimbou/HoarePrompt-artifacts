Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `start` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` has key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s for all values of start from 0 to the length of `lst` minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with 1 input: a list of pairs of distinct integers.**

In this output state, the value of `m` is an integer that was read from the input. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains one less input, which is a list of pairs of distinct integers.
