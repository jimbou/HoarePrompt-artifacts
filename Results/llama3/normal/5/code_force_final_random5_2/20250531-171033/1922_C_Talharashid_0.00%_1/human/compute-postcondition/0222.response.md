Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the first key is `start+1` and the value is either `s+1` if `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`, or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` otherwise, and the second key is `start+1+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is either greater than 0 or 0 and `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `s` is 0, plus the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst` if `mini` is not equal to the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`. If `start` is greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start-1` in `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been incremented by `inc` (which is 1), and a new key-value pair has been added to the dictionary `d1`. The key is the new value of `start` (i.e., `start+1+inc`), and the value is `s`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
