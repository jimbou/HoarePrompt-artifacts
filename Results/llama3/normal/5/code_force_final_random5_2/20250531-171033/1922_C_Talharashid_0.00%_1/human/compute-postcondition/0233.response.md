Output State: **t is an integer greater than m+2, i is m+1, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of lst and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst is a non-empty list of integers, end is the last index of lst, inc is 1, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, start is equal to end, s is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in lst.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the dictionary `d1` will contain key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of the list `lst` and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`. The variable `s` will hold the total sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`. The variable `start` will be equal to `end`, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
