You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one more time, please simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10,  `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The variables in the loop head are i and n, so we can only adjust them.. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4,  `n` must be greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0,  students is 3 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variable in the loop head is variable students, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, students is 3 less than its initial value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 3 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, d1 is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the first key is the previous value of start and the value is the value of s plus 1 if mini equals the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], otherwise the value is the value of s, and the second key is the new value of start and the value is the value of s, d2 is an empty dictionary, n is an integer, lst has at least one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is 1, start is the value of start plus 1 and start must be less than end. If start is greater than 0, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start - 1] and the previous value of mini. If start + 1 is less than the length of lst, mini is the minimum of the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1] and 11111111. Otherwise, mini remains 11111111. Additionally, if mini is not equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc], s is increased by the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + 1].
```
while start != end:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
