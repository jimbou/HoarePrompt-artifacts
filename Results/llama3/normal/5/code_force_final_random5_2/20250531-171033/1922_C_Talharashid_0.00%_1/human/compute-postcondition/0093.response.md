Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 2, m is greater than 2, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, start is the value of start from stdin minus 1, end is the value of end from stdin minus 1, inc is -1, s is 0, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at end and start, s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at start and end, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between the values of `d1` and `d2` at the indices `start` and `end`, and assigns these differences to `s1` and `s2`, respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `m`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, and `s` remain unchanged. The code does not modify the input from stdin.
