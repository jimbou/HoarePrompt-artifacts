Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, m is greater than 0, d1 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of start and the values are the values of s, n is an integer, lst has more than one element, end is the length of lst minus 1, inc is -1, start is the length of lst minus 1 minus 1, s is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with 0 inputs, s1 is the absolute difference between the values of d2 at end and start, and s2 is the absolute difference between the values of d1 at start and end.**

In this output state, the values of `s1` and `s2` are calculated based on the differences between the values of `d2` and `d1` at the indices `end` and `start`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
