Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of `lst` and the values are the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `lst`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the indices of `lst` and the values are the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the previous value of `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is the first index of `lst`, `inc` is -1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is equal to `end`, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111 if `start - 1` is less than the length of `lst`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is updated to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `s` plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `m` is updated to be the integer input from the user. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin is now empty, meaning it contains no input.
