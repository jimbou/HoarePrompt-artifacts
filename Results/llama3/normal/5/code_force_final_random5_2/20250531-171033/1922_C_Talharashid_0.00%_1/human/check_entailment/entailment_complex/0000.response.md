Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another city. The program first calculates the cumulative sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list in both forward and backward directions. Then, for each pair of indices in the list, it prints the minimum of these sums.

The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when the start index is less than the end index, it calculates the absolute difference between the cumulative sums in the forward direction. When the start index is greater than the end index, it calculates the absolute difference between the cumulative sums in the backward direction.

The program also handles the case when the start index is equal to the end index correctly. In this case, it prints 0, which is the minimum number of coins needed to travel from a city to itself.

The time complexity of the program is O(n + m), where n is the number of cities and m is the number of queries. This is because the program iterates over the list of cities once to calculate the cumulative sums, and then iterates over the list of queries once to print the minimum number of coins needed for each query.

The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of cities. This is because the program uses two dictionaries to store the cumulative sums, and each dictionary has n key-value pairs.

Therefore, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
