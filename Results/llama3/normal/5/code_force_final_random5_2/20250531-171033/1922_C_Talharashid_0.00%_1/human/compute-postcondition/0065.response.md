Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of `start` and the values are the values of `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of `start` and the values are the values of `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `start` is either 0 or greater than 0 and `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is 2 if 11111111 is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is 1 plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value (11111111) and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
