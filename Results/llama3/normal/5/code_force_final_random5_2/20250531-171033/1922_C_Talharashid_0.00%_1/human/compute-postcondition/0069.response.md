Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of `start` and the values are the values of `s`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of `start` and the values are the values of `s`, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `start` is either 0 or greater than 0 and `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is 1 plus the value of `s` which is 2 if 11111111 is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, otherwise `s` is 1 plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, stdin contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of 11111111, the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` if `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The value of `s` is now 1 plus its previous value, which was either 2 or 1 plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
