Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+1`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs where the key is `start+inc` and the value is either `s+1` or `s+2` or `s+abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or `s+1+abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, the key is `start+2*inc` and the value is either `s+1` or `s+abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, and the key is `start+inc` and the value is `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is greater than `start+2*inc`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `start+inc` and `start` must be less than `end`. If `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is either 2 or 3 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1 or 2. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and 11111111. If `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is either 2 or 3 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1 or 2. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or 2 or the sum of the absolute difference between the first two elements of `lst` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

The code increments the value of `start` by `inc` (which is 1) and adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `d1` where the key is the new value of `start` and the value is `s`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
