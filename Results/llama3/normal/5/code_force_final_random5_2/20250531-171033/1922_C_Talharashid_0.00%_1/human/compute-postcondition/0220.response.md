Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than `m+2`, `i` is `m+1`, `d1` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `start+1` and the value is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, `end` is the last index of `lst`, `inc` is 1, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `start` is either greater than 0 or 0 and `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `lst` if the list has more than one element, otherwise `s` is 0, plus the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in `lst`. If `start` is greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start-1` in `lst` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start+inc` in the list `lst`. The dictionary `d1` has been updated to reflect this new value of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
