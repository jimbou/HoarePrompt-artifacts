Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with 2 inputs: an integer and a list of pairs of distinct integers, `d1` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are the values of `start` and the values are the values of `s`, `d2` is an empty dictionary, `n` is an integer, `lst` has more than one element, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 1. If the length of `lst` is more than 1, `start` is either 0 and `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`, or `start` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `start` is the length of `lst` minus 1. The current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

The code increments the value of `s` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is now 1. The rest of the conditions and variables remain the same as in the initial state.
