Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities. It first constructs two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, which store the cumulative cost of traveling from the first city to each subsequent city and from the last city to each preceding city, respectively. The program then uses these dictionaries to calculate the minimum cost of traveling between any two cities.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* Traveling from a city to a city that is closer to it than any other city (in which case the cost is 1)
* Traveling from a city to a city that is not closer to it than any other city (in which case the cost is the absolute difference between the two cities' coordinates)
* Traveling from the first city to any other city
* Traveling from the last city to any other city
* Traveling between any two cities in either direction

The program also correctly handles the case where the closest city to a given city is unique, as stated in the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
