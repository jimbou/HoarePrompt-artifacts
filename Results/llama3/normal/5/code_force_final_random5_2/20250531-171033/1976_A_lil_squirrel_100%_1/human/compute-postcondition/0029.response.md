The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `len(password)` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `len(password)` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 3 characters, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `i` is 2**
