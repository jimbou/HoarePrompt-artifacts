Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least 3 characters, `ch` is the third character in the `password` string. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is a list containing one lowercase Latin letter and `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string which is a digit, `ch`, and `ch`.

If `ch` is a digit, `digits` now contains the first character of the `password` string which is a digit, `ch`, and `ch`. If `ch` is not a digit, `digits` now contains `ch` and `ch`. The value of `letters` remains the same.
