Checks if a given password meets certain conditions and returns 'YES' if it does, otherwise returns 'NO'. The conditions are: (1) the password's letters are in ascending order, (2) the password's digits are in ascending order, and (3) no letter is immediately followed by a digit. The function takes a positive integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits as input.
