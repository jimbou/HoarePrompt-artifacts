The only variable in the loop head is `ch` and `password`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`.  If the password has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `password` has at least 1 character, `ch` is the first character in the `password` string. So for the loop to be executed one more time the password must have at least 2 characters and the `ch` is the second character in the `password` string.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least 2 characters, `ch` is the second character in the `password` string. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is a list containing one lowercase Latin letter and `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string which is a digit. If `ch` is not a digit, `letters` is a list containing two lowercase Latin letters and `digits` is an empty list.**
