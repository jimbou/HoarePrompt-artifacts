The code `letters.append(ch)` adds the character `ch` to the end of the list `letters`. Since `ch` is the first character in the `password` string and is not a digit, it is a lowercase Latin letter. Therefore, the list `letters` now contains one lowercase Latin letter.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The variable `n` is still a positive integer greater than 0, `password` is still a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is still the first character in the `password` string and is not a digit, and `digits` is still an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the first character in the `password` string and is not a digit, `letters` is a list containing one lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list**
