#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'.
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string. The list `letters` is sorted in ascending order.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string. The list `letters` is sorted in ascending order. The list `digits` is sorted in ascending order.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least `n` characters, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`. If the character at index `i` in `password` is a letter and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if a given password meets certain conditions and returns 'YES' if it does, otherwise returns 'NO'. The conditions are: (1) the password's letters are in ascending order, (2) the password's digits are in ascending order, and (3) no letter is immediately followed by a digit. The function takes a positive integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits as input.
