Reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
3. It defines a function `func_1` that takes the length `n` and the password as input.
4. Inside `func_1`, it initializes two empty lists `letters` and `digits` to store the letters and digits in the password, respectively.
5. It then iterates over each character `ch` in the password. If `ch` is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list; otherwise, it appends it to the `letters` list.
6. The function then checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted` function. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.
7. It does the same check for the `digits` list.
8. Next, it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password by iterating over the password and checking if the current character is a letter and the next character is a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
9. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
