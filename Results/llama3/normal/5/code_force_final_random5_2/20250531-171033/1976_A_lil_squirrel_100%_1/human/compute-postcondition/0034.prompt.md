You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'.
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string. The list `letters` is sorted in ascending order.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string. The list `letters` is sorted in ascending order. The list `digits` is sorted in ascending order.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least `n` characters, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`. If the character at index `i` in `password` is a letter and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'NO'.

Case_2: The program returns the string 'NO'

Case_3: `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least `n` characters, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`. If the character at index `i` in `password` is a letter and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.

Case_4: The program returns the string 'YES'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
