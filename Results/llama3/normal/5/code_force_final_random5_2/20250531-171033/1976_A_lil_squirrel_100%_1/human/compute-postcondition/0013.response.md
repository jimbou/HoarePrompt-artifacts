Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least 3 characters, `ch` is the third character in the `password` string. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is a list containing two elements: one lowercase Latin letter and `ch` and `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string which is a digit and `ch`. If `ch` is not a digit, `letters` is a list containing three lowercase Latin letters: two lowercase Latin letters and `ch` and `digits` is a list containing `ch`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `password` remains the same. The value of `ch` also remains the same. However, the value of `letters` has been updated. If `ch` is a digit, it now contains two elements: one lowercase Latin letter and `ch`. If `ch` is not a digit, it now contains three elements: two lowercase Latin letters and `ch`. The value of `digits` remains the same.
