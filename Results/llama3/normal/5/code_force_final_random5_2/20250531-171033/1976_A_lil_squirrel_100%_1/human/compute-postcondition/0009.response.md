Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least 2 characters, `ch` is the second character in the `password` string. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is a list containing two characters: one lowercase Latin letter and `ch` which is a digit, and `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string which is a digit. If `ch` is not a digit, `letters` is a list containing three lowercase Latin letters and `digits` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `password` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `ch` also remains the same. However, the list `letters` has been updated to include the second character `ch` of the `password` string. If `ch` is a digit, the list `letters` now contains two characters: one lowercase Latin letter and `ch` which is a digit. If `ch` is not a digit, the list `letters` now contains three lowercase Latin letters. The list `digits` remains the same as in the initial state.
