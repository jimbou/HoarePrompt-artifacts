To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `ch` and the string `password`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `password` is not empty. Since `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, we can conclude that `n` must be greater than 0.

At the start of the loop, `ch` will take the value of the first character in the `password` string.

The states of `letters` and `digits` do not affect the execution of the loop, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the first character in the `password` string, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list**
