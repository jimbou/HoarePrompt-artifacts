Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 3 characters, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `i` is 1. If the current character at index `i` in `password` is a letter and the next character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
