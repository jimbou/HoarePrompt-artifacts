Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks all the conditions specified in the problem description. It first separates the letters and digits in the password and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order. Then it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns 'NO', otherwise it returns 'YES'.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords with a mix of letters and digits. It also correctly handles passwords with repeated letters or digits.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and should return the expected output for all possible inputs.
