Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'.
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string. The list `letters` is sorted in ascending order.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string. The list `letters` is sorted in ascending order. The list `digits` is sorted in ascending order.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least `n` characters, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the initial `password` string in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`. If the character at index `i` in `password` is a letter and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if a given password meets certain conditions and returns 'YES' if it does, otherwise returns 'NO'. The conditions are: (1) the password's letters are in ascending order, (2) the password's digits are in ascending order, and (3) no letter is immediately followed by a digit. The function takes a positive integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits as input.
