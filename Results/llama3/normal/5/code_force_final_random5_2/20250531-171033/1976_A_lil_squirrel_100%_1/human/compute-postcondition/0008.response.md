Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least 2 characters, `ch` is the second character in the `password` string. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is a list containing one lowercase Latin letter and `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string which is a digit and `ch`. If `ch` is not a digit, `letters` is a list containing two lowercase Latin letters and `digits` is a list containing `ch`.**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `password`, and `ch` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `letters` and `digits` changes based on whether `ch` is a digit or not. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` now contains the first character of the `password` string which is a digit and `ch`, and `letters` remains the same. If `ch` is not a digit, `digits` now contains `ch`, and `letters` remains the same.
