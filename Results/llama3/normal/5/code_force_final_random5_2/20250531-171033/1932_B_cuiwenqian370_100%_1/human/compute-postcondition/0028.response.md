Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year and the string representation of last_year, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3] * a[3]), i is 3**

The code block modifies the value of `last_year` by assigning it the value of `next_year`, which is calculated based on the previous value of `last_year`, `a[i]`, and the integer division and multiplication operations. The value of `next_year` is calculated as `((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])`, where `i` is 3. This means that `next_year` is calculated using the value of `last_year` before the assignment, which is `((a[0] + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])`. 

After the assignment, `last_year` takes on the value of `next_year`, which is `((a[0] + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2] + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3] * a[3])`. 

No other variables are affected by the code block.
