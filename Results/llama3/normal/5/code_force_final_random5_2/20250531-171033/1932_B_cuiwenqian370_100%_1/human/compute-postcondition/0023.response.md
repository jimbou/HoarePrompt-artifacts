To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.

Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. However, since `i` is the loop variable, its value will be set to 1 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust its value.

The other variables, such as `T`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `a`, and `last_year`, are not directly related to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `index` is `n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is `a[0]`, `i` is 1**
