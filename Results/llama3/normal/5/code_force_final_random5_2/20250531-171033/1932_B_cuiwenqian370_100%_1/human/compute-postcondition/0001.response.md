According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the variable `_` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to be defined as an iteration variable.

State: **`stdin` is empty, `T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is an iteration variable**
