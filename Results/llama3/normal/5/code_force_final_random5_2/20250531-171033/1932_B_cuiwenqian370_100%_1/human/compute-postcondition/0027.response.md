To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The objects involved are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 3, it remains the same.

The other variables in the state (`T`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `a`, and `last_year`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `index` is n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is ((a[0] + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), `i` is 3**
