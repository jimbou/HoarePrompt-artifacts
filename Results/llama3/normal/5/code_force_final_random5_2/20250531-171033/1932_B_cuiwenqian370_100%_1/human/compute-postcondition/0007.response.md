To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `T`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `a`, and `last_year`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `_` is an iteration variable, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is ((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), `i` is 3**
