Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program reads input from standard input, processes it, and writes the results to standard output.

The program's logic is as follows:

1.  It reads the number of test cases (T) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of signs (n) and the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
3.  It initializes the last year to the periodicity of the first sign (a_0).
4.  It then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second sign to the n-th sign). For each sign, it calculates the next year by rounding up the previous year to the nearest multiple of the current year's periodicity.
5.  It updates the last year to the calculated next year.
6.  After processing all signs, it appends the last year as a string to a list of results.
7.  Finally, it writes the list of results to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character.

The program's logic correctly implements the problem's requirements. It accurately calculates the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur by iteratively rounding up the previous year to the nearest multiple of the current year's periodicity.

Correctness: **True**
