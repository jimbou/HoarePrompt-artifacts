Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input data from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read()`. This is a valid approach, as the problem statement does not specify any particular input method.

2. The program splits the input data into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This is correct, as the input data is expected to be a sequence of space-separated integers.

3. The program iterates over the test cases using a `for` loop. In each iteration, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a` from the input data. This is correct, as the problem statement specifies that each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the number of signs, and the second line contains the periodicities of the signs.

4. The program initializes the `last_year` variable to the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`. This is correct, as the problem statement specifies that the tribe waits for the first sign to occur in the year `a[0]`.

5. The program iterates over the remaining signs using a `for` loop. In each iteration, it calculates the next year in which the current sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This is correct, as the problem statement specifies that the tribe waits for the current sign to occur in the year that is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

6. The program updates the `last_year` variable to the calculated next year. This is correct, as the problem statement specifies that the tribe waits for the next sign to occur after the current sign has occurred.

7. The program appends the final year in which the n-th sign will occur to the `results` list. This is correct, as the problem statement specifies that the output should be the year in which all n signs will occur.

8. The program writes the results to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`. This is correct, as the problem statement does not specify any particular output method.

Based on the above analysis, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
