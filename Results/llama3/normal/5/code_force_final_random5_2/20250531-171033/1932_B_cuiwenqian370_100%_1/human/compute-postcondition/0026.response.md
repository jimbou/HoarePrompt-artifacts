Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year and the string representation of last_year, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), i is 2**

The code block modifies the value of `last_year` by assigning it the value of `next_year`, which is calculated based on the previous value of `last_year`, `a[i]`, and the index `i`. The value of `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to the third element in the list `a`. The expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` calculates a new value for `last_year` by adding 1 to the previous value, then adding the third element of `a` minus 1, dividing the result by the third element of `a`, and finally multiplying by the third element of `a`. This new value is then assigned to `last_year`.

No other variables are affected by the code block. The values of `T`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
