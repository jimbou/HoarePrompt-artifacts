Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of next_year, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((next_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is 2**

In this output state, the value of `last_year` has been updated to `next_year`, which is calculated based on the previous value of `last_year`, `a[i]`, and the integer division and multiplication operations. The value of `next_year` is not explicitly stored, but its value is used to update `last_year`. All other variables remain unchanged.
