To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `index` is `n + 2`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `_` is an iteration variable, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is an integer, `i` is 1**
