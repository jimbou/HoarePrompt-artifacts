Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, calculating the year when each sign will occur based on the previous sign's year. The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` correctly determines the next year when the current sign will occur, taking into account the fact that the tribe starts waiting for the next sign from the year after the previous sign occurred.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the periodicities are all 1, the program correctly outputs the number of signs (e.g., the third example in the problem statement).
* When the periodicities are all different, the program correctly calculates the year when each sign will occur (e.g., the first example in the problem statement).
* When the periodicities are a mix of 1 and other values, the program correctly handles the cases where the next sign occurs in the same year as the previous sign (e.g., the second example in the problem statement).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
