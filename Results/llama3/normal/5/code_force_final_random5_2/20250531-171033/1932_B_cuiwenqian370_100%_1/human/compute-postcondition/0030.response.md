Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year three times, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still an integer between 2 and 1000, index is still n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1, results now contains three string representations of last_year, _ is still 2, n is still an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is still a list of n integers, last_year is still ((a[0] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), and i is still n-1.
