Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year and the string representation of last_year, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, and in each iteration, it updates the value of last_year and i. After the loop finishes, last_year will be the result of the calculation ((a[0] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), and i will be n-1. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
