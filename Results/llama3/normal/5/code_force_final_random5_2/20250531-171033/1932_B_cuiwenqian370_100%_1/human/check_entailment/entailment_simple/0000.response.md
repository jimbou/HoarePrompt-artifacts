Reasoning: 
The program is correct. It correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program iterates through each sign, calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, and updates the last year accordingly. The final result is the last year calculated, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Correctness: **True**
