Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is an iteration variable, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string representation of `last_year`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains a single element, which is the string representation of the value of `last_year`. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
