Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year and the string representation of last_year, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]), i is 1**

The code calculates the next year based on the last year and the current year's value in the list `a`, then updates the last year to be the next year. The value of `last_year` is updated to be the calculated next year, which is `((a[0] + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1])`. No other variables are affected by the code.
