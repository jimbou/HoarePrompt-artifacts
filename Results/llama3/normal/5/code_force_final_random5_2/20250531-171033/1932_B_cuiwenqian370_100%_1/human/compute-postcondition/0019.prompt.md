Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is a[0], i is n-1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
    last_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]), i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of next_year, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((next_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of next_year, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((next_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]), i is 3, next_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
