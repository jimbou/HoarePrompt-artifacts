Output State: **T is 0, index is 0, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year T times, _ is -1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1, and the string representation of last_year T times is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the string representation of the elements in the `results` list to the standard output, separated by newline characters, and followed by an additional newline character. Since `results` contains the string representation of `last_year` T times, and T is 0, the output will be an empty string followed by a newline character. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
