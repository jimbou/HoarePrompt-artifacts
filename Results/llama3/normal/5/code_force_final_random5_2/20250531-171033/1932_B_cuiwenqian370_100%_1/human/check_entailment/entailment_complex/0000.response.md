Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases `T`, the number of signs `n`, and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. The program initializes the `last_year` variable to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. The program then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next year by rounding up the previous year to the nearest multiple of the current sign's periodicity. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.

4. The program appends the final `last_year` value as a string to the `results` list.

5. Finally, the program writes the list of results to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
