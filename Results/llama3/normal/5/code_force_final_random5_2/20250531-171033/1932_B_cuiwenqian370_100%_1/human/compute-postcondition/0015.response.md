The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]), i is 2**
