To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`T`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `a`, and `last_year`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `index` is n + 2 + n + 1, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `next_year`, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is ((`next_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i]` * `a[i]`), `i` is 3**
