The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified but we can assume it is equal to 1 because the loop has executed at least once, `T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` must be increased by 1 and `T` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1**
