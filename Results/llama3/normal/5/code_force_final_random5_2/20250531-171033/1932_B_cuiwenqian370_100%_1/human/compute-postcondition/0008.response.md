Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2, results is an empty list, _ is an iteration variable, n is greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3] * a[3]), i is 3**

In this output state, the value of `last_year` has been updated to be the next year after the previous `last_year`, calculated using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, where `i` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
