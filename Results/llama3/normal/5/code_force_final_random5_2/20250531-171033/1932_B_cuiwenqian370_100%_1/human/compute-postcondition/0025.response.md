To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 1, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we know that `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `index` is `n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is `((a[0] + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1])`, `i` is 2**
