Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2, results is an empty list, _ is an iteration variable, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variable last_year, which has been updated to be the result of the calculation ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), and the variable i, which has been updated to be n-1.
