Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2, results is an empty list, _ is an iteration variable, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is an integer**.

The code block has the following effects on the program state:

*   The first line assigns the integer value at `data[index]` to `n`. This means `n` is now an integer, and its value is determined by the data at the current index.
*   The second line increments `index` by 1, so `index` is now `n + 1`.
*   The third line assigns a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]` to `a`. This means `a` is now a list of `n` integers, and its values are determined by the data at the current index and the next `n-1` indices.
*   The fourth line increments `index` by `n`, so `index` is now `n + 2`.
*   The fifth line assigns the first element of `a` to `last_year`. This means `last_year` is now an integer, and its value is the first element of the list `a`.

The variables `T`, `results`, and `_` are not modified by the code block, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
