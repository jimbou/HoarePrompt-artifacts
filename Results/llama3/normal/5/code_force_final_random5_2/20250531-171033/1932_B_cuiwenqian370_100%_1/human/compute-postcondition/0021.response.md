To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(T):`, so we can only adjust the state of `_` and `T`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `T` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `T` remains the same.

State: **`T` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `index` is n + 2 + n + 1, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `last_year` is ((a[n-1] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), `i` is n-1**
