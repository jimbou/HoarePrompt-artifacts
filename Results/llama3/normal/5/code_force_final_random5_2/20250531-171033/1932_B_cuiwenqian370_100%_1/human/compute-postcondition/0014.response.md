Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[0] + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]), i is 1**

The code modifies the value of `last_year` by assigning it the value of `next_year`, which is calculated based on the previous value of `last_year` and the value of `a[i]`. The new value of `last_year` is `((a[0] + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
