Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year and the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is ((a[n-1] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), i is n-1**

The code appends the string representation of last_year to the results list. The value of last_year is calculated as ((a[n-1] + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]), which is a combination of the values of a[n-1] and the integer n. The other variables remain unchanged.
