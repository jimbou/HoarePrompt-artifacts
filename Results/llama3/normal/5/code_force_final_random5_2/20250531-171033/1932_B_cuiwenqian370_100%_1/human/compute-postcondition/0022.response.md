Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year and the string representation of last_year, _ is 2, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is a[0], i is n-1**

In this output state, the value of `T` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `index` is incremented by `n + 1` due to the two increments in the code, resulting in `n + 2 + n + 1 + n + 1`. The `results` list remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` remains 2 as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value at `data[index]`, and the value of `a` is updated to a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`. The value of `last_year` is updated to the first element of the list `a`, which is `a[0]`. The value of `i` remains `n-1` as it is not affected by the code.
