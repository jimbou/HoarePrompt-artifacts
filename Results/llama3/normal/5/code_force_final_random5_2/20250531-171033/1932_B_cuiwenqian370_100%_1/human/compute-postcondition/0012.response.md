Output State: **T is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), index is n + 2 + n + 1, results is a list containing the string representation of last_year, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, last_year is a[0], i is n-1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `a`, `index`, and `last_year`. The first line assigns the integer value at `data[index]` to `n`, overwriting its previous value. The second line increments `index` by 1. The third line assigns a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]` to `a`, replacing its previous value. The fourth line increments `index` by `n`. The fifth line assigns the value of `a[0]` to `last_year`, replacing its previous value.

The values of `T`, `results`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `T` is still an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). The value of `results` is still a list containing the string representation of `last_year`. The value of `_` is still 1. The value of `i` is still `n-1`.
