Output State: **test_cases is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, results is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 2 divided by 6, n is an integer, num_list is a list that must have at least 2 elements, x is not defined, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, total_count is 0, res is 0, and stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads a list of integers from the input, splits them into individual integers using the `split()` method, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `num_list`. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`.

The initial state's variables `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `total_count`, and `res` are not affected by the code snippet. The variable `num_of_lens` is reset to an empty dictionary, and `num_list` is assigned a new list of integers. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input integer. The `stdin` remains empty as no input is read after the code execution.
