Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, `total_count` is 0, `res` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code increments the value of `x` in the `num_of_lens` dictionary by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `test_cases` list still has at least 2 sublists of integers, the `results` list still contains the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is still an integer, `num_list` still has at least 2 elements, `x` is still the second element in `num_list`, `total_count` is still 0, `res` is still 0, and `stdin` still contains no input.
