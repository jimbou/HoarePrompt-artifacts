Postcondition: ***`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.***
