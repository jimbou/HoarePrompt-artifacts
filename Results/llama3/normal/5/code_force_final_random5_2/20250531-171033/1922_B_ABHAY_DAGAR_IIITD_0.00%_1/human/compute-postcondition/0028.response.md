Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code increments the value of `res` by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise it remains unchanged. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `x`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count` remain the same as in the initial state.
