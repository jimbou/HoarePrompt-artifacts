Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys. The value of each key in `num_of_lens` is the number of times the corresponding integer appears in `num_list`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain a count of each unique integer in the `num_list`. The `x` variable will hold the last integer in `num_list` that was processed by the loop. The other variables (`results`, `test_cases`, and `n`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
