Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise the first element is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is 1, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `num_of_lens` now has a key-value pair where the key is `x` (the third element in `num_list`) and the value is 1. The rest of the variables maintain their initial state.
