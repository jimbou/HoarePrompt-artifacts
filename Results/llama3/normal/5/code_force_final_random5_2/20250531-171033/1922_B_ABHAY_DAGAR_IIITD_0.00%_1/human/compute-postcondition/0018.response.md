Output State: **test_cases is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, x is not defined, num_of_lens is a dictionary that contains all elements in num_list as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in num_list, res is 0, total_count is 0, and stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `res` and `total_count`, and assigns them the value 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
