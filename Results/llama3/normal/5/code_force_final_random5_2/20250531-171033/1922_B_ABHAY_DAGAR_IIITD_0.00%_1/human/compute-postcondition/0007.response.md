Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value of 1, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens` has been updated to include `x` as a key with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `x` is not in `num_of_lens` is no longer valid, as `x` is now a key in `num_of_lens`.
