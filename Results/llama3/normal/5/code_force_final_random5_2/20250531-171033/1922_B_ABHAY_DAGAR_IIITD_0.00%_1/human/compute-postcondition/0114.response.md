Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least three values, `total_count` is equal to the third value in `num_of_lens` plus `cnt`, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2`, divided by 6, where `cnt` is the third value in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. All other variables remain unchanged.
