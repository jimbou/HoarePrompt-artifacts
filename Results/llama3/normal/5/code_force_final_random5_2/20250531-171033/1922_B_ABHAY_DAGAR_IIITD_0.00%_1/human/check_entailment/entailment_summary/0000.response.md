Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of sticks in each test case, and the lengths of the sticks.

2. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is an efficient way to handle the input, as it allows the program to easily calculate the number of ways to choose sticks of the same length.

3. The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. This is correct, as it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from a set of `cnt` items.

4. The program also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using the formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. This is correct, as it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of `cnt` items and then multiplies it by the total number of sticks of different lengths.

5. The program correctly accumulates the results for each test case and prints them out.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its execution summary accurately describes its behavior.

Correctness: **True**
