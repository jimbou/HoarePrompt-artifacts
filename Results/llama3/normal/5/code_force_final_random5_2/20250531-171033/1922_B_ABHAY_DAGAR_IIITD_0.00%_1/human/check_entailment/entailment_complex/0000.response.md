Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each stick length, and then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length and the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length. The program also correctly handles the case where there are less than 3 sticks of the same length.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the mathematical formulas for calculating the number of ways to choose 3 sticks. The program also correctly handles the input and output, reading the test cases from standard input and printing the results to the console.

Correctness: **True**
