To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for x in num_list:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of `num_list`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second element in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key with a value increased by 1 if the first element already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise the first element is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state of `x` and `num_of_lens`.

Since `x` is the second element in `num_list`, for the loop to execute again, `x` should be the third element in `num_list`. Therefore, `num_list` must have at least 3 elements.

Additionally, if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` should be increased by 1. Otherwise, `x` should be added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise the first element is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1 if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, otherwise `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and `stdin` contains no input.**
