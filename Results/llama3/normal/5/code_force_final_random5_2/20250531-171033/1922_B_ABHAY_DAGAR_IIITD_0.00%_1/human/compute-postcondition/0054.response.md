Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, `total_count` is 0, `res` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input.**

The value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is unknown, so the output state is: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
