To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for x in num_list:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `num_list` has at least 2 elements, and `x` is the first element in `num_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` must be the second element in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key and the value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is 0, `res` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input.**
