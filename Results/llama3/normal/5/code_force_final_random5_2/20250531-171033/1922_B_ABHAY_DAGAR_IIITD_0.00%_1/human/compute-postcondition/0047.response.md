Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value of 1, `total_count` is 0, `res` is 0, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code adds a new key-value pair to the `num_of_lens` dictionary, where the key is `x` (the first element in `num_list`) and the value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
