Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then calculates the sum of the products of each value in the list and the sum of the products of each value minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value minus 2 divided by 6. The results are stored in a list and printed out one by one. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the results directly to the console.**
