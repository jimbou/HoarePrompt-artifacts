Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list` and has at least 2 values, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `res` is increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by adding the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6 to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is still the second value in the dictionary `num_of_lens`, which contains the counts of each element in `num_list`.
