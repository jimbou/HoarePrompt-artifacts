Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least one value, `total_count` is equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is equal to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt`. Otherwise, no new element is appended to `results`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total count has been updated to be equal to the first value in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. All other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list still has a new element `res` appended to it if the first value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `res` is calculated based on the updated `total_count`.
