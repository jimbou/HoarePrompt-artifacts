The only object in the loop head is variable `x` and list `num_list`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `num_list`. If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_list` has at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and `x` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.**
