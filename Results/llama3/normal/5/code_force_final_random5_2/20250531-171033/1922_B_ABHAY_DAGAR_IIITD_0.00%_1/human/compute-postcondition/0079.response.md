Output State: **The final state of the variables after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:**

*   `test_cases` remains a list of lists of integers with at least 2 sublists.
*   `results` remains a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6.
*   `n` remains an integer.
*   `num_list` remains a list with at least 2 elements.
*   `x` remains the last element in `num_list`.
*   `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the value of `x` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`.
*   `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.
*   `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for each `cnt` greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for each `cnt` greater than or equal to 2.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged, while the variables in the loop head and body are updated based on the loop's logic. The `total_count` variable accumulates the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and the `res` variable accumulates the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, plus additional terms based on the values of `cnt`.
