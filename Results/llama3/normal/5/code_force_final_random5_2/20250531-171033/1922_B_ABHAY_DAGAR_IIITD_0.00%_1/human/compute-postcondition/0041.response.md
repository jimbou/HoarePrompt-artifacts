To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`. The only object in the loop head is `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist.

For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 2 sublists.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list` and has at least 2 values, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, and `stdin` contains no input.**
