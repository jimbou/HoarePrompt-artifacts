Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, results is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 2 divided by 6, n is an integer, num_list is a list that must have at least 2 elements, x is not defined, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, total_count is 0, res is 0, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, results is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 2 divided by 6, n is an integer, num_list is a list that must have at least 2 elements, x is the first element in num_list, num_of_lens is a dictionary where x is a key and the value of x in num_of_lens is either increased by 1 if x was already a key in num_of_lens or set to 1 if x was not a key in num_of_lens, total_count is 0, res is 0, and stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is 0, `res` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value of `x` in `num_of_lens` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is 0, `res` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
