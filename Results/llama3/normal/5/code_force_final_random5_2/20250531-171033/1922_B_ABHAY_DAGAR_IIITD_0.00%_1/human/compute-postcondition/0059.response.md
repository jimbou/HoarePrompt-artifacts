To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. The loop will execute as long as `num_of_lens` has at least one value. Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value of `x` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, and `x` is the last element in `num_list`, we can infer that `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the value of `x` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is 0, `res` is 0, `cnt` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`**
