Output State: **results has a new element res appended to it, test_cases is greater than 1, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers, x is the last integer in num_list, num_of_lens is a dictionary that contains all integers in num_list as keys, res is 0, and total_count is 0.**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `res` and `total_count`, and assigns them the value 0. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged. The `results` list still has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is still greater than 1, `n` is still an integer, `num_list` is still a list of integers, `x` is still the last integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is still a dictionary containing all integers in `num_list` as keys with their respective counts.
