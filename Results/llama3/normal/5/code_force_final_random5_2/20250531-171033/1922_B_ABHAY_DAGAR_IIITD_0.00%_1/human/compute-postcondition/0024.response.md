Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is 0, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, and `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been updated. The value of `res` is increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `total_count` divided by 2. The value of `cnt` is still greater than or equal to 2, and if it is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is also increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
