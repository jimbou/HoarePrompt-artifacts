Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list` and has at least 2 values, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `test_cases` and `results` lists remain unchanged, `n` remains an integer, `num_list` has at least two elements, `x` is still undefined, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two values. The `total_count` variable is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and the `res` variable is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6. The `stdin` input remains empty.
