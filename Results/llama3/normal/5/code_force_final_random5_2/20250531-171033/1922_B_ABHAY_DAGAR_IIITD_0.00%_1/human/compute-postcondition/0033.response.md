The only variable in the loop head is variable  cnt, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least 2 values the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` has at least 1 value, `cnt` is a value in `num_of_lens`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `num_of_lens` must have at least 2 values and the `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list` and has at least 2 values, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`**
