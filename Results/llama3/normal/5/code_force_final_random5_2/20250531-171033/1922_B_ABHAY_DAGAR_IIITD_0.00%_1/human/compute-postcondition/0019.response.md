The only object in the loop head is `num_of_lens`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least one value, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num_list` is empty, which means `num_of_lens` is also empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num_list` to have at least one element, and consequently, `num_of_lens` will have at least one value.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input**
