Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of `x` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if `x` already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and `stdin` contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise the first element is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise the first element is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 2 if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens` and exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and `stdin` contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
