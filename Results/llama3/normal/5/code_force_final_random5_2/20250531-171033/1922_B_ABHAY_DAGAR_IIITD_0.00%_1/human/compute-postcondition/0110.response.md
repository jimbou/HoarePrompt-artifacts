Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least two values, `total_count` is equal to the second value in `num_of_lens`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been updated by adding the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `total_count` divided by 2 to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list still has a new element `res` appended to it, and the other variables maintain their initial values and relationships.
