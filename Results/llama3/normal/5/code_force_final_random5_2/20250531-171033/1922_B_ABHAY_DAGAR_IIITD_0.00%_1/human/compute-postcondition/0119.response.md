Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys, `total_count` is equal to the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and `res` is the sum of all `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `results` list has a new element `res` appended to it, which is the sum of all combinations of three and two elements from the `num_list` that appear at least three and two times respectively. The `total_count` variable is the sum of all values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary, which represents the total count of all elements in the `num_list`. The other variables remain unchanged.
