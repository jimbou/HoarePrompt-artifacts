Output State: **test_cases is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, results is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 2 divided by 6, n is an integer, num_list is a list that must have at least 2 elements, x is the last element in num_list, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the value of x in num_of_lens is either increased by 1 if x was already a key in num_of_lens or set to 1 if x was not a key in num_of_lens, total_count is 0, res is 0**

The code snippet provided does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. The first two lines, `res = 0` and `total_count = 0`, assign the value 0 to the variables `res` and `total_count`, respectively. However, since `res` and `total_count` were already 0 in the initial state, these assignments do not change their values. The rest of the variables remain unaffected by the code.
