Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of `x` as a key and its value is increased by 1, `stdin` contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, but the values of the other variables are not affected. The `num_of_lens` dictionary still contains the value of `x` as a key, but its value is now incremented by 1. The rest of the variables maintain their initial state.
