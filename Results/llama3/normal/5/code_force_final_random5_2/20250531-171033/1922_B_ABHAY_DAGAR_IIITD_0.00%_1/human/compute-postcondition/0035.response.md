Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list` and has at least 2 values. If the second value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the product of the second value in `num_of_lens`, the second value in `num_of_lens` minus 1, and the second value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6.***
