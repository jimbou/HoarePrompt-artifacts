Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise the first element is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 2 if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, otherwise `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 2, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for the dictionary `num_of_lens`. The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, meaning that if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is now 2, and if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is now added with a value of 2.
