Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is an empty list, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. `num_list` is now an empty list because the loop has iterated over all its elements. `x` is no longer defined because it was only defined within the loop. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all unique elements from `num_list` as keys, and their values represent the frequency of each element in `num_list`.
