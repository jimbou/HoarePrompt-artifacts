Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. 

Here's why:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each stick length and stores them in a dictionary `num_of_lens`.

2. Then, it iterates over the counts of each stick length. If a stick length occurs at least 3 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and adds it to the result.

3. If a stick length occurs at least 2 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using the formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` and adds it to the result. Here, `total_count` is the total number of sticks of different lengths.

4. Finally, it prints the total number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the cases where a stick length occurs less than 2 times, and the cases where there are less than 3 sticks of different lengths. 

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
