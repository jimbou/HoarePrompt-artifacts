Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `total_count` is increased by `cnt` and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, `total_count` is increased by `cnt` and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, no changes are made. Additionally, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `total_count` has been increased by the value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
