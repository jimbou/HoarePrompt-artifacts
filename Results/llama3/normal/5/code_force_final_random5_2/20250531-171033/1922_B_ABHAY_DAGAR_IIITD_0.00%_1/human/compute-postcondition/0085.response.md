The code `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by 1. Since `x` is the first integer in `num_list` and it is also a key in `num_of_lens`, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `x` from `num_list` as a key with its value incremented by 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, and the current value of `x` is the first integer in `num_list` and it is also a key in `num_of_lens`.**
