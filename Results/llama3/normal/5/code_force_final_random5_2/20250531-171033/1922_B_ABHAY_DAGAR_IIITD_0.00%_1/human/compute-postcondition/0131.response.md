Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and all elements in the `results` list have been printed. The `result` variable is no longer defined, and the loop has terminated.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed its execution, and all the elements in the `results` list have been printed to the console. The `result` variable, which was used to store the current element being processed in each iteration, is no longer defined, indicating that the loop has finished its execution. The state of the other variables, such as `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `x`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `res`, and `stdin`, remains unchanged, as they were not affected by the loop.
