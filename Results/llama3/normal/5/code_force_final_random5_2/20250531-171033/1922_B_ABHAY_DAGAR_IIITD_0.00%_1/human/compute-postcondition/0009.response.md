To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for x in num_list:`. The only variable in the loop head is `x` and `num_list`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_list` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `num_list`. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, `num_list` must have at least 2 elements and `x` is the second element in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise the first element is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and `stdin` contains no input.**
