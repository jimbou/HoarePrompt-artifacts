The code initializes an empty list called `results`. This list is not related to the existing variable `test_cases`. The value of `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where the first element of each sublist is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5) and the second element is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n), `results` is an empty list**
