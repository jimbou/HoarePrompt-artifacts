Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where the value of `x` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is `cnt_new + cnt + cnt`, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus `cnt_new * (cnt_new - 1) * (cnt_new - 2) // 6` if `cnt_new` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `cnt` is the value of the third key-value pair in `num_of_lens`, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus `cnt_new * (cnt_new - 1) * (cnt_new - 2) // 6` if `cnt_new` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0.**

The code increments the `total_count` by `cnt`, which means the new value of `total_count` is `cnt_new + cnt + cnt`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
