Postcondition: ***`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least two values, `total_count` is equal to the second value in `num_of_lens`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res`.***
