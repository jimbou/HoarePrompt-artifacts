Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and 1 as its value, `stdin` contains no inputs, `x` is the first integer in `num_list` and `x` is in `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens` has been updated to include `x` as a key with a value of 1, indicating that the length of `x` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `results` still having a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` still greater than 1, `n` still an integer, `num_list` still a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `stdin` still containing no inputs, and `x` still the first integer in `num_list`.
