To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values():`. This means we can only adjust the states of `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`. Since `num_list` must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` must have at least 1 key-value pair.

For the loop to execute again, `num_of_lens` must have at least one more key-value pair. This means `num_list` must have at least one more element.

As for `cnt`, it is a value in `num_of_lens`. At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is a value in `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must be the next value in `num_of_lens`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, and `stdin` contains no input. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6. Otherwise, no changes are made, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens`.**
