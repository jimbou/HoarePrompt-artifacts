Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: results has a new element res appended to it, test_cases is greater than 1, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers, x is the last integer in num_list, num_of_lens is a dictionary that contains all integers in num_list as keys, res is 0, and total_count is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least one value, `total_count` is equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is equal to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt`. Otherwise, no new element is appended to `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least two values, `total_count` is equal to the second value in `num_of_lens` plus `cnt`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least three values, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is equal to the third value in `num_of_lens` plus `cnt` plus `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
