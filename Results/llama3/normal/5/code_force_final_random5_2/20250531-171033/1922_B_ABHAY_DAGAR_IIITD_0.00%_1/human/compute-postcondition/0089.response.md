To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `num_list`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_list` has at least 1 integer, and `x` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `num_list` must have at least 2 integers, and `x` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `x` is the second integer in `num_list`. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key, if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.**
