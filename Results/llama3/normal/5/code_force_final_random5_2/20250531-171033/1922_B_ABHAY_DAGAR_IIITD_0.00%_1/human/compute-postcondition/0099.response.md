To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least one value, the loop will execute.

State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least one value, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, and `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`**
