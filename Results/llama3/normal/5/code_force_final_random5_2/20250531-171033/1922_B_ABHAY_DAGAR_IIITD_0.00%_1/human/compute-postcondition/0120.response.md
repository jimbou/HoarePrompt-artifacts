Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys, `total_count` is equal to the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and `res` is the sum of all `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.**

The code appends the value of `res` to the `results` list. The value of `res` is the sum of all `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for all `cnt` in `num_of_lens` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `test_cases` is decremented by 1, so it is now greater than 0.
