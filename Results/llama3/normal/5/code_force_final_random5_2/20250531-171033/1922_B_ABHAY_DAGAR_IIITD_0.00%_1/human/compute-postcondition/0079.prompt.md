Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, results is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in num_of_lens minus 2 divided by 6, n is an integer, num_list is a list that must have at least 2 elements, x is the last element in num_list, num_of_lens is a dictionary where the value of x in num_of_lens is either increased by 1 if x was already a key in num_of_lens or set to 1 if x was not a key in num_of_lens, total_count is 0, res is 0
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the value of `x` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is `cnt`, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `cnt` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where the value of `x` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is `cnt_new + cnt`, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus `cnt_new * (cnt_new - 1) * (cnt_new - 2) // 6` if `cnt_new` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt_new`, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where the value of `x` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is `cnt_new + cnt + cnt`, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus `cnt_new * (cnt_new - 1) * (cnt_new - 2) // 6` if `cnt_new` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `cnt` is the value of the third key-value pair in `num_of_lens`, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus `cnt_new * (cnt_new - 1) * (cnt_new - 2) // 6` if `cnt_new` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
