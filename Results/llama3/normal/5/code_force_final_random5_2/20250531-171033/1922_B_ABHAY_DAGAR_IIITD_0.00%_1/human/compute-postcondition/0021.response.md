Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is 0, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is increased by the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6, where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
