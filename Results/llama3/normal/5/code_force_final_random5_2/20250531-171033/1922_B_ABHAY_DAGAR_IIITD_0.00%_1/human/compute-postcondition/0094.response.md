Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key with its value incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1, regardless of whether `x` was already in `num_of_lens` or not. The other variables remain unchanged.
