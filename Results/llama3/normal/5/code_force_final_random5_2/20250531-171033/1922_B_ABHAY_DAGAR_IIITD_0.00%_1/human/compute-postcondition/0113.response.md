The only object in the loop head is variable  cnt, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num_of_lens.  If the dictionary has at least 3 values the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, num_of_lens has at least two values, cnt is the second value in num_of_lens. So for the loop to be executed one more time the dictionary must have at least 3 values and the cnt is the third value in num_of_lens.
State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least three values, `total_count` is equal to the third value in `num_of_lens` plus `cnt`, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`.**
