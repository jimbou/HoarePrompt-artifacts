To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `num_list`. The loop will execute if `num_list` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num_list` to have at least one element, and `x` should be the first element in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains no input**
