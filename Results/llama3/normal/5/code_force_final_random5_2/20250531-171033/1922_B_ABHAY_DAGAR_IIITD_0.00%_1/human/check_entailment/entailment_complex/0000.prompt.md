Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1

    3 2 1 3

    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
func_1(t)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of lists of integers, where the first element of each sublist is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5) and the second element is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        
        total_count = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        
        results.append(res)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 for each iteration of the loop, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list` and has at least 2 values, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, and `stdin` contains no input.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and all elements in the `results` list have been printed. The `result` variable is no longer defined, and the loop has terminated.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then calculates the sum of the products of each value in the list and the sum of the products of each value minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value minus 2 divided by 6. The results are stored in a list and printed out one by one. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the results directly to the console.
