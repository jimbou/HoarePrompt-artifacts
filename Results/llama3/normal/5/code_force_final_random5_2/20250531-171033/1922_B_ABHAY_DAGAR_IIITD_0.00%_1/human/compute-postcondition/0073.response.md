The only variable in the loop head is variable  cnt, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least 3 key-value pairs the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` has at least 2 key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the last key-value pair in `num_of_lens`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `num_of_lens` must have at least 3 key-value pairs and the `cnt` is the value of the third key-value pair in `num_of_lens`.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs where the value of `x` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is `cnt_new + cnt`, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus `cnt_new * (cnt_new - 1) * (cnt_new - 2) // 6` if `cnt_new` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `cnt` is the value of the third key-value pair in `num_of_lens`, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**
