Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list` and has at least 2 values. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 and the second value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the product of the second value in `num_of_lens`, the second value in `num_of_lens` minus 1, and the second value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6. Otherwise, `res` remains the same. `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `total_count`, which has been incremented by the value of `cnt`. The conditions for `res` to be increased or remain the same are still valid, but the actual value of `res` is not specified as it depends on the values of `cnt` and the second value in `num_of_lens`, which are not provided.
