Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise the first element is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and `num_of_lens` also contains `x` as a key with a value of 1, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, except for `num_of_lens`, which now also contains `x` as a key with a value of 1. This means that `num_of_lens` now has at least two keys: the first element of `num_list` and `x`, with their respective values.
