Output State: **results has a new element res appended to it, test_cases is greater than 1, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no inputs**.

In this output state, the list `results` still has a new element `res` appended to it, and `test_cases` remains greater than 1, as these values were not modified by the code. The variable `n` is now an integer, assigned from the first input in stdin. The variable `num_list` is a list of integers, created by mapping the second input in stdin to a list of integers. The variable `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, initialized but not populated with any values. Stdin is now empty, as both inputs have been consumed by the code.
