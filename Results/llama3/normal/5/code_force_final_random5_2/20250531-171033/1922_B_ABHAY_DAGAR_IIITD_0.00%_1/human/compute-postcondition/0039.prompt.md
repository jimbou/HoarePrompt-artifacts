Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, results is an empty list, n is an integer, num_list is an empty list, x is not defined, num_of_lens is a dictionary that contains all elements in num_list as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in num_list, res is 0, total_count is 0, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, and `stdin` contains no input. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `total_count` is increased by `cnt` and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, `total_count` is increased by `cnt` and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, no changes are made. Additionally, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is not defined, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all elements in `num_list` as keys and their values are the number of times each element appears in `num_list` and has at least 2 values. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 and the second value in `num_of_lens` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the product of the second value in `num_of_lens`, the second value in `num_of_lens` minus 1, and the second value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6. Otherwise, `res` remains the same. `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
