Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key with its value incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1, meaning that the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
