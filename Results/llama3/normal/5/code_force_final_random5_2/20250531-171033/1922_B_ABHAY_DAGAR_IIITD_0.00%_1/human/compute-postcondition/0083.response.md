To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `num_list`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop executes. Since `results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, and `stdin` contains no inputs, these states do not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains no inputs, `x` is the first integer in `num_list`**
