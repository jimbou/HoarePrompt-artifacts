Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key with a value of 1.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is reset to 1, regardless of its previous value. This means that if `x` was already in `num_of_lens` with a value greater than 1, its value is now set to 1. If `x` was not in `num_of_lens` before, it is now added with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
