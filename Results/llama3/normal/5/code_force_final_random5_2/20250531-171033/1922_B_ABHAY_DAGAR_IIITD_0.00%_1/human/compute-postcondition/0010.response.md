Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element already exists in `num_of_lens`, otherwise the first element is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The `test_cases` still contains at least one sublist of integers, `results` is still an empty list, `n` is still an integer, `num_list` still contains at least two integers, `x` is still the second element in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` still contains the value of the first element in `num_list` as a key with its value increased by 1 if it already exists, or added with a value of 1 if it doesn't. The `stdin` still contains no input.
