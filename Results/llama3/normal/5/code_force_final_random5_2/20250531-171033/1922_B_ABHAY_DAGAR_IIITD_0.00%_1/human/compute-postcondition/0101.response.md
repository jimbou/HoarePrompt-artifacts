Output State: **`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains all integers in `num_list` as keys and has at least one value, `res` is equal to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is 0, and `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 3.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be equal to the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2`, divided by 6. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is still greater than or equal to 3, and `num_of_lens` still contains all integers in `num_list` as keys with at least one value.
