Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists, `results` is a list containing the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the value of `x` is either increased by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is `cnt`, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is 0, `cnt` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt`.**

In this output state, the value of `total_count` has been updated to be equal to `cnt`, which is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`. The value of `res` has also been updated based on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 1 and the sum of the products of each value in `num_of_lens` minus 2 divided by 6 plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * cnt`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
