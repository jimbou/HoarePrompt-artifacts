Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: results has a new element res appended to it, test_cases is greater than 1, n is an integer, num_list is a list of integers, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, stdin contains no inputs
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `stdin` contains no inputs, and `x` is the first integer in `num_list`. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key, if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`results` has a new element `res` appended to it, `test_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains `x` as a key. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
