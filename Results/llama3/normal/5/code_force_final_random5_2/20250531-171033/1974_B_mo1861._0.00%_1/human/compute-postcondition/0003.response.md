To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):`

The current state is:
- `b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters
- `i` is 0
- `c` is the first character in the sorted set of `b`
- `char_map` is a dictionary with `c` as a key and a character as its value, where the character is the (len(b) - i - 1)th letter in the alphabet after 'a'

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
- `c` will be the next character in the sorted set of `b`. Since `c` is currently the first character, the next character will be the second character in the sorted set of `b`.
- `char_map` will still have `c` as a key, but the value will be the (len(b) - i - 1)th letter in the alphabet after 'a', where `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with `c` as a key and a character as its value, where the character is the (len(b) - 1 - 1)th letter in the alphabet after 'a'**
