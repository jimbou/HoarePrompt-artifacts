Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The `func_1` function takes the encoded string `b` as input and creates a character map `char_map` that maps each unique character in `b` to its corresponding character in the original string `s`. The mapping is done by sorting the unique characters in `b` and assigning them to the corresponding characters in the alphabet, starting from the end.

2. The function then iterates over each character `c` in the encoded string `b` and appends the corresponding character from the `char_map` to the decoded string `s`.

3. The function returns the decoded string `s`.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters
* Strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order
* Strings with a length of 1
* Strings with a length greater than 1

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the input string `b` is empty, as the `func_1` function will return an empty string in this case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
