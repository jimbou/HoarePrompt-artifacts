The value of `char_map[c]` is updated to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Since `i` is 1, the expression `len(b) - i - 1` is equal to `len(b) - 2`. The `ord` function returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97. Therefore, `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2))` is the (len(b) - 2)th letter in the alphabet after 'a'. The value of `c` is the second character in the sorted set of `b`, which is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with `c` as a key and the (len(b) - 2)th letter in the alphabet after 'a' as its value.**
