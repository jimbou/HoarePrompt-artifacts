Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is the number of unique characters in `b` minus 1, `c` is the last character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with all unique characters in `b` as keys and their corresponding values are the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in `b`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the string `b` remaining unchanged, the loop counter `i` will be one less than the number of unique characters in `b`, the character `c` will be the last character in the sorted set of unique characters in `b`, and the dictionary `char_map` will contain all unique characters in `b` as keys, with their corresponding values being the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in `b`.
