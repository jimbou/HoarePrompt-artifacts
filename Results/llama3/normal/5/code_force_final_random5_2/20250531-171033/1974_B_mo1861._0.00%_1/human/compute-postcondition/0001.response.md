According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `b`, `i`, and `c`. If `b` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and char_map is an empty dictionary does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `b` is not empty and `i` is 0 and `c` is the first character in the sorted set of `b`. 
State: **`b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `c` is the first character in the sorted set of `b`, char_map is an empty dictionary**
