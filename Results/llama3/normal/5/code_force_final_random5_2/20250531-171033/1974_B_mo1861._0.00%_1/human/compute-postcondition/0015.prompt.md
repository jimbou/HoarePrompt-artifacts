Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is the number of unique characters in `b` minus 1, `c` is the last character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with all unique characters in `b` as keys and their corresponding values are the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in `b`, `s` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for c in b:
    s += char_map[c]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is the number of unique characters in `b` minus 1, `c` is the first character in `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with all unique characters in `b` as keys and their corresponding values are the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in `b`, `s` is a string consisting of the character in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of `c` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with at least one more character, `i` is the number of unique characters in `b` minus 1, `c` is the next character in `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with all unique characters in `b` as keys and their corresponding values are the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in `b`, `s` is a string consisting of the character in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of `c` in `b` and the character in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of `c` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with at least one more character, `i` is the number of unique characters in `b` minus 1, `c` is the next character in `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with all unique characters in `b` as keys and their corresponding values are the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in `b`, `s` is a string consisting of the character in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of `c` in `b` and the character in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of `c` in `b`, and the character in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of `c` in `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
