Output State: **`b` is an empty string, `i` is the number of unique characters in the initial string `b` minus 1, `c` is the last character in the sorted set of the initial string `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with all unique characters in the initial string `b` as keys and their corresponding values are the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in the initial string `b`, `s` is a string consisting of the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of each character in the initial string `b`, in the order they appear in the initial string `b`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the string `b` becomes empty, `i` remains the same as the number of unique characters in the initial string `b` minus 1, `c` becomes the last character in the sorted set of the initial string `b`, `char_map` remains unchanged as a dictionary with all unique characters in the initial string `b` as keys and their corresponding values are the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in the initial string `b`, and `s` becomes a string consisting of the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of each character in the initial string `b`, in the order they appear in the initial string `b`.
