Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, `c` is the third character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with `c` as a key and the (len(b) - i - 1)th letter in the alphabet after 'a' as its value**

In this output state, the value of `char_map[c]` has been updated to the (len(b) - i - 1)th letter in the alphabet after 'a'. The values of `b`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged. The dictionary `char_map` now maps the character `c` to a new value, which is determined by the length of the string `b` and the value of `i`.
