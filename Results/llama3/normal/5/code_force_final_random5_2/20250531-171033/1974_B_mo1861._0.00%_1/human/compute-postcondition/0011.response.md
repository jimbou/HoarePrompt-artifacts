To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for c in b:`. This means we can only adjust the states of `c` and `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is the number of unique characters in `b` minus 1, `c` is the first character in `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with all unique characters in `b` as keys and their corresponding values are the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in `b`, and `s` is a string consisting of the character in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of `c` in `b`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have at least one more character. Since `c` is the first character in `b`, we need to move to the next character in `b`. Let's assume the next character in `b` is `d`.

We can adjust the states as follows:

* `b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with at least one more character.
* `c` is the next character in `b`, which is `d`.
* `i` remains the same, as it is not directly related to the loop head.
* `char_map` remains the same, as it is not directly related to the loop head.
* `s` remains the same, as it is not directly related to the loop head.

State: **`b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with at least one more character, `i` is the number of unique characters in `b` minus 1, `c` is the next character in `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with all unique characters in `b` as keys and their corresponding values are the characters in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of their frequency in `b`, `s` is a string consisting of the character in the alphabet after 'a' in reverse order of the frequency of `c` in `b`.**
