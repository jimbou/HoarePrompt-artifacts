To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):`

The objects in the loop head are:

* `i`
* `c`
* `b` (indirectly, through the `sorted(set(b))` expression)

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more characters in the sorted set of `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character in the sorted set of `b`, and `b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:

* `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` is 2.
* `c` should be the next character in the sorted set of `b`. Since `c` is currently the second character, the next character should be the third character in the sorted set of `b`.
* `b` remains a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, but its contents are not changed.

The state of `char_map` is not directly affected by the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`b` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, `c` is the third character in the sorted set of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with `c` as a key and the (len(b) - 2)th letter in the alphabet after 'a' as its value**
