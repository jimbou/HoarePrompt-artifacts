Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element, `M` is a dictionary where the value of the key `cur` is increased by 1 (if the first element in `N` is greater than -1), or `M` remains unchanged (if the first element in `N` is -1), and `cur` is equal to the next element in `N` (if the first element in `N` is greater than -1), or `cur` remains -1 (if the first element in `N` is -1)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still at least 1, the value of `_` is still 0, and the value of `S` is still an integer. The list `N` still contains at least one more element and is sorted. The dictionary `M` has been updated such that the value of the key `cur` has been incremented by 1, but only if the first element in `N` is greater than -1. If the first element in `N` is -1, then `M` remains unchanged. The value of `cur` is still equal to the next element in `N` if the first element in `N` is greater than -1, or it remains -1 if the first element in `N` is -1.
