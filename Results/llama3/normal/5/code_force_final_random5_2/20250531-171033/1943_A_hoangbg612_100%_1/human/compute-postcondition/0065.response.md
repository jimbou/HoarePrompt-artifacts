Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, num is the third integer in the list N, cur is equal to num and M[cur] is 1.**

The code block modifies the values of `cur` and `M[cur]`. The first line assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, making `cur` equal to the third integer in the list `N`. The second line assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`, indicating that the integer `cur` (which is equal to `num`) has a count of consecutive occurrences equal to 1 in the dictionary `M`. All other variables remain unchanged.
