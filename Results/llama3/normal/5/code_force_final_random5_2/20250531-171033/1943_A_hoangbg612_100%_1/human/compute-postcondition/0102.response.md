Postcondition: ***T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, cnt is a list, stdin is empty, M and cur remain as previously determined based on the comparison of the first integer num in N and cur, and num is the next integer in the list N. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is incremented by 1.***
