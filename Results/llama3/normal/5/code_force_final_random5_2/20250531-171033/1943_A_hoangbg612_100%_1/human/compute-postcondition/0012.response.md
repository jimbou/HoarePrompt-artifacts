To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for num in N:`, where `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers. The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:

* `T` is at least 1
* `_` is 0
* `S` is an integer
* `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers
* If the first element in `N` is greater than -1, then `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in `N` and the value is 1, and `cur` is equal to the first element in `N`. Otherwise, `M` is a dictionary with `M[-1]` is 1, and `cur` remains -1.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. `N` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.
2. The next element in `N` will be assigned to `num` in the loop head.

Since `N` is a sorted list, the next element in `N` will be greater than or equal to the current first element in `N`. If the first element in `N` is greater than -1, then `M` will have a new key-value pair with the next element in `N` as the key and 1 as the value. If the first element in `N` is -1, then `M` will remain unchanged.

The state of `T`, `_`, and `S` does not depend on the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element, `M` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is the next element in `N` and the value is 1 (if the first element in `N` is greater than -1), or `M` remains unchanged (if the first element in `N` is -1), and `cur` is equal to the next element in `N` (if the first element in `N` is greater than -1), or `cur` remains -1 (if the first element in `N` is -1)**
