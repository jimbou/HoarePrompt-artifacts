This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It processes each test case by sorting the integers, counting their occurrences, and identifying the smallest missing integer. If the sum of the counts equals the original number of integers, it increments the smallest missing integer. If there are at least two integers with a count of 1, it updates the smallest missing integer to the second such integer. Finally, it prints the smallest missing integer for each test case.
