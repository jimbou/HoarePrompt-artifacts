Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, and cur is the last integer in the original list N plus one. The current value of the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of T is still at least 2, the value of _ is still 1, the value of S is still an integer, the list N is still empty, the dictionary M is still the same, the list cnt is still the same, but the value of cur has been incremented by 1. The sum of all values in dictionary M is still equal to S.
