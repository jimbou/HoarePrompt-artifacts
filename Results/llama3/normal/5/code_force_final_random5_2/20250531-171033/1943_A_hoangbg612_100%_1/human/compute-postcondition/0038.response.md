Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`, `cur` is either the last integer in the original list `N` or -1 if the list was empty plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise there is no change. If the value of `k` in `M` is 1, `k` is appended to `cnt`.***
