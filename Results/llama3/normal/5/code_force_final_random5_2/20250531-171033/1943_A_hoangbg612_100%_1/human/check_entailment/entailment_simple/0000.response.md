Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array of integers. The program iterates through each test case, sorts the input array, and then iterates through the sorted array to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array (MEX).

The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each integer in the array. It then checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals the size of the input array `S`. If it does, it increments the current MEX `cur` by 1.

The program also creates a list `cnt` to store the keys in `M` with a value of 1. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.

The program then prints the final value of `cur`, which represents the final score of the game.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array and updates the MEX based on the counts of the integers in the array.

Correctness: **True**
