Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer from stdin, N is a sorted list of integers from stdin, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, and cur is -1.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1. If the first integer in the list N is greater than the current integer, then the current integer is updated to the first integer in the list N and the count of consecutive occurrences of the current integer is 1. Otherwise, the count of consecutive occurrences of -1 is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, num is the second integer in the list N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num. Otherwise, the value of M[cur] is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, num is the third integer in the list N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
