Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `cur` is either the second element of `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is at least 2, or it is either the last integer in the original list `N` or -1 if the list was empty, plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise there is no change.

Since `N` is an empty list, the last integer in the original list `N` is not applicable. Therefore, `cur` will be either the second element of `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is at least 2, or -1 plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise there is no change.

* `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1. Since `M` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, and `N` is an empty list, `M` is also empty. Therefore, `cnt` is also an empty list.

Since `cnt` is an empty list, the length of `cnt` is less than 2, and `cur` will not be the second element of `cnt`.

* `M` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer. Since `N` is an empty list, `M` is also empty.

The sum of the values in dictionary `M` is 0, since `M` is empty.

* `S` is an integer.

Since the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals 0, and `S` is an integer, the condition "the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`" is only true if `S` is 0.

If `S` is 0, then `cur` will be -1 plus 1, which is 0.

If `S` is not 0, then `cur` will be -1, since there is no change.

Output: **0 (if S is 0), otherwise -1**
