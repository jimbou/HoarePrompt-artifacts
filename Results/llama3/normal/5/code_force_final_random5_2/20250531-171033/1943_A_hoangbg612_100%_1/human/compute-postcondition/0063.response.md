Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, num is the third integer in the list N, cur is incremented by 1**

The code snippet increments the value of `cur` by 1, but does not affect any other variables. The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code, it does not have any effect. The values of `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `cnt`, and `num` remain unchanged.
