To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. 

Since `N` is a sorted list of integers, we can assume that it is not empty. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `N` to be a non-empty sorted list of integers. Additionally, we can adjust the state of `num` to be the first element in the list `N`.

The other variables `T`, `_`, `S`, `cur`, and `M` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `N`**
