Output State: **T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, cnt is a list, stdin is empty, num is the next integer in the list N, cur is incremented by 1**

The code block consists of two lines: `cur += 1` and `break`. The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop it is in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state.

All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them. The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but its original value is not specified, so we can only state that it has been incremented. The rest of the variables (`T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, `cnt`, `stdin`, and `num`) retain their initial values and properties as described in the initial state.
