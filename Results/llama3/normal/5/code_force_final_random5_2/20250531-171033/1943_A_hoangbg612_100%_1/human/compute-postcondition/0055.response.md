Postcondition: ***T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1. If the first integer in the list N is greater than the current integer, then the current integer is updated to the first integer in the list N and the count of consecutive occurrences of the current integer is 1. Otherwise, the count of consecutive occurrences of -1 is increased by 1.***
