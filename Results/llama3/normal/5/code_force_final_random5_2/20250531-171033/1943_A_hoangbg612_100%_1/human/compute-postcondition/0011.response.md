Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a non-empty sorted list of integers, if the first element in N is greater than -1, then M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in N and the value is 1, and cur is equal to the first element in N. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with M[-1] is 1, and cur remains -1.***
