Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, and cur is the last integer in the original list N or -1 if the list was empty plus 1. The sum of the values in dictionary M equals S.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still at least 1, _ is still 0, S is still an integer, N is still an empty list, M is still a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, and cur is now the last integer in the original list N or -1 if the list was empty plus 1. The sum of the values in dictionary M is still equal to S.
