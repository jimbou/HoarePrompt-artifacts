Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, cur is the first integer in the list N, and M[cur] is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `num` (the first integer in the list `N`) to `cur`. Since `num` is greater than `cur + 1` (as per the initial state), `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. The second line updates the value of `M[cur]` to 1, indicating that the integer `cur` (which is now equal to `num`) has a count of consecutive occurrences equal to 1 in the list `N`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
