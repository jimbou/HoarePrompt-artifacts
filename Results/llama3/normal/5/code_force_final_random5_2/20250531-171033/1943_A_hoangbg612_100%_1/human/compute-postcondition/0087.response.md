Based on the precondition, the code prints the value of `cur`, which is the second element of the list `cnt`. The list `cnt` contains all keys in dictionary `M` where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1. Since `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is the second element of `cnt`.

Output: **the second element of the list cnt (which is a key in dictionary M with a count of consecutive occurrences equal to 1)**
