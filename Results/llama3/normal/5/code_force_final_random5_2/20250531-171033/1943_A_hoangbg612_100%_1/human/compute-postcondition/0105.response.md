Postcondition: ***T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, cnt is a list, stdin is empty. If the next integer num in the list N is greater than cur, then M[cur] is 1 and cur is equal to num. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1, and M and cur remain as previously determined based on the comparison of the first integer num in N and cur.***
