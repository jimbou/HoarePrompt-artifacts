Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, cur is 0, and num is the first integer in the list N and is greater than cur.**

The code snippet increments the value of `cur` by 1, making it 0. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
