Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element, M is a dictionary with the key cur and value 1, num is the next element in N, cur is equal to num.**

In this final state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`, which is the next element in the sorted list `N`. The dictionary `M` now contains a new key-value pair where the key is `cur` (which is equal to `num`) and the value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
