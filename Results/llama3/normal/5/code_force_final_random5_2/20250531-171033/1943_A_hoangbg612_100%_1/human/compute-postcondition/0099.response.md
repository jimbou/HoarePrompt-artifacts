Postcondition: ***T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, cnt is a list, stdin is empty. If the first integer num in the list N is greater than cur, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer num in the list N and the value is 1, and cur is equal to the first integer num in the list N. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with key -1 and value at least 1, and cur remains -1.***
