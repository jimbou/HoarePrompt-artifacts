Postcondition: ***T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, num is the third integer in the list N. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is incremented by 1.***
