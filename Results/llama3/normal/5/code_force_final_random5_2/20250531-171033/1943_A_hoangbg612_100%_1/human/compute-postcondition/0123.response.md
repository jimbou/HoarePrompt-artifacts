Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys, `stdin` is empty, `cur` is -1, `k` is the next key in `M` that hasn't been processed yet. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` is a list containing the first key in `M` with a value of 1 and the next key in `M` that hasn't been processed yet. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
