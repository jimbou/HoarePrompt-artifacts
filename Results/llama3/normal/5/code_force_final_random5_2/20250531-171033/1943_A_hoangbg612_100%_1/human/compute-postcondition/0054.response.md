Output State: **`T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer from stdin, `N` is a sorted list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1, `cur` is -1, `num` is the first integer in the list `N`, `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, and `M[-1]` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `M[-1]` has been increased by 1, but the values of the other variables remain the same. The dictionary `M` still contains the same keys, but the value associated with the key `-1` has been incremented. The list `cnt` still contains the same keys from dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1, but the value of `M[-1]` is now greater than 1, so `-1` is no longer in the list `cnt`.
