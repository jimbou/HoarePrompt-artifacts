State: **`T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1, and `cur` is either the second element of `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is at least 2, otherwise it is either the last integer in the original list `N` or -1 if the list was empty plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise there is no change, and the value of `cur` is being printed**
