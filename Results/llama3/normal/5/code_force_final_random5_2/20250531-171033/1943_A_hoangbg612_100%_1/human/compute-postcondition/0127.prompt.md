Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where keys are integers from the original list N and values are their respective counts, cnt is an empty list, stdin is empty, and cur is either the last integer in the original list N or -1 if the list N was empty. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with at least one key, stdin is empty, and cur is -1. If the value of the first key in M is 1, then cnt is a list containing the first key in M with a value of 1, and k is the first key in M with a value of 1. Otherwise, the state of cnt and k remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys, `stdin` is empty, `cur` is -1, `k` is the next key in `M` that hasn't been processed yet. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` is a list containing the first key in `M` with a value of 1 and the next key in `M` that hasn't been processed yet. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys, `stdin` is empty, `cur` is -1. If `M[k]` is 1, then `N` is a list containing the next key in `M` that hasn't been processed yet and `k` is the next key in `M` that hasn't been processed yet. Otherwise, `N` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
