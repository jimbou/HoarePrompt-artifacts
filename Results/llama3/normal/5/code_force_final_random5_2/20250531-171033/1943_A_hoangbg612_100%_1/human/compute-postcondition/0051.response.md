Postcondition: ***T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1. If num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is set to 0. Otherwise, cur remains -1. num is the first integer in the list N and is greater than cur.***
