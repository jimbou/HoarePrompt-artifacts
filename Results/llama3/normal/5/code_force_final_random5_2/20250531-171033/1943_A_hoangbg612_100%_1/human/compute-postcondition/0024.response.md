Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, and cur is the last integer in the original list N or -1 if the list was empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* T remains at least 1, _ remains 0, and S remains an integer, as these variables are not affected by the loop.
* N becomes an empty list, as the loop iterates over all elements in N.
* M becomes a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N, and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer. This is because the loop increments the count of consecutive occurrences of each integer in M.
* cur is updated to the last integer in the original list N, or remains -1 if the list was empty. This is because the loop updates cur to the current integer being processed, and the last integer in the list is the last one processed.
