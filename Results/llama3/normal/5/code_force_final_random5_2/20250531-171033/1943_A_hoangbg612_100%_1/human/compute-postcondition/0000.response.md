Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. The values of n and a_i are still within their respective ranges.
