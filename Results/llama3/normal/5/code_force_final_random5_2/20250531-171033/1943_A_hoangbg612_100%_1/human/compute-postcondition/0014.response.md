Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one less element, `M` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is the next element in `N` and the value is 1 (if the first element in `N` was greater than -1), or `M` remains unchanged (if the first element in `N` was -1), and `cur` is equal to the next element in `N` plus 1 (if the first element in `N` was greater than -1 and `num` > `cur` + 1), or `cur` remains 0 (if the first element in `N` was -1 or `num` <= `cur` + 1).***
