Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique integer from the original list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`, `cur` is either the last integer in the original list `N` or -1 if the list was empty plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise there is no change, and `k` is one of the keys in `M` with a value of 1.**

In this output state, the code has appended the key `k` to the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cur` is still dependent on the sum of the values in dictionary `M` and the value of `S`. The dictionary `M` still contains at least one key-value pair, and the list `N` is still empty. The variables `T` and `_` retain their initial values.
