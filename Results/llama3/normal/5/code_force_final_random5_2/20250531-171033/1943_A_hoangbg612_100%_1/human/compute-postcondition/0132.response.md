Output: **T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where keys are integers from the original list N and values are their respective counts, cnt is a list containing all keys in M with a value of 1, stdin is empty. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is 0. If the length of cnt is at least 2, then cur is the second element in the list cnt. Otherwise, no changes are made to cur, and cur is printed**
