According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. So, we need to adjust the state of `T` to be at least 1 and `_` is 0 (since it's the first iteration).
State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0**
