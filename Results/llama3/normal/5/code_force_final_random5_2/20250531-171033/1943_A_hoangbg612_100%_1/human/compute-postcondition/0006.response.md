Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a non-empty sorted list of integers, cur is 0, M is an empty dictionary, num is the first element in N, the current value of num is greater than the current value of cur, and the current value of num is greater than cur + 1**

The code increments the value of `cur` by 1, making it 0. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
