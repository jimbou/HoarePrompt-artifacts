Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from the original list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`, `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`, `cur` is either the last integer in the original list `N` or -1 if the list was empty plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise there is no change.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still at least 1, the value of `_` is still 0, the value of `S` is still an integer, the list `N` is still empty, the dictionary `M` still has at least two key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from the original list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer. The list `cnt` now contains the key `k`, which is the second key in the dictionary `M`. The value of `cur` is either the last integer in the original list `N` or -1 if the list was empty plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise there is no change.
