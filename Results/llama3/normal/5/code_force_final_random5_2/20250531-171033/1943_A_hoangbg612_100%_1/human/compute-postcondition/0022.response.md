Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element, `M` is a dictionary where `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `N`**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `M` now contains an updated count for the key `cur`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial properties: `T` is still at least 1, `_` is still 0, `S` is still an integer, `N` is still a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element, and `num` is still the next element in `N`.
