Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, and cur is either the second element of cnt if the length of cnt is at least 2, otherwise it is either the last integer in the original list N or -1 if the list was empty plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise there is no change, and the value of cur is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a list containing all keys in dictionary M where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys in dictionary M where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1, and if cnt has at least 2 elements, cur is the second element of cnt, and the value of cur is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where keys are integers from the original list N and values are their respective counts, cnt is a list containing all keys in M with a value of 1, stdin is empty. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is 0. If the length of cnt is at least 2, then cur is the second element in the list cnt. Otherwise, no changes are made to cur, and cur is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
