The only variable in the loop head is `num` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one less element. So for the loop to be executed one more time `N` must have at least one more element and `num` is the next element in `N`.
State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`**
