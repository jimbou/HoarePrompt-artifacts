Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, num is the second integer in the list N, cur is incremented by 1**

The code block consists of two lines: `cur += 1` and `break`. The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the increment of `cur` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
