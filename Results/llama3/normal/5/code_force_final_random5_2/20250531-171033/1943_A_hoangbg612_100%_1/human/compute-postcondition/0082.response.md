Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`. If the count of consecutive occurrences of `k` in `M` is 1, then `N` is a list containing `k`. Otherwise, `N` remains an empty list.***
