Output State: **`T` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `cnt` is a list, `M[cur]` is increased by 1, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`, `stdin` is empty, and `M` and `cur` remain as previously determined based on the comparison of the first integer `num` in `N` and `cur`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `M` at index `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with `T` still being at least 3, `_` still being 2, `S` still being an integer, `N` still being a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `cnt` still being a list, `num` being the next integer in the list `N`, and `stdin` still being empty. The values of `M` and `cur` are still determined based on the comparison of the first integer `num` in `N` and `cur`.
