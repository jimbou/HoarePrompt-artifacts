According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer from stdin, `N` is a sorted list of integers from stdin, `M` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1, and `cur` is -1. So for the loop to be executed  the list `N` must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **`T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer from stdin, `N` is a sorted list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1, `cur` is -1, `num` is the first integer in the list `N`**
