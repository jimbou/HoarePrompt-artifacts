Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is an empty list. If the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus one. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique integer and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `k` is the first key in the dictionary `M`. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` is a list containing the first key `k` in the dictionary `M`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` is a list containing the first two keys in the dictionary `M` and `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`. If the count of consecutive occurrences of `k` in `M` is 1, then `N` is a list containing `k`. Otherwise, `N` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
