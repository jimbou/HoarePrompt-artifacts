Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, num is the second integer in the list N, and the value of M[cur] is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1, which means the count of consecutive occurrences of the integer cur in the list N has increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
