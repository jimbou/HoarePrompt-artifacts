Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game's optimal strategy. The issue lies in the way it handles the case when there are multiple elements with the same value in the array `N`. The program uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number, but it does not correctly update the `cur` variable when it encounters a number that is greater than `cur + 1`.

For example, consider the input `N = [0, 0, 2, 2]`. The program will sort the array to get `N = [0, 0, 2, 2]`. It will then iterate through the array, incrementing `cur` when it encounters a number that is greater than `cur`. However, when it encounters the second `2`, it will not increment `cur` because `2` is not greater than `cur + 1`. As a result, `cur` will remain at `1`, and the program will output `1` as the final score. However, the correct final score should be `3`, because Alice can choose the two `2`s and Bob can choose the two `0`s, leaving `3` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game's optimal strategy, and its output may not always match the expected output.
