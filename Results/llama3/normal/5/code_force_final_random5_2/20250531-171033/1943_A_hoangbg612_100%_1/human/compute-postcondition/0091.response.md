To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. So for the loop to be executed, the list `N` must have at least 1 integer and `num` is the first integer in the list.

State: **`T` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is a list, `cur` is -1, `stdin` is empty, `num` is the first integer in the list**
