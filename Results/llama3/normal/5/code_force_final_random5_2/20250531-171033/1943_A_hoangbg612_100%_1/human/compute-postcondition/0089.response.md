According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `T` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 2.
State: **`T` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a list containing all keys in dictionary `M` where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1, `M` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys in dictionary `M` where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1, and if `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is the second element of `cnt`, and the value of `cur` is printed**
