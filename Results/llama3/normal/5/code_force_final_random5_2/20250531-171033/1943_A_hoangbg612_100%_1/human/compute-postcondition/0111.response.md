Postcondition: ***T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, cnt is a list, stdin is empty. If the next integer in the list N is greater than the current integer, then the current integer is updated to the next integer in the list N and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1.***
