Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a list containing all keys in dictionary M where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys in dictionary M where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `N` will contain all keys from the dictionary `M` where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1. The list `cnt` will also contain all keys from the dictionary `M` where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
