Output State: **T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, cnt is a list, stdin is empty, num is the next integer in the list N, M[cur] is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of M[cur] has been incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list N still contains at least 2 integers and is sorted. The variable num still represents the next integer in the list N. The stdin remains empty.
