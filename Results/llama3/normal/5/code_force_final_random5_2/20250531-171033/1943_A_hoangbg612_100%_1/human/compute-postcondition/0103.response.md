Output State: **T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, cnt is a list, stdin is empty, M[cur] is 1, cur is equal to the next integer num in the list N.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `cur` and `M[cur]`. The first line assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, making `cur` equal to the next integer in the list `N`. The second line assigns the value `1` to `M[cur]`, effectively setting the value of `M` at the index `cur` to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
