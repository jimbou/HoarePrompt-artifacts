The only variable in the loop head is variable num and list N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N. If the list N has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list N. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list N must have at least 2 integers and num is the second integer in the list N.
State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, num is the second integer in the list N**
