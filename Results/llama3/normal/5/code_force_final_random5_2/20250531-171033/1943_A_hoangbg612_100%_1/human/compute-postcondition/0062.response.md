To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the second integer in the list `N`, and `N` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least 3 integers, and `num` must be the third integer in the list `N`.

State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, num is the third integer in the list N**
