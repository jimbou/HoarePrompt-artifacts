Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one less element, M is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is the value of num and the value is 1, and cur is equal to the value of num.**

The code first assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, updating its value. Then, it adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `M`, where the key is the value of `cur` (which is now equal to `num`) and the value is 1. This means that `M` now has an additional entry with the key being the value of `num` and the value being 1. The other variables, `T`, `_`, `S`, and `N`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
