Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is an empty list, and cur is either the last integer in the original list N or -1 if the list was empty plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, otherwise there is no change.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new empty list `cnt`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the condition for `cur` still depends on the sum of the values in dictionary `M` and the value of `S`.
