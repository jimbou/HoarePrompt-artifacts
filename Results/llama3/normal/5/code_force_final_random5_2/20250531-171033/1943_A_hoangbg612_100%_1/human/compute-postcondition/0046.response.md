Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer from stdin, N is a sorted list of integers from stdin, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, and cur is -1.**

The code snippet provided reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `S`, then reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them, and assigns them to `N`. It then initializes `cur` to -1 and creates an empty dictionary `M`. The final state reflects these changes, with `S` and `N` updated based on the input, and `cur` and `M` initialized as specified. The values of `T` and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
