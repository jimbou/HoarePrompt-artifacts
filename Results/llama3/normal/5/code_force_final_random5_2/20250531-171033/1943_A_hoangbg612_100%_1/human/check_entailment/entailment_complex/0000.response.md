Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers.
2.  It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the smallest missing integer (MEX).
3.  It initializes a dictionary `M` to store the count of each integer in the sorted list.
4.  It iterates through the sorted list, updating the count of each integer in the dictionary `M`. If it encounters an integer greater than the current integer `cur`, it checks if there is a gap between `cur` and the current integer. If there is a gap, it increments `cur` and breaks the loop.
5.  After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in dictionary `M` equals the original number of integers `S`. If it does, it increments `cur` because the smallest missing integer is one more than the maximum integer in the list.
6.  It then creates a list `cnt` containing all keys in `M` with a value of 1. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it updates `cur` to the second element in `cnt` because the second smallest missing integer is the optimal choice for Alice to maximize the score.
7.  Finally, it prints the smallest missing integer `cur` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score, considering the constraints and rules of the game.

Correctness: **True**
