Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1, and cur is the last integer in the original list N.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations means that the loop has processed all integers in the sorted list N. The dictionary M now contains the count of consecutive occurrences of each unique integer in the original list N. The list cnt contains all keys from dictionary M where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1. The variable cur is updated to the last integer in the original list N. The other variables T, _, and S remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
