Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a non-empty sorted list of integers, if the first element in N is greater than -1, then M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in N and the value is 1, and cur is equal to the first element in N. Otherwise, M is a dictionary with M[-1] is 1, and cur remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one less element, and M is a dictionary. If num is greater than cur, a new key-value pair is added to M where the key is the value of num and the value is 1, and cur is updated to the value of num. Otherwise, if the first element in N is greater than -1, the value of the key cur in M is increased by 1, and cur is updated to the next element in N. If the first element in N is -1, M remains unchanged and cur remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one more element, M is a dictionary. If num > cur, then M has the key cur with value 1 and cur is equal to num. Otherwise, M[cur] is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
