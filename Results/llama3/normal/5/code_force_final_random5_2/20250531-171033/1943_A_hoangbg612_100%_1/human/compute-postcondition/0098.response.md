Output State: **`T` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value at least 1, `cnt` is a list, `cur` is -1, `stdin` is empty, `num` is the first integer in the list, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include the key `-1` with a value that is at least 1, since `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `-1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
