Output State: **T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where keys are integers from the original list N and values are their respective counts, cnt is a list containing all keys in M with a value of 1, stdin is empty, and cur is either the last integer in the original list N or -1 if the list N was empty. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `cnt` will contain all keys from the dictionary `M` that have a value of 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, with `T` being at least 3, `_` being 2, `S` being an integer, `N` being an empty list, `M` being a dictionary with keys as integers from the original list `N` and values as their respective counts, `stdin` being empty, and `cur` being either the last integer in the original list `N` or -1 if the list `N` was empty. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is 0; otherwise, no changes are made.
