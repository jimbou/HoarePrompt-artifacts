Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a list containing all keys in dictionary M where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys in dictionary M where the count of consecutive occurrences is 1 and has at least 2 elements, cur is the second element of cnt.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for the new variable `cur`, which is assigned the value of the second element of the list `cnt`. The list `cnt` still contains at least 2 elements, and all other variables maintain their original properties.
