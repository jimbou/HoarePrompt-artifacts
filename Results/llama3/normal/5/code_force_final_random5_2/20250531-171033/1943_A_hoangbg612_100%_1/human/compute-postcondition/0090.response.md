Output State: **T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, M is an empty dictionary, cnt is a list, cur is -1, and stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the final state:

* `T` remains unchanged, still being at least 3.
* `_` remains unchanged, still being 2.
* `S` is now an integer, but its value is unknown since it was read from the input.
* `N` is now a sorted list of integers, which were read from the input.
* `M` is an empty dictionary, as it was initialized as such.
* `cnt` is a list, but its contents are unknown since it was not modified in the code.
* `cur` is now -1, as it was explicitly set to this value.
* Stdin is empty, as two inputs were read from it: an integer for `S` and a list of integers for `N`.
