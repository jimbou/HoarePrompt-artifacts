Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with `M[-1]` is 1, and `num` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is not greater than `cur`**

In this output state, the value of `M[-1]` has been updated to 1, indicating that the key `-1` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `M` now contains the key-value pair `(-1, 1)`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
