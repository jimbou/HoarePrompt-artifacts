Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs where each key is a unique integer from the original list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer. If the value of key `k` in dictionary `M` is 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the key `k` and `k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`. `cur` is either the last integer in the original list `N` or -1 if the list was empty plus 1 if the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, otherwise there is no change.***
