Output State: **T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is an empty list. If the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus one. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of cnt has been changed to an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for cur still holds, but since N is an empty list, cur will not be updated.
