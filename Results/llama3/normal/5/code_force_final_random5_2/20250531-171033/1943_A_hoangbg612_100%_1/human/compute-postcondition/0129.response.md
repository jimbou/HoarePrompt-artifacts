Output State: **T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where keys are integers from the original list N and values are their respective counts, cnt is a list containing all keys in M with a value of 1, stdin is empty, and cur is the second element in the list cnt.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to the second element in the list `cnt`, which is a list containing all keys in dictionary `M` with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `T` still being at least 3, `_` still being 2, `S` still being an integer, `N` still being an empty list, `M` still being a dictionary where keys are integers from the original list `N` and values are their respective counts, and `stdin` still being empty.
