Output State: **`T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where each key is a unique integer and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `cnt` is a list containing the first key `k` in the dictionary `M`, and `k` is the first key in the dictionary `M` with `M[k]` equal to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still at least 2, the value of `_` is still 1, and the value of `S` is still an integer. The list `N` is still empty. The dictionary `M` still has at least one key-value pair, where each key is a unique integer and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer. The list `cnt` now contains the first key `k` in the dictionary `M`. The value of `k` is still the first key in the dictionary `M`, and the value of `M[k]` is still 1.
