Postcondition: **`T` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer from stdin, `N` is a sorted list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1, `cur` is -1, and the current value of `num` is the first integer in the list `N` and is greater than the current value of `cur`.**
