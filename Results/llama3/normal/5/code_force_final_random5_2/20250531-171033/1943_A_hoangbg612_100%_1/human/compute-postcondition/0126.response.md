Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys, `stdin` is empty, `cur` is -1. If `M[k]` is 1, then `N` is a list containing the next key in `M` that hasn't been processed yet and `k` is the next key in `M` that hasn't been processed yet. Otherwise, `N` remains an empty list.***
