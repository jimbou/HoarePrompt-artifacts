Postcondition: ***T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary with at least one key, stdin is empty, and cur is -1. If the value of the first key in M is 1, then cnt is a list containing the first key in M with a value of 1, and k is the first key in M with a value of 1. Otherwise, the state of cnt and k remains unchanged.***
