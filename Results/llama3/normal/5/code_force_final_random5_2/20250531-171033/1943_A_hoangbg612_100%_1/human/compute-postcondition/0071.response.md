Postcondition: ***T is at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the original list N and the value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that integer, cnt is a list containing all keys k from dictionary M where M[k] equals 1. If the sum of all values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus one. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
