Postcondition: ***T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a non-empty sorted list of integers with at least one less element, and M is a dictionary. If num is greater than cur, a new key-value pair is added to M where the key is the value of num and the value is 1, and cur is updated to the value of num. Otherwise, if the first element in N is greater than -1, the value of the key cur in M is increased by 1, and cur is updated to the next element in N. If the first element in N is -1, M remains unchanged and cur remains -1.***
