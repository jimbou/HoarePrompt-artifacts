Output State: **T is at least 3, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, cnt is a list, stdin is empty, M and cur remain as previously determined based on the comparison of the first integer num in N and cur, and num is the next integer in the list N, cur is incremented by 1.**

The code snippet increments the value of `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop. The `break` statement does not affect any variables, but it does terminate the loop. The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but its previous value was determined based on the comparison of the first integer `num` in `N` and `cur`, so its new value is still dependent on that comparison. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
