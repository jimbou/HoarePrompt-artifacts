Output State: **T is at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a non-empty sorted list of integers, M is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in N and the value is 1, num is the first element in N, and cur is equal to the first element in N.**

In this final state, the value of T remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of _ also remains unchanged as it was not used or modified by the code. The value of S remains an integer as it was not modified by the code. The list N remains a non-empty sorted list of integers as it was not modified by the code. The dictionary M now contains one key-value pair where the key is the first element in N (which is the current value of num) and the value is 1. The value of num remains the first element in N as it was not modified by the code. The value of cur is now equal to the first element in N (which is the current value of num) as it was assigned the value of num in the first line of the code.
