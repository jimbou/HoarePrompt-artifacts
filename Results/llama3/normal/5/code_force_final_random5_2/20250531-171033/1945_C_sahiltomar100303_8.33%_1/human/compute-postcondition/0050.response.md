Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s contains at least one '1' character and the second half of s contains at least one '0' character, mid is equal to n // 2, left is greater than 0, leftMove is equal to 0, i is equal to n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '0', then leftZero is one less than the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero and trightZero are one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '1', then leftOne is one less than the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne and trightOne are one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of s.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `left` has been decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
