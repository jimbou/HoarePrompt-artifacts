Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to (`n - left + 1`) // 2, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` and `trightOne` is less than (`n - (`mid + 1`) + 1`) // 2, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 3`, `n` is greater than `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than (`mid + 3`) // 2, `trightOne` is less than (`n - (`mid + 2`) + 1`) // 2. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value and `trightZero` is one less than its original value. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is one more than its original value and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.**

The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `right` being `mid + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their relationships and constraints are still valid.
