Output State: **`n` is an integer and is at least 4, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is greater than 1, `right` is `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `leftZero` is less than `(n + 2) // 4` and either `leftZero` is less than `n // 4` or `rightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 2) // 4` and either `leftZero` is less than `n // 4` or `rightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `left` is `mid - 2` and is greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at index `mid - 2` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value, `rightZero` is one more than its original value, and the character at index `mid - 2` of `s` is '0'. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, `rightOne` is one more than its original value, and the character at index `mid - 2` of `s` is not '0'. If the character at index `left - 1` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than its original value, `rightZero` is one more than its original value, and the character at index `left - 1` of `s` is '0'. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, `rightOne` is one more than its original value, and the character at index `left - 1` of `s` is not '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, with the updated value of `left`.
