Postcondition: ***n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is 1, if s[i] is '0', then leftZero is 2, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus 2, leftOne is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1. If s[i] is not '0', then leftZero is 1, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus 1, leftOne is 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus 1.***
