Postcondition: **The values of leftZero, leftOne, rightZero, rightOne, tleftZero, tleftOne, trightZero, and trightOne are updated based on the value of s[right] and s[right + 1]. If s[right] is '0', the counts of '0' and '1' characters in the first and second halves of s are updated accordingly. If s[right] is not '0', the counts of '0' and '1' characters in the first and second halves of s are updated differently. In both cases, the values of leftMove, i, right, and stdin are unchanged.**
