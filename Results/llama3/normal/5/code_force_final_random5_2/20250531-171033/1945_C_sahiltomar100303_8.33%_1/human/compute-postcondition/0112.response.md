Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and at least 2, leftZero is 2 if the first character of s is '0', otherwise it is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1 if the first character of s is not '0', otherwise it is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 2 if the first character of s is '0', otherwise it is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1 if the first character of s is not '0', otherwise it is 0, trightOne is 0, left is 0 or not 0, right is n or not n, t is greater than 1, i is 1, and stdin contains 1 input: a string.**

In this output state, the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` have been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` depends on the first character of the string `s`. If the first character is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are both 2; otherwise, they are both 1. All other variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
