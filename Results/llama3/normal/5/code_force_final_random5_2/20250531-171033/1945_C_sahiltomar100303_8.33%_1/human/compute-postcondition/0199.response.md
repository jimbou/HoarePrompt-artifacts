Postcondition: ***right is less than n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, and trightOne is 0. left is not equal to 0. The absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right is strictly larger than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left***
