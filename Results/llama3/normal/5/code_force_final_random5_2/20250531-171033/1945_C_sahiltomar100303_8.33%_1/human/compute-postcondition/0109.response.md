Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and at least 1, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0, left is 0 or not 0, right is n or not n, t is greater than 1, i is 0, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. The first character of s is not '0'.**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 0, it becomes 1. Similarly, `tleftOne` also becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
