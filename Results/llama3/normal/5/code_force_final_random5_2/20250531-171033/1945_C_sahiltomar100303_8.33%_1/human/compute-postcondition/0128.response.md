Output State: **n is at least 1, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 1 if s[i] is '0' otherwise it is 0, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1' otherwise it is 1, right is n or not n, t is greater than 1, i is mid + 1, n must be greater than mid + 1, stdin contains 1 input: a string, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is 1 if s[i] is '0' otherwise it is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1' otherwise it is 1, left is 0 or not 0**

The code increments the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` and `trightOne` were 1 if `s[i]` is '1' otherwise they were 0, now they are 1 if `s[i]` is '1' otherwise they are 1. No other variables are affected.
