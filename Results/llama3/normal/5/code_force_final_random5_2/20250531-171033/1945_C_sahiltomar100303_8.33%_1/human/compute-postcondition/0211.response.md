Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and must be greater than 0, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0, right is n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus 1, t must be greater than 1, i is 0, and the character at index i of s is not '0'**

The code increments `leftOne` by 1 and `tleftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 0, it becomes 1. `tleftOne` was initially the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, so it increases by 1. No other variables are affected.
