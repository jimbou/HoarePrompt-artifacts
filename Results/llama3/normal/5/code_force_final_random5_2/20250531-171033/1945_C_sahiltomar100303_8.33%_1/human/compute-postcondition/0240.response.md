Output State: **n is an integer and is at least mid + (n - mid), s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is n - 1, leftZero is less than (n + 2) // 4 and is one less than its original value, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right and is one more than its original value, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right, rightOne is less than (n + 2) // 4, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right, left is mid, leftMove is 0, and s[left - 1] is '0'.**

In this output state, the values of `leftZero` and `rightZero` have been updated according to the code. `leftZero` is now one less than its original value, and `rightZero` is one more than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
