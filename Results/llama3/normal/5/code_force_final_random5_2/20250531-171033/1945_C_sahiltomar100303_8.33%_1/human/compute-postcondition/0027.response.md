Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is equal to mid + 1. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are 2, and rightOne and trightOne are 1. If s[i] is '1', then rightZero and trightZero are 1, and rightOne and trightOne are 2.***
