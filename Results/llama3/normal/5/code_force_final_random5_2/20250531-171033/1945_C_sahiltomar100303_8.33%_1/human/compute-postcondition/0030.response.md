Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is equal to mid + 2, rightZero is equal to 3 if s[i-1] is '0' otherwise 1, trightZero is equal to 3 if s[i-1] is '0' otherwise 1, rightOne is equal to 4 if s[i-1] is '0' otherwise 4, and trightOne is equal to 4 if s[i-1] is '0' otherwise 4.**

The code increments the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1. The initial values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` depend on the value of `s[i-1]`. If `s[i-1]` is '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are initially 1, and after the increment, they become 2. If `s[i-1]` is '1', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are initially 3, and after the increment, they become 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
