Output State: **left is equal to 0, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, leftMove is equal to 0, i is equal to n, right is equal to mid, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftMove`, and `i` are still the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
