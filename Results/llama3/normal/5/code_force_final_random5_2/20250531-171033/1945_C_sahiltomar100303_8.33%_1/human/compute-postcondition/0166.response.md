Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `n` is sufficiently greater than `mid` to allow either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` to be true. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value and `trightZero` is one less than its original value. If `s[right - 1]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is one more than its original value and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `right` being equal to `mid + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `n`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` still hold true.
