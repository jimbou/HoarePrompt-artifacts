The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `mid` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `mid` must be greater than 2.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 2, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is '1', then leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 0. Otherwise, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0.**
