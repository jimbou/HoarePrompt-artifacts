Postcondition: ***n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is 2. If s[i] is '0', then leftZero is either 3 or 2, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus either 3 or 2, leftOne is either 0 or 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus either 0 or 1. If s[i] is not '0', then leftZero is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of s[i], tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus either 1 or 2 depending on the value of s[i], leftOne is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of s[i] plus 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus either 1 or 2 depending on the value of s[i] plus 1.***
