Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, trightZero is 0, trightOne is 0, right is n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, t must be greater than 1, and i is 0.**

The first line increments `leftZero` by 1, making it 1. The second line increments `tleftZero` by 1, adding 1 to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`. No other variables are affected.
