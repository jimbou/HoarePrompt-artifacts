Postcondition: ***`left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `leftMove`, `n`, `mid`, `s[right - 1]`. If `left` is 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to (`n + 1`) // 2, the value of `left` which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed. If `left` is not 0, then if `right` is equal to `n`, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (`n + 1`) // 2, the value of `right` which is `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `left` which is not 0 is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then if the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `right`, the value of `left` is printed. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `right` is less than the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `left`, the value of `right` is printed.***
