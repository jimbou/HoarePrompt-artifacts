Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` and `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`. If the character at index `right` in `s` is '0', then `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` minus 1 and `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus 1. If the character at index `right` in `s` is '1', then `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` minus one and `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and it is now `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the character at index `right` in `s` are still valid, and the values of `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, and `tleftZero` depend on the character at index `right` in `s`.
