Output State: **left is 0, right is mid + 1, n is sufficiently greater than mid to allow either tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2 to be true, tleftOne is one more than its original value, trightOne is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them. The condition that `n` must be sufficiently greater than `mid` to allow either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` to be true also remains valid. The only changes are to `tleftOne` and `trightOne`, which are incremented and decremented by 1, respectively.
