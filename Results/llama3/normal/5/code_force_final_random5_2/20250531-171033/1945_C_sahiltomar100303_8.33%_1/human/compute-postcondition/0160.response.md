Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `right` is `mid`, and `n` is greater than `mid`. If the character at index `right` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `rightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is increased by 1 and `rightOne` is decreased by 1. The number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` is `leftZero`, the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` is `rightZero`, the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` is `leftOne`, and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` is `rightOne`.***
