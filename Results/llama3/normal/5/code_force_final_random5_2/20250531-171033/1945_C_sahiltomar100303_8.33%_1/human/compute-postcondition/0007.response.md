Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is at least 1, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the character at index i of string s is '1'**

The code increments the value of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 0, it becomes 1. Similarly, `tleftOne` was initially 0, so it also becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
