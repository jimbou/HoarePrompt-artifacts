Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 1 if s[i] is '0' and 0 otherwise, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 2 if s[i] is '1' and 1 otherwise, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is 1 if s[i] is '0' and 0 otherwise, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 2 if s[i] is '1' and 1 otherwise, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is equal to mid + 1**

The code increments the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` and `trightOne` were initially 1 if `s[i]` is '1' and 0 otherwise, they now become 2 if `s[i]` is '1' and 1 otherwise. No other variables are affected by the code.
