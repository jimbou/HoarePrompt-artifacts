Output State: **n is at least 1, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is mid, leftMove is 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is n, and stdin contains 1 input: a string.**

The code assigns the value of `mid` to `left`, and assigns 0 to `leftMove`. The values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `right`, `t`, `i`, and the content of stdin remain unchanged.
