Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to n // 4 and is one more than its original value, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - left + 1) // 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index mid, trightZero is one less than its original value, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index mid and is less than (n - (mid + 1) + 1) // 2, leftMove is 0, right is mid + 2, n is greater than mid + 2, tleftZero is less than (mid + 3) // 2, trightOne is less than (n - (mid + 2) + 1) // 2**

The code increments `tleftZero` by 1 and decrements `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes the updated values of `tleftZero` and `trightZero`, while all other variables retain their original values and constraints.
