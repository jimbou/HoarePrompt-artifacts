Output State: **n is at least 3, s is a string that allows for the conditions (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2) to be potentially true in the next iteration, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, tleftZero, trightZero, tleftOne, trightOne are as previously defined but with the understanding that their values must allow for the loop conditions to be met, left is mid - 1, leftMove is 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is n, stdin contains 1 input: a string, leftOne is one less than its original value, rightOne is one more than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code modifies the values of leftOne and rightOne. leftOne is decremented by 1, and rightOne is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The string s still allows for the conditions to be potentially true in the next iteration. The values of mid, tleftZero, trightZero, tleftOne, trightOne, left, leftMove, right, t, and i remain the same. Stdin still contains 1 input: a string.
