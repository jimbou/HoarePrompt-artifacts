Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least 1, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is mid, leftMove is 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is n, and stdin contains 1 input: a string.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is mid - 1, leftMove is 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is n, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index left - 1 in s is '0', then leftZero is one less than the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s. Otherwise, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is one less than the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of s.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is at least 3, `s` is a string that allows for the conditions (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2) to be potentially true in the next iteration, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one less than its previous value, `trightZero` is one more than its previous value, `tleftOne` is unchanged, and `trightOne` is unchanged. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than 4, `s` is a string that allows for the conditions (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2) to be potentially true in the next iteration, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `left` is `mid - 3`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
