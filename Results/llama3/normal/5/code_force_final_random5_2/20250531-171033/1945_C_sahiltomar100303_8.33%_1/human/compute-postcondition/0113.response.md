Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and at least 2, leftZero is 1 if the first character of s is '0', otherwise it is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 2 if the first character of s is not '0', otherwise it is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1 if the first character of s is '0', otherwise it is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 2 if the first character of s is not '0', otherwise it is 1, trightOne is 0, left is 0 or not 0, right is n or not n, t is greater than 1, i is 1, and stdin contains 1 input: a string.**

In this output state, the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` have been incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are now 2; otherwise, they are 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
