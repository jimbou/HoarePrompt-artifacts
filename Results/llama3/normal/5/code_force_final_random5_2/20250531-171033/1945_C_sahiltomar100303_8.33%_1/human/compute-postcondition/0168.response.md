Output State: **left is 0, right is mid + 2, n is sufficiently greater than mid, tleftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2 if s[right - 1] is '0', and trightOne is less than (n - right + 1) // 2 - 1 if s[right - 1] is not '0', trightZero is one less than its original value.**

The code increments `tleftZero` by 1 and decrements `trightZero` by 1. The value of `trightZero` is reduced by 1, while the value of `tleftZero` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
