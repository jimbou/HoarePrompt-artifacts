Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is mid. leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer and is at least `mid + 1`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `right` is `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `mid`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right` plus 1, and `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right` plus 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is one more than its original value, and `trightOne` is one more than its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer and is at least mid + 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is mid + 1, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, rightZero and trightZero are either one more or the same as the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right, rightOne and trightOne are either one more or two more than their original values, depending on whether s[i] is '0' or '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer and is at least `mid + 2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `right` is `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `mid + 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `trightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` are either one more or two more than their original values. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are either one more or the same as the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` are one more than their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
