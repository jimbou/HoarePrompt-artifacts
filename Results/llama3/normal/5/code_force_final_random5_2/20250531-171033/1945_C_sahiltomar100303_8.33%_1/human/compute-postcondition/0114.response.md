Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and at least 2, `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are incremented by 1, otherwise `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are incremented by 1. The values of `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `right`, and `t` remain unchanged.**
