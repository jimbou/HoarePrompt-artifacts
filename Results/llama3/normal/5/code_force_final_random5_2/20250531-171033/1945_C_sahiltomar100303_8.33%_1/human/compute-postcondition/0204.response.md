Postcondition: **`right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, and `trightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, and the total number of '1' characters in the string `s` is greater than or equal to half of the length of `s` plus one, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed. If `left` is not equal to 0, then if `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `right` which is `n` is printed if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus one, divided by 2, otherwise the value of `left` is printed. If `right` is less than `n`, then the value of `left` is printed if the absolute difference between the middle index of the string `s` and the current value of `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle index of the string `s` and the current value of `right`, otherwise the value of `right` which is less than `n` is printed.**
