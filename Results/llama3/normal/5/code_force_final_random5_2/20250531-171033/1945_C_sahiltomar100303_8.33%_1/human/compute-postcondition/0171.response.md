Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 3`, `n` is sufficiently greater than `mid`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` if `s[right - 1]` is '0', and `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2 - 1` if `s[right - 1]` is not '0'. If `s[right]` is '0', `trightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value, and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `right` being `mid + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged, but their relationships and constraints are still valid. The value of `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are still dependent on the value of `s[right - 1]`, and the value of `trightZero` is still dependent on the value of `s[right]`.
