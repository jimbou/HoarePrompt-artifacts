Output State: **left is 0, right is mid + 2, n is sufficiently greater than mid, tleftZero is less than (right + 1) // 2 - 1 if s[right - 1] is '0', tleftOne is one more than its original value, and trightOne is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, `n`, and `tleftZero` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, and the value of `trightOne` is decremented by 1. The relationship between `n` and `mid` also remains the same, as `n` is still sufficiently greater than `mid`.
