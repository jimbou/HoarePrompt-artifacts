Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `s` is a string that allows for the conditions (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2) to be potentially true in the next iteration, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.***
