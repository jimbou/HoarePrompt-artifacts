Postcondition: **The program prints the value of `right` (which is equal to `n`) if the total number of '0' characters in both halves of string `s` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus one and `right` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, if `right` is not equal to `n`, the program prints the value of either `left` or `right` (which is not equal to `n`), depending on which index has a smaller absolute difference with the middle index of `s`.**
