Postcondition: ***`right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, and `trightOne` is 0. The current value of `left` is 0. If the total number of '1' characters in the string `s` is greater than or equal to half of the length of `s` plus one, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed.***
