Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is at least 2, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0.**

The code increments the values of `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` and `tleftOne` were initially 0, they both become 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
