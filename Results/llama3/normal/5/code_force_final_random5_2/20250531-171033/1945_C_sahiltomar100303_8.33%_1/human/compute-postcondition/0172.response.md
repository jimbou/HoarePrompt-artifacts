Output State: **right is n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, and trightOne is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `right` pointer has reached the end of the string `s` (i.e., `right` is equal to `n`). The number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1` is stored in `tleftZero`, and the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1` is stored in `tleftOne`. The number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` from index `right` to the end is stored in `trightZero`, and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` from index `right` to the end is stored in `trightOne`.
