Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, right is n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, and t must be greater than 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid):
    if s[i] == '0':
        leftZero += 1
        tleftZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne += 1
        tleftOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `right` is `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1` plus 1, and `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, and `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is 1, if s[i] is '0', then leftZero is 2, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus 2, leftOne is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1. If s[i] is not '0', then leftZero is 1, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus 1, leftOne is 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is 2. If s[i] is '0', then leftZero is either 3 or 2, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus either 3 or 2, leftOne is either 0 or 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus either 0 or 1. If s[i] is not '0', then leftZero is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of s[i], tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus either 1 or 2 depending on the value of s[i], leftOne is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of s[i] plus 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1 plus either 1 or 2 depending on the value of s[i] plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
