To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3⋅10^5) followed by a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `_` is 0**
