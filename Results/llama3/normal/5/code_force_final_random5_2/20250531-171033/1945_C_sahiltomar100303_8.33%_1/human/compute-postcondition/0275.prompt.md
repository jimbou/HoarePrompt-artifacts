Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` and `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`. If the character at index `right` in `s` is '0', then `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` minus 1 and `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus 1. If the character at index `right` in `s` is '1', then `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` minus one and `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus one.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to (`n - left + 1`) // 2, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` and `trightOne` is less than (`n - (`mid + 1`) + 1`) // 2, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `n` is greater than `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` is less than (`mid + 2`) // 2. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are 1 more than their original values and `trightZero` is 1 less than its original value. If `s[right - 1]` is '1', then `leftOne` is 1 more than its original value and `trightOne` is 1 less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to (`n - left + 1`) // 2, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` and `trightOne` is less than (`n - (`mid + 1`) + 1`) // 2, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid + 3`, `n` is greater than `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than (`mid + 3`) // 2, `trightOne` is less than (`n - (`mid + 2`) + 1`) // 2. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is one more than its original value and `trightZero` is one less than its original value. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `leftOne` is one more than its original value and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
