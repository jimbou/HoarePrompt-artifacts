Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is at least 2, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 2, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is '1', then leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 0.**

The code increments `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` become 2. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', then `leftZero` becomes 1 and `tleftZero` becomes 1, but `tleftOne` becomes 2. No other variables are affected.
