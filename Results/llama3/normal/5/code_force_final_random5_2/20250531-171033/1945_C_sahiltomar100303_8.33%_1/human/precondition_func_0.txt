stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.
