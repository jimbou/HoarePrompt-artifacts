Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is mid. leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `mid`, which is the middle index of the string `s`. The values of `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be equal to the number of '0' and '1' characters in the first half of `s`, respectively. The values of `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` will be equal to the number of '0' and '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' and '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, respectively. The values of `n`, `s`, `mid`, `right`, and `t` remain unchanged.
