Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 3 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', then `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 0.**
