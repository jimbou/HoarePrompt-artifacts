The code prints the value of the variable `right`, which is equal to `n`. Since `n` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, we can't provide a specific numerical value for `right`. However, based on the given information, we can describe the value of `right` as being equal to `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the value of the variable n)**
