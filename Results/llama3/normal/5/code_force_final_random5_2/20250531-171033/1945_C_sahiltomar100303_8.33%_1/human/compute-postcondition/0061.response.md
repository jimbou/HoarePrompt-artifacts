The code increments `tleftZero` by 1 and decrements `trightZero` by 1. The value of `tleftZero` is now equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus two if `s[right + 1]` is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus one. The value of `trightZero` is now equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` minus one if `s[right + 1]` is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` minus two. All other variables remain unchanged.
