The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid`, `n` is greater than `mid`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `mid + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' otherwise it is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1' otherwise it is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' otherwise it is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1' otherwise it is 0, `left` is 0 or not 0, `right` is `n` or not `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, and `stdin` contains 1 input: a string.**
