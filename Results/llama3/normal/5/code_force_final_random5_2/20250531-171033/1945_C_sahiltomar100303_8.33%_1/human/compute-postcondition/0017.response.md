Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 0, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is equal to mid.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` will be equal to the number of '0' and '1' characters in the first half of the string `s`, respectively. The variables `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` will remain 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `mid`, which is the middle index of the string `s`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `s`, and `mid` will remain unchanged.
