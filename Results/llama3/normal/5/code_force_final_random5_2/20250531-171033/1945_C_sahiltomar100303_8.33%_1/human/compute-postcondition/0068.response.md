Postcondition: **The value of `right` is increased by 1, while the values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftMove`, `i`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, and `n` is greater than the new value of `right`. If `s[right]` is '0', then the value of `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and the value of `trightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then the value of `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and the value of `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**
