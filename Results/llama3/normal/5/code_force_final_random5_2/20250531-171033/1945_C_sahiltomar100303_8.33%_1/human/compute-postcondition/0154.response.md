Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, and right is mid.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are still dependent on the number of '0' and '1' characters in the first and second halves of string `s`, respectively.
