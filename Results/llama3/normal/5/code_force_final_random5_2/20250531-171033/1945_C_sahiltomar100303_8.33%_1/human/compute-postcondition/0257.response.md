Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `right` is updated to `mid`, and the values of the other variables remain the same. The number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right` (`rightZero` and `trightZero`) and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right` (`trightOne`) are now considered up to index `mid`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
