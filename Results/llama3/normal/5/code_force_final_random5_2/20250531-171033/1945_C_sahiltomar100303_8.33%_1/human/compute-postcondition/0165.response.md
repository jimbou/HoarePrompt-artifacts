Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `n` is sufficiently greater than `mid` to allow either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` to be true. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one more than its original value and `trightZero` is one less than its original value. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is one more than its original value and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.***
