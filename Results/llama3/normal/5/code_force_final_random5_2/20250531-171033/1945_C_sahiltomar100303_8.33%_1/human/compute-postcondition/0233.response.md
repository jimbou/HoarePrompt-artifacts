Output State: **n is an integer and is at least mid + 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is mid + 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, rightZero is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right, trightZero is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right, rightOne is either one more or two more than the original value of rightOne, trightOne is either one more or two more than the original value of trightOne.**

In this final state, the values of `rightZero` and `trightZero` have been incremented by 1, indicating that there is one more '0' character in the second half of string `s` up to index `right`. The values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` have been either incremented by 1 or 2, depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', indicating that there is either one more or two more '1' characters in the second half of string `s` up to index `right`. All other variables remain unchanged.
