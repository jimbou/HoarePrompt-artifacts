Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to n // 4, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - left + 1) // 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index mid, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index mid minus 1, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index mid, leftMove is 0, right is mid, n is greater than mid, and tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus 1.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftMove`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, and the value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1.
