Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to (`n - left + 1`) // 2, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` and `trightOne` is less than (`n - right + 1`) // 2, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to `mid`. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are `right - mid` more than their original values and `trightZero` is `right - mid` less than its original value. If `s[right - 1]` is '1', then `leftOne` is `right - mid` more than its original value and `trightOne` is `right - mid` less than its original value.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the exception that `right` is now `n` and `n` is greater than or equal to `mid`. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `leftMove` remain unchanged. The value of `trightOne` is less than (`n - right + 1`) // 2, which is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The value of `tleftZero` is less than (`mid + right - mid`) // 2, which is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The value of `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, minus `right - mid` if `s[right - 1]` is '0', and the value of `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, plus `right - mid` if `s[right - 1]` is '0'. The value of `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, minus `right - mid` if `s[right - 1]` is '1', and the value of `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, plus `right - mid` if `s[right - 1]` is '1'.
