Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index i of string s is '0', then leftZero is 3, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 3, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0. If the character at index i of string s is '1', then leftZero is 2, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 2, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 2, trightOne is 0. Otherwise, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 1, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 1, trightOne is 0.**

The code increments the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` by 1. The initial values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` depend on the character at index `i` of string `s`. If the character is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are initially 2, so they become 3. If the character is '1', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are initially 1, so they become 2. Otherwise, `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are initially 0, so they become 1. The values of `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` remain unchanged.
