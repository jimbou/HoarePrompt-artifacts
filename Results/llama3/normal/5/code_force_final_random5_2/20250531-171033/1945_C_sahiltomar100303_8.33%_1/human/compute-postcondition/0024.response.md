To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(mid, n):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i`, `mid`, and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `mid`, which is `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1' and 0 otherwise, `tleftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `tleftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1' and 0 otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and `i` is equal to `mid + 1`**
