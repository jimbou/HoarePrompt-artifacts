Postcondition: **right is less than or equal to n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, and trightOne is 0. left is not equal to 0. If right is equal to n, then if tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, divided by 2, then the value of right which is n is being printed. Otherwise, the value of left is being printed. If right is less than n, then if the absolute difference between the middle index of the string s (calculated as (n + 1) // 2) and the current value of left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle index of the string s and the current value of right, then the value of left is being printed. Otherwise, the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right is strictly larger than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left, and right which is less than n is being printed.**
