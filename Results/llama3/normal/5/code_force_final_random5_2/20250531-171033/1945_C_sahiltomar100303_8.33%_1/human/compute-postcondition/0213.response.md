To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `mid`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `mid`. Since `i` is 0, we can increment it by 1 to make it 1. `mid` remains the same since it is not dependent on the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `right` is `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1` plus 1, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`**
