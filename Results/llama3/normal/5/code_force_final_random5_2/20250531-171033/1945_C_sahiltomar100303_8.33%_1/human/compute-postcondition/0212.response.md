Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `right` is `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1` plus 1, and `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, and `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1` plus 1.**
