Output State: **left is 0, right is mid + 1, n is sufficiently greater than mid to allow either tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2 to be true, tleftZero is one more than its original value, trightZero is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them. The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, and the value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1. The relationship between `n` and `mid` remains valid, allowing either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` to be true.
