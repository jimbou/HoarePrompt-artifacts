Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus one, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s minus one, rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s minus one if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one if s[right + 1] is '0' and must be less than (right + 2) // 2, otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s and must be less than (right + 2) // 2, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus one, trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s minus one if s[right + 1] is '0' and must be less than (n - right) // 2, otherwise it is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s and must be less than (n - right) // 2, leftMove is 0, i is equal to n, right is equal to mid + 1 and must be less than n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of right has been incremented by 1. The values of leftZero, leftOne, rightZero, rightOne, tleftZero, tleftOne, trightZero, and trightOne have been updated based on the new value of right. The other variables remain unchanged.
