Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string that allows for the conditions (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2) to be potentially true in the next iteration, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is one less than its previous value, `trightZero` is one more than its previous value, `tleftOne` is unchanged, and `trightOne` is unchanged. Otherwise, `leftOne` is one less than its original value, and `rightOne` is one more than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `left` being `mid - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `s[left - 1]` still apply.
