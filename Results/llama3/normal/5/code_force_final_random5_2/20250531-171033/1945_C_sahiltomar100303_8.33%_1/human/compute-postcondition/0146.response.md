Postcondition: **n is at least 3, s is a string that allows for the conditions (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2) to be potentially true in the next iteration, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, left is mid - 1, leftMove is 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is n, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. If s[left - 1] is '0', then tleftZero is one less than its previous value, trightZero is one more than its previous value, tleftOne is unchanged, and trightOne is unchanged. Otherwise, leftOne is one less than its original value, and rightOne is one more than its original value.**
