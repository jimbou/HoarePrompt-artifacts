Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: left is equal to 0, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, leftMove is equal to 0, i is equal to n, right is equal to mid, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: left is 0, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus one, rightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s minus one, rightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s minus one if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus one if s[right + 1] is '0' and must be less than (right + 2) // 2, otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s and must be less than (right + 2) // 2, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus one, trightZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s if s[right + 1] is '0', otherwise it is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, trightOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s minus one if s[right + 1] is '0' and must be less than (n - right) // 2, otherwise it is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s and must be less than (n - right) // 2, leftMove is 0, i is equal to n, right is equal to mid + 1 and must be less than n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The value of `right` is increased by 1, while the values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftMove`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The value of `right` is increased by 1, while the values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftMove`, `i`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, and `n` is greater than the new value of `right`. If `s[right]` is '0', then the value of `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and the value of `trightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then the value of `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and the value of `trightOne` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
