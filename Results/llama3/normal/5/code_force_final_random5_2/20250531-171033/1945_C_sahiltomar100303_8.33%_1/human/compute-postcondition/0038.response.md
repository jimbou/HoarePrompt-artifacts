Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s contains at least one '1' character and the second half of s contains at least one '0' character, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus one, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s minus one, rightZero and trightZero are equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne and trightOne are equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s plus one, left is equal to mid, leftMove is equal to 0, i is equal to n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The character at index left - 1 in string s is '0'.**

In this output state, the values of `leftOne` and `trightOne` have been decremented by 1 and the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` have been incremented by 1. The character at index `left - 1` in string `s` has been changed from '1' to '0'. All other variables remain unchanged.
