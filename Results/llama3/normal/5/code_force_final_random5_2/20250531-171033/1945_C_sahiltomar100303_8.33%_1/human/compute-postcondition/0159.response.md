Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus one, rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s minus one, right is mid, and n must be greater than mid. The character at index right in s is not '0'.**

The code increments `leftOne` by 1 and decrements `rightOne` by 1. No other variables are affected. The value of `leftOne` is now one more than the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, and the value of `rightOne` is one less than the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
