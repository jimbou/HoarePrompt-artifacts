Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to n // 4, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - left + 1) // 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus 1, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index mid, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index mid, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index mid minus 1 and trightOne is less than (n - (mid + 1) + 1) // 2, leftMove is 0, right is mid + 1, n is greater than mid + 1, tleftZero is less than (mid + 2) // 2**

The code increments `tleftOne` by 1 and decrements `trightOne` by 1. The value of `tleftOne` is now one more than the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, and the value of `trightOne` is one less than the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
