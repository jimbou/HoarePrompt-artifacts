Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and is at least `mid + 2`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `right` is `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `mid + 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `trightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` are either one more or two more than their original values. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightZero` and `trightZero` are either one more or the same as the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` are one more than their original values.**
