Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 3⋅10^5 (inclusive), s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 0, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is equal to mid.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `mid` is equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1' and 0 otherwise, `tleftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `tleftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1' and 0 otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and `i` is equal to `mid`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is equal to mid + 1. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are 2, and rightOne and trightOne are 1. If s[i] is '1', then rightZero and trightZero are 1, and rightOne and trightOne are 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is equal to mid + 2. If s[i-1] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are 3, and rightOne and trightOne are 1. If s[i-1] is '1', then rightZero and trightZero are 1, and rightOne and trightOne are 3. If s[i] is '0', then rightZero and trightZero are either 4 or 2, and rightOne and trightOne are either 1 or 3. If s[i] is '1', then rightZero is equal to 3 if s[i-1] is '0' otherwise 1, trightZero is equal to 3 if s[i-1] is '0' otherwise 1, rightOne is equal to 4 if s[i-1] is '0' otherwise 4, and trightOne is equal to 4 if s[i-1] is '0' otherwise 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
