Postcondition: ***right is equal to n, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index n - 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index n - 1, and trightOne is 0. left is not equal to 0. If tleftZero is greater than or equal to half of n plus one, divided by 2, then the value of right which is n is being printed. Otherwise, the value of left is being printed.***
