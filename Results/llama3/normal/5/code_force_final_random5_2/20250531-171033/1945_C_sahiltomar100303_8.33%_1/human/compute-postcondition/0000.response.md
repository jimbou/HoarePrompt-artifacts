The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t`. After executing this code, the value of `t` is assigned, and the stdin now contains the remaining test cases, which are the descriptions of the test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3⋅10^5) followed by a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
