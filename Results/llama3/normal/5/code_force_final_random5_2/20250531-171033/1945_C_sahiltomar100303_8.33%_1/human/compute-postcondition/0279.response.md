Output: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to (`n - left + 1`) // 2, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid` and `trightOne` is less than (`n - right + 1`) // 2, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is not equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to `mid`. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then the current value of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are `right - mid` more than their original values and the current value of `trightZero` is `right - mid` less than its original value. If `s[right - 1]` is '1', then the current value of `leftOne` is `right - mid` more than its original value and the current value of `trightOne` is `right - mid` less than its original value. Additionally, the current value of `left` is 0, and the value of `right` is being printed**
