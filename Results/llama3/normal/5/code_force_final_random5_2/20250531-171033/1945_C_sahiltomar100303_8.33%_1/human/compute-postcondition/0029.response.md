Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is equal to mid + 2, rightZero is either 4 or 2, trightZero is either 4 or 2, rightOne is either 1 or 3, and trightOne is either 1 or 3.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` are updated based on the initial values of `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, and `trightOne` and the increment operation performed on `rightZero` and `trightZero`. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
