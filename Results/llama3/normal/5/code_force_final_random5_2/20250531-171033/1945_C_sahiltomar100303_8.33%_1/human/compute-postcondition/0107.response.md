Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and at least 1, leftZero is 1, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 0, rightOne is 0, tleftZero is 1, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 0, trightOne is 0, left is 0 or not 0, right is n or not n, t is greater than 1, i is 0, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. The current value of s[i] is '0'.**

In this output state, the values of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` have been incremented by 1, reflecting the changes made by the code. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
