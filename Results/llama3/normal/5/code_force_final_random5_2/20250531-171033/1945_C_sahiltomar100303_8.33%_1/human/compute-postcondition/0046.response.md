The variables in the loop head are `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and `n`. If `left` is greater than 0 and either `leftZero` is less than (`left` + 1) // 2 or `rightOne` is less than (`n - left + 1`) // 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is greater than 0 and is one less than its previous value, `leftZero` is less than (`left` + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is less than (`n - left + 1`) // 2, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be greater than 0, and either `leftZero` must be less than (`left` + 1) // 2 or `rightOne` must be less than (`n - left + 1`) // 2. Since `left` is one less than its previous value, it needs to be adjusted to `left` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` contains at least one '1' character and the second half of `s` contains at least one '0' character, `mid` is equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is less than (`left` + 1) // 2, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is less than (`n - left + 1`) // 2, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `left` is greater than 1, `leftMove` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '1', then `leftOne` is one less than the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`.**
