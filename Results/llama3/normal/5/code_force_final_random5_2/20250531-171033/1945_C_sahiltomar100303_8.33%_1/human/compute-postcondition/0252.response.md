Output State: **n is an integer and is greater than 4, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 1, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is n - 1, leftZero is less than (n // 2 - 2 + 1) // 2 and either leftZero is less than n // 4 or rightOne is less than (n // 2 + 1) // 2, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, leftOne is one less than its original value, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right, rightOne is one more than its original value and is less than (n // 2 + 3) // 2 and either leftZero is less than n // 4 or rightOne is less than (n // 2 + 1) // 2, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right, left is mid - 2 and is greater than 0, leftMove is 0. If the character at index mid - 2 of s is '0', then the character at index mid - 2 of s is '0'. Otherwise, the character at index mid - 2 of s is not '0'. If the character at index left - 1 of s is '0', then the character at index left - 1 of s is '0'. Otherwise, the character at index left - 1 of s is not '0'.**
