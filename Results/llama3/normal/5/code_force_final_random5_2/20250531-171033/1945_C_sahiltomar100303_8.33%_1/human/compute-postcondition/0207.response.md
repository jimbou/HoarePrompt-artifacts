To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `mid`. The loop will execute if `mid` is at least 1, because `range(mid)` needs to have at least one value to iterate over.

State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `t` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 0**
