Postcondition: ***`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `n` is sufficiently greater than `mid`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` if `s[right - 1]` is '0', and `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2 - 1` if `s[right - 1]` is not '0'. If `s[right]` is '0', `trightZero` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is one more than its original value, and `trightOne` is one less than its original value.***
