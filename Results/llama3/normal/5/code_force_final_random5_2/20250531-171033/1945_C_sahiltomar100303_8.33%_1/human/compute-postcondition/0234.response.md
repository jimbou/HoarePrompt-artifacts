Output State: **n is an integer and is at least mid + 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is mid + 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, rightZero is either one more or the same as the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right, trightZero is either one more or the same as the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right, rightOne is one more than the original value, trightOne is one more than the original value.**

The code increments the values of `rightOne` and `trightOne` by 1, making them one more than their original values. No other variables are affected.
