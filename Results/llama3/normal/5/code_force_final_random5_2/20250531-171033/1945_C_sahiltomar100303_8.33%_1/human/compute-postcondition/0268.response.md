Postcondition: ***left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to n // 4, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - left + 1) // 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index mid, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index mid, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index mid and trightOne is less than (n - (mid + 1) + 1) // 2, leftMove is 0, right is mid + 1, n is greater than mid + 1, tleftZero is less than (mid + 2) // 2. If s[right] is '0', then leftZero and tleftZero are 1 more than their original values and trightZero is 1 less than its original value. If s[right] is '1', then leftOne is 1 more than its original value and trightOne is 1 less than its original value.***
