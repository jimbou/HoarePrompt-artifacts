The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least mid + 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, mid is equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least mid + 1 and i is now mid.
State: **`n` is an integer and is at least mid + 1, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to n // 2 and is greater than 0, `right` is n, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is mid, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index right - 1**
