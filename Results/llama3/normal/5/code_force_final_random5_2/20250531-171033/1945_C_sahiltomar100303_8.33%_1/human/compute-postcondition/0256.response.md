Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 4`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `leftMove` is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `left` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the first half of the string `s`. The number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` (`leftZero`) is less than or equal to `n // 4`, and the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right` (`rightOne`) is less than or equal to `(n - left + 1) // 2`. The number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` (`leftOne`) remains unchanged, and the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right` (`rightZero`) and the total number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right` (`trightZero`) also remain unchanged. Similarly, the total number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right` (`trightOne`) remains unchanged. Finally, `leftMove` remains 0, indicating that no additional moves were made during the loop iterations.
