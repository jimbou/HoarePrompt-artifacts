Output State: **n is at least 2, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is mid - 1, leftMove is 0, right is n, t is greater than 1, i is n, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the character at index left - 1 in s is '0', then leftZero is one less than the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s. Otherwise, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, leftOne is one less than the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, and rightOne is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of s.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `left` has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are still dependent on the character at index `left - 1` in string `s`.
