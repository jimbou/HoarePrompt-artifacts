Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and is at least `mid + (n - mid)`, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `right` is `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `leftZero` is less than `(n + 2) // 4`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 2) // 4`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0. The current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**
