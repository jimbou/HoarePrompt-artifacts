Output State: **n is at least 1, s is a string, mid is an integer equal to n // 2, leftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is 2 if s[i] is '0' otherwise it is 1, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1' otherwise it is 0, tleftZero is the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, trightZero is 2 if s[i] is '0' otherwise it is 1, tleftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, trightOne is 1 if s[i] is '1' otherwise it is 0, left is 0 or not 0, right is n or not n, t is greater than 1, i is mid + 1, n must be greater than mid + 1, and stdin contains 1 input: a string.**

The code increments `rightZero` and `trightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` and `trightZero` were 1 if `s[i]` is '0' otherwise they were 0, now they are 2 if `s[i]` is '0' otherwise they are 1. No other variables are affected.
