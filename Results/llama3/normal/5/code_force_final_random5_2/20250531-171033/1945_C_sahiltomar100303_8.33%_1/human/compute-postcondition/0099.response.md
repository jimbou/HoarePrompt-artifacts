Output: **right is not equal to n, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, trightZero is equal to 0, trightOne is equal to 0, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is equal to 0, rightOne is equal to 0, leftMove is equal to 0, i is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and left is not equal to 0. The absolute difference between the middle index of the string and the right index is greater than the absolute difference between the middle index of the string and the left index, and the value of right which is not equal to n is being printed**
