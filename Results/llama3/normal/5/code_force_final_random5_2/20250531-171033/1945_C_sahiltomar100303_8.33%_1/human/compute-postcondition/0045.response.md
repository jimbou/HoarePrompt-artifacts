Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` contains at least one '1' character and the second half of `s` contains at least one '0' character, `mid` is equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is less than (`left` + 1) // 2, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is less than (`n - left + 1`) // 2, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `left` is greater than 0 and is one less than its previous value, `leftMove` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '1', then `leftOne` is one less than the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, and its new value is one less than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state. The string `s` still consists of 0 and 1 characters, with the first half containing at least one '1' and the second half containing at least one '0'. The values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` are updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in string `s`.
