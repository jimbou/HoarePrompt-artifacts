Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a string of 0s and 1s. It then finds the index that divides the string into two halves with the most balanced distribution of 0s and 1s. If there are multiple such indices, it returns the one closest to the middle of the string. The function prints the index of the most balanced division for each test case.**
