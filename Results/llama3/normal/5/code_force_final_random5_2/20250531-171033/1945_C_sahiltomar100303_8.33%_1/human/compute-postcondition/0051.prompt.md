Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero and trightZero are equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne and trightOne are equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is equal to mid, leftMove is equal to 0, i is equal to n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s contains at least one '1' character and the second half of s contains at least one '0' character, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero and trightZero are equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne and trightOne are equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is equal to mid - 1, leftMove is equal to 0, i is equal to n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '0', then leftZero is one less than the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, trightZero is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '1', then leftOne is one less than the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, trightOne is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of s.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of `s` contains at least one '1' character and the second half of `s` contains at least one '0' character, `mid` is equal to `n // 2`, `leftZero` is less than (`left` + 1) // 2, `leftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` and `trightZero` are equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is less than (`n - left + 1`) // 2, `trightOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `left` is greater than 0 and is one less than its previous value, `leftMove` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is one less than the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`. If the character at index `left - 1` in string `s` is '1', then `leftOne` is one less than the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s contains at least one '1' character and the second half of s contains at least one '0' character, mid is equal to n // 2, left is greater than 0, leftMove is equal to 0, i is equal to n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '0', then leftZero is one less than the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero and trightZero are one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '1', then leftOne is one less than the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne and trightOne are one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of s.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
