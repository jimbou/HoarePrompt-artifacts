Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 0, s is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where the first half of s contains at least one '1' character and the second half of s contains at least one '0' character, mid is equal to n // 2, leftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, leftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, tleftZero is equal to the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, tleftOne is equal to the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightZero and trightZero are equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, rightOne and trightOne are equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, left is equal to mid - 1, leftMove is equal to 0, i is equal to n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '0', then leftZero is one less than the number of '0' characters in the first half of s, rightZero is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s, trightZero is one more than the number of '0' characters in the second half of s. If the character at index left - 1 in string s is '1', then leftOne is one less than the number of '1' characters in the first half of s, rightOne is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of s, trightOne is one more than the number of '1' characters in the second half of s.**

The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `left` being equal to `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
