Output State: **left is 0, leftZero is less than or equal to n // 4, rightOne is less than or equal to (n - left + 1) // 2, leftOne is the number of '1' characters in the first half of s plus one, rightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index mid, trightZero is the number of '0' characters in the second half of s up to index mid, trightOne is the number of '1' characters in the second half of s up to index mid minus one and trightOne is less than (n - mid + 1) // 2, leftMove is 0, right is mid, n is greater than mid, and the character at index right in s is '1'.**

The first line increments `tleftOne` by 1, making it one more than the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`. The second line decrements `trightOne` by 1, making it one less than the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `mid`. No other variables are affected.
