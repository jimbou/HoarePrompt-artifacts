Postcondition: **`n` is at least 1, `s` is a string, `mid` is an integer equal to `n` // 2, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 0, `left` is 0 or not 0, `right` is `n` or not `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is `mid`, `n` must be greater than `mid`, and stdin contains 1 input: a string. The current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**
