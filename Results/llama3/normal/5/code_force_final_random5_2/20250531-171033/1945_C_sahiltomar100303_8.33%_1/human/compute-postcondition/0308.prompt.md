Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3⋅10^5) followed by a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The program prints the value of either `left` or `right` based on the conditions. If `left` is 0, the program prints the value of `right` if it is not equal to `n`, otherwise it prints the value of `left` if the number of '1' characters in the right half of the string `s` is greater than or equal to half of the total length of `s` plus one, otherwise it prints the value of `right`. If `left` is not 0, the program prints the value of `right` (which is equal to `n`) if the total number of '0' characters in both halves of string `s` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus one and `right` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, if `right` is not equal to `n`, the program prints the value of either `left` or `right` (which is not equal to `n`), depending on which index has a smaller absolute difference with the middle index of `s`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s` plus the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s` up to index `right - 1`, and `trightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, and the total number of '1' characters in the string `s` is greater than or equal to half of the length of `s` plus one, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed. If `left` is not equal to 0, then if `right` is equal to `n`, the value of `right` which is `n` is printed if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to half of `n` plus one, divided by 2, otherwise the value of `left` is printed. If `right` is less than `n`, then the value of `left` is printed if the absolute difference between the middle index of the string `s` and the current value of `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the middle index of the string `s` and the current value of `right`, otherwise the value of `right` which is less than `n` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`left` and `right` are printed based on the conditions of `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `leftMove`, `n`, `mid`, `s[right - 1]`. If `left` is 0, then if `right` is not equal to `n`, the value of `right` is printed. If `right` is equal to `n`, then if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to (`n + 1`) // 2, the value of `left` which is 0 is printed. Otherwise, the value of `right` which is equal to `n` is printed. If `left` is not 0, then if `right` is equal to `n`, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (`n + 1`) // 2, the value of `right` which is `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `left` which is not 0 is printed. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then if the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `right`, the value of `left` is printed. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `right` is less than the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `left`, the value of `right` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
