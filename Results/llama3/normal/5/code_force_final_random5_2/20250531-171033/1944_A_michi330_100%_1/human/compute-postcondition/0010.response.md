The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the integer 1 is printed. Otherwise, if `k` is less than `n - 1`, the value of `n` is printed.**
