The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers, n and k. It then prints the minimum number of operations required to make all pairs of elements in a set of n elements connected, given that k connections already exist. If k is greater than or equal to n-1, it prints 1, indicating that all elements are already connected. Otherwise, it prints n, indicating that n-1 connections are needed to connect all elements. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.
