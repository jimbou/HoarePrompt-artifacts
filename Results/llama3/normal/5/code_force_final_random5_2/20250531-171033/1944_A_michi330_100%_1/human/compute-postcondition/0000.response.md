The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2). After reading the first integer, the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2).**
