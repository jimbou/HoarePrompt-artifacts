Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `i` is `t`, `n` and `k` are integers that were inputted from stdin which is now empty. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` which is an integer that was inputted from stdin is being printed, and either the number 1 or the value of `n` is being printed, depending on the else part.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations, and the final values of `i`, `n`, and `k` are the last values read from stdin. The output is either 1 or the value of `n`, depending on the condition `k >= n - 1`.
