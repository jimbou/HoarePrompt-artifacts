To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1, and `i` to be 0 (the starting value of the range).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `i` is 0**
