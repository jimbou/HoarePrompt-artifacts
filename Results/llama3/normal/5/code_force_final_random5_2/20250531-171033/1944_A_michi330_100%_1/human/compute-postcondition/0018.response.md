Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers that were inputted from stdin which is now empty, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `n` which is an integer that was inputted from stdin is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the new integers inputted from stdin. The stdin is now empty. The condition for printing the number 1 or the value of `n` is still dependent on the values of `k` and `n`.
