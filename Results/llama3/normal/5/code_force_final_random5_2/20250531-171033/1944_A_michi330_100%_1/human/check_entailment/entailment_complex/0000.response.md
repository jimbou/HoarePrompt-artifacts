Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem requires finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The program correctly implements the logic to solve this problem.

The key insight is that if Dominater can destroy at least n-1 bridges, then Everule can only visit island 1, because all other islands can be disconnected from island 1 by destroying the bridges between them. This is handled by the condition `if k >= n - 1: print(1)`.

On the other hand, if Dominater cannot destroy at least n-1 bridges, then Everule can always find a path to visit all other islands, because there will always be at least one bridge connecting each island to island 1. This is handled by the condition `else: print(n)`.

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.

Correctness: **True**
