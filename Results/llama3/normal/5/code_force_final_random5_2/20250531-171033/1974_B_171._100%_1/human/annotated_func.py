#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with `len_unique` key-value pairs where each key is a character from `unique_chars` and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored index in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`, `i` is `len_unique - 1`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string 'decoded' where each character from the original string 'encoded' is replaced by its corresponding mirrored character in the list of unique characters 'unique_chars', in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:Replaces each character in the input string with its mirrored character in the list of unique characters, in ascending order, and returns the resulting string.
