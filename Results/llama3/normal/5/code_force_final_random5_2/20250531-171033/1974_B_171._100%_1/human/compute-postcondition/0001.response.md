To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `len_unique`. The loop will execute if `len_unique` is at least 1.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in ascending order that must have at least 1 character, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded` that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
