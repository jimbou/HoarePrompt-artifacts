Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary with `len_unique` key-value pairs where each key is a character from `unique_chars` and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored index in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`, `i` is `len_unique - 1`, `decoded` is a string where each character from `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`.**

In this output state, the new variable `decoded` is introduced, which is a string where each character from `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`. The other variables remain unchanged.
