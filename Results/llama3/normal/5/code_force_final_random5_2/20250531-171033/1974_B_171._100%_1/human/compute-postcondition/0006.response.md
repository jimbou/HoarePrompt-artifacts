Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in ascending order that must have at least 3 characters, `char_map` is a dictionary with four key-value pairs where the key is the character at index `0` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1` in `unique_chars` and the key is the character at index `1` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 2` in `unique_chars` and the key is the character at index `2` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 3` in `unique_chars` and the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded` that must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the code has added a new key-value pair to the `char_map` dictionary, where the key is the character at index `i` (which is 2) in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` (which is `len_unique - 3`) in `unique_chars`. The other variables remain unchanged.
