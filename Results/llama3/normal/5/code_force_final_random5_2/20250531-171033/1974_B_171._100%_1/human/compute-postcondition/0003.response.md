The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and len_unique, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len_unique`. If `i` is less than `len_unique`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `len_unique` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `len_unique` must be greater than 1.
State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in ascending order that must have at least 2 characters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded` that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
