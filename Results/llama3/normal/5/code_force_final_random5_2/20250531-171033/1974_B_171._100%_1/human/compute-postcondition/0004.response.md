Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded` in ascending order that must have at least 2 characters, `char_map` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the character at index `0` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 1` in `unique_chars` and the key is the character at index `1` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 2` in `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded` that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `char_map` has been updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is the character at index `1` in `unique_chars` and the value is the character at index `len_unique - 2` in `unique_chars`. The other variables remain unchanged.
