Reasoning:

1. The problem description is clear and well-defined, and the provided Python program appears to be a correct implementation of the decoding algorithm.

2. The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases and the encoded strings.

3. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.

4. Inside `func_1`, the program first finds the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order. This is done using the `set` data structure and the `sorted` function.

5. The program then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character to its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters. This is done using a loop that iterates over the indices of the sorted list and assigns the character at the current index to the character at the mirrored index.

6. Finally, the program uses a generator expression to iterate over the characters in the encoded string, replacing each character with its symmetric character using the `char_map` dictionary. The resulting decoded string is then returned.

7. The program appends the decoded string for each test case to the `results` list and prints the results at the end.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the provided Python program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
