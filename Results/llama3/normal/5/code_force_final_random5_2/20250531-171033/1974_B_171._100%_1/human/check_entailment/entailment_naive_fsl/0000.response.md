Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program creates a set of unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order. This is done using the `sorted(set(encoded))` expression.

4. The program then creates a character mapping `char_map` that maps each unique character to its symmetric character in the sorted list. This is done using a dictionary comprehension.

5. The program then decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its symmetric character using the `char_map`. This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` function.

6. Finally, the program prints the decoded string for each test case.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement, and it handles all potential cases correctly. The use of a set to get unique characters, sorting to get the characters in alphabetical order, and a dictionary to map characters to their symmetric characters are all correct and efficient approaches.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
