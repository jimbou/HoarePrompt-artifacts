Output State: **`ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3, `len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the second character of the list `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `ret`, `thorn`, `len`, `s`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the second character of the list `s`. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
