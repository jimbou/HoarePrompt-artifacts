Postcondition: ***`ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the second character of the list `s`. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. If `i` is not '*', then the program continues with the current state, having checked the condition `thorn == 0` without storing its result in any variable.***
