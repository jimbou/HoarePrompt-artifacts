Postcondition: ***`ret` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list, stdin is empty. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1, 2 or 3. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
