According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, ret is 0 and thorn is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list `s` must have at least 1 character and `i` is the first character in the list.
State: **`ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `len` is an integer read from stdin, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character read from stdin, `i` is the first character in the list, stdin is empty**
