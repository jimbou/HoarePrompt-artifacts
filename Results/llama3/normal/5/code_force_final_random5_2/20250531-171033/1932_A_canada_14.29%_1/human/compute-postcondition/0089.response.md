Postcondition: ***`ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2, `len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list, stdin is empty. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 2. Otherwise, `thorn` is 1 and `ret` is 0. If `i` is not '*' or '@', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `thorn` is 2.***
