Output State: **`ret` is either 0, 1 or 2, `thorn` is either 1, 2 or 3, `len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `ret`, `thorn`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. The stdin remains empty.
