To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and understand how the variables involved in it change.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the state), `int(input())`, and implicitly, `stdin` because `input()` reads from the standard input.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `ret` is either 0 or the number of '@' characters in the list `s`.
- `thorn` is either 0 or 1.
- `len` is an integer greater than 1.
- `s` is a list of characters.
- `stdin` is empty.
- The value of `ret` is being printed.

To execute the loop again, we need to consider what changes:
- `_` doesn't affect the state, so we ignore it.
- `int(input())` needs to be able to provide another integer for the loop to continue. Since `stdin` is empty at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `stdin` must not be empty; it must contain at least one more integer.
- The other variables (`ret`, `thorn`, `len`, `s`) are not directly involved in the loop condition, so their states do not need to change for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the state of `stdin`, which must contain at least one more integer.

State: **`ret` is either 0 or the number of '@' characters in the list `s`, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters, `stdin` is not empty and contains at least one integer**
