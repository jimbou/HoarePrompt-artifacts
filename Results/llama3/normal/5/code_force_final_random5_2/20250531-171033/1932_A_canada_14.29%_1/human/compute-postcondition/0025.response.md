Output State: **`ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the third character of the list `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
