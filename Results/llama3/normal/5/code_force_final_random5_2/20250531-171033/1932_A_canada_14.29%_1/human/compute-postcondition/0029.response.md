Postcondition: ***`ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the third character of the list `s`. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `i` is not '*', the program has checked if `thorn` is equal to 0.***
