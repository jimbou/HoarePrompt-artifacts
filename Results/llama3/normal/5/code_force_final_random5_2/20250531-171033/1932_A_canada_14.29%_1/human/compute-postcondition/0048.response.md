Postcondition: ***`ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, and `stdin` is empty. If the first character in the list `s` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the first character in the list `s` is '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1. If the first character in the list `s` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0. If `thorn` is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
