The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, len is an integer greater than 0, ret is 0, thorn is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 character and the i is the first character in the list.
State: **len is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, i is the first character in the list, ret is 0, thorn is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
