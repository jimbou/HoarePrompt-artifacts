Postcondition: **The program's state is updated based on the first character 'i' of the list 's'. If 'i' is '@', then 'ret' is set to 1. If 'i' is '*', then if 'thorn' was initially 1, 'thorn' is now 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If 'i' is '*' and 'thorn' was not 1, the program's state remains unchanged. If 'i' is not '*' or '@', then a boolean expression 'thorn == 0' has been evaluated to True. In all cases, 'len' remains an integer greater than 0, 's' remains a list of characters with at least 1 character, and 'stdin' remains empty.**
