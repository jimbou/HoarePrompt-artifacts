The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input(). If the input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
