Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters consisting of '.', '@', and '*' characters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn == 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ret is an integer greater than or equal to 0, thorn is either 0, 1, or 2, len is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of characters, stdin is empty, and the value of ret which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ret is either 0 or the number of '@' characters in the list s, thorn is either 0 or 1, len is an integer greater than 1, s is a list of characters, stdin is empty, and the value of ret which is either 0 or the number of '@' characters in the list s is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ret is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, thorn is 0, len is an integer, s is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, stdin is empty, and the value of ret which is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
