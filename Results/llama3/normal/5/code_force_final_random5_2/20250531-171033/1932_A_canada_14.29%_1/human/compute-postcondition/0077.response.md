Output State: **`ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, `len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `i` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `ret`, `thorn`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement.
