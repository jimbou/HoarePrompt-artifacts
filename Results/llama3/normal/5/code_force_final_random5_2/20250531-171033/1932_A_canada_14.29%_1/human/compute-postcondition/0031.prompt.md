Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: len is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of characters, ret is 0, thorn is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program's state is updated based on the first character 'i' of the list 's'. If 'i' is '@', then 'ret' is set to 1. If 'i' is '*', then if 'thorn' was initially 1, 'thorn' is now 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If 'i' is '*' and 'thorn' was not 1, the program's state remains unchanged. If 'i' is not '*' or '@', then a boolean expression 'thorn == 0' has been evaluated to True. In all cases, 'len' remains an integer greater than 0, 's' remains a list of characters with at least 1 character, and 'stdin' remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the second character of the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 1 or 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then the program continues with the current state, having checked the condition `thorn == 0` without storing its result in any variable.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ret` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the third character of the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 1, 2, or 3 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', the program has checked if `thorn` is equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
