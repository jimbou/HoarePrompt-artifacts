Output State: **`ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1 or 2, `len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 2. Otherwise, `thorn` is 1 and `ret` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `ret`, `thorn`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions that determine the values of `ret` and `thorn` based on the value of `i` are still valid.
