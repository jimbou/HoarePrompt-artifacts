Output State: **`ret` is either 0, 1 or 2, `thorn` is either 1, 2 or 3, `len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1, 2, or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still has at least 3 characters, and `i` is still the third character in the list. The stdin remains empty.
