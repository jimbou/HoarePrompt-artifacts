Output State: **`ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list, stdin is empty. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 1. Otherwise, `thorn` is 0 and `ret` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `thorn` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `thorn` is checked to be equal to 0. If `thorn` is indeed 0, the program continues to execute. If `thorn` is not 0, the program does not execute the next lines of code. The values of `ret`, `len`, `s`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged. The conditions for `ret` and `thorn` based on the value of `i` are still valid. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
