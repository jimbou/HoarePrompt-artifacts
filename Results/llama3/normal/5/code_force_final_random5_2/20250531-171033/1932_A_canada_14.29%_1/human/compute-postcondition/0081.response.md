Postcondition: ***`ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, `len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list, stdin is empty, and `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 1. Otherwise, `thorn` is 0. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
