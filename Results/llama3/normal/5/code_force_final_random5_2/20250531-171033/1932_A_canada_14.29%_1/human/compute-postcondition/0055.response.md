Postcondition: ***`ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
