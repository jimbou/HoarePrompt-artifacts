Output State: **`ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1 or 2, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the second character in the list `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
