Output State: **`ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` is empty, and the first character in the list `s` is '*', and the current value of `i` is '*'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still has at least one character and its first character is still '*'. The value of `i` is still '*'. The `ret` is still 0 and `len` is still an integer greater than 1. The `stdin` is still empty.
