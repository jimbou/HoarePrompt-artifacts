Postcondition: ***`ret` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the comparison `thorn == 0` evaluates to True if `thorn` is 0, and False otherwise.***
