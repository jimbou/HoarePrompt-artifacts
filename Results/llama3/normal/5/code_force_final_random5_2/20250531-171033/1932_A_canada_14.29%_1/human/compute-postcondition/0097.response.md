Postcondition: ***`ret` is either 0, 1 or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1, 2 or 3. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
