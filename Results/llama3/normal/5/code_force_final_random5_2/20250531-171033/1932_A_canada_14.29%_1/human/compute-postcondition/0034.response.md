The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`ret` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2, `len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `ret` which is an integer greater than or equal to 0 is being printed, `int(input())` is greater than 1**
