Output State: **len is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, the first character i is '*', ret is 0, thorn was 1, _ was 0, stdin is empty, and the current value of the first character i is still '*', and the current value of thorn is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables len, s, i, ret, thorn, _, and stdin remain unchanged.
