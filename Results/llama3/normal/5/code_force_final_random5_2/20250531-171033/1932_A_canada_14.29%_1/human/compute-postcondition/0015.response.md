To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in s:`, which means we're iterating over the list `s`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, which takes on the value of the next character in the list `s` during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` was the first character of the list `s`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next character in the list `s`.

Since `s` remains a list of characters with at least 1 character, and `len` remains an integer greater than 0, we can conclude that there are more characters in the list `s` to iterate over.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ret` is either 0 or 1 (depending on the previous value of `i`), `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2 (depending on the previous value of `i` and `thorn`), `len` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the second character of the list `s`.**

Note that the values of `ret` and `thorn` are not explicitly updated in the loop head, so their values remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
