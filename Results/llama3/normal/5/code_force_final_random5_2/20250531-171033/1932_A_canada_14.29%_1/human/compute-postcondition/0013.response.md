Postcondition: ***len is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of characters with at least 1 character, i is the first character in the list, ret is 0, thorn is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty, and the first character i is not '@'. If i is '*', then if thorn was initially 1, thorn is now 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If i is '*', and thorn was not 1, then the program's state remains unchanged. If i is not '*', then the first character i is not '*', and a boolean expression thorn == 0 has been evaluated to True.***
