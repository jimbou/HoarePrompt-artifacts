Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ret is 0, thorn is 0, len is an integer greater than 1, s is a list of characters, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, and `stdin` is empty. If the first character in the list `s` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the first character in the list `s` is '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1. If the first character in the list `s` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0. If `thorn` is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ret` is either 0, 1 or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 1 or 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ret` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2 and the comparison `thorn == 0` evaluates to True if `thorn` is 0, and False otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
