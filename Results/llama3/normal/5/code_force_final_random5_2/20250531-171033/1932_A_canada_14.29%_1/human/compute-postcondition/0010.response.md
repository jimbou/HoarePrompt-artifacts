Postcondition: **The program's state is as follows: len is an integer greater than 0, s is a list of characters with at least 1 character, the first character i is '*', ret is 0, and stdin is empty. If thorn was initially 1, then thorn is now 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If thorn was not 1, then the program's state remains unchanged.**
