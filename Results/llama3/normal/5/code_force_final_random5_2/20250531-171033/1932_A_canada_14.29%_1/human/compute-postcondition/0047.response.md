Postcondition: ***`ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, `len` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` is empty, and the first character in the list `s` is either '*' or not equal to '@' and '*'. If the first character in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is 1, otherwise `thorn` is 0. If `thorn` is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
