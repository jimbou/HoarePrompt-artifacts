#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: T is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is T, n is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, i is x - 1, num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1, and count is the number of times num is 1 for all iterations of the loop. If num is 1, count is incremented by 1., and this is printed: the sum of count and x minus 2

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. For each test case, it sorts the integers, counts the number of times the difference between consecutive integers is 1, and also checks if the difference between the first integer and 1, and the last integer and n, is 1. Finally, it prints the sum of the count and x minus 2 for each test case.
