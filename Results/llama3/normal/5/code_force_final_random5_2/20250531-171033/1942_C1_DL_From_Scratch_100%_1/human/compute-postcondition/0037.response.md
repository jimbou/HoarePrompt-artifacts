Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`. If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 2. If `num` is not 1, `count` is increased by 1.**
