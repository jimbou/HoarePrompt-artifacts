This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. For each test case, it sorts the integers, counts the number of times the difference between consecutive integers is 1, and also checks if the difference between the first integer and 1, and the last integer and n, is 1. Finally, it prints the sum of the count and x minus 2 for each test case.
