Output State: **`T` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `T` is assigned the integer value from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been read to assign the value to `T`. The rest of the test cases remain unchanged, with each test case consisting of two lines: the first line containing three integers (n, x, and y) and the second line containing x distinct integers from 1 to n.
