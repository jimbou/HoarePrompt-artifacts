The value of `num` is updated to be `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. Since `i` is 1, this is equivalent to `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`. The value of `num` is now the difference between the second and third elements of `list0`, minus 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, and `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, and `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1**
