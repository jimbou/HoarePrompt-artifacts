Postcondition: ***T is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer that is at least 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 0, and the current value of num is equal to list0[1] - list0[0] - 1. If num is 1, count is 1. Otherwise, count remains 0.***
