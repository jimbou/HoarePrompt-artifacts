Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer that is at least 3, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`. If `num` is 1, `count` is 3, otherwise `count` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.***
