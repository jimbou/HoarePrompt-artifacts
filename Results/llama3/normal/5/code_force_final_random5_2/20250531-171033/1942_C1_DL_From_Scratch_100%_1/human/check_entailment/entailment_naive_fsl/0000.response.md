Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. The program first sorts the list of chosen vertices and then iterates through the list to count the number of pairs of adjacent vertices that can form a diagonal. The program also checks the distance between the first and last vertices to see if they can form a diagonal. The program then adds the number of pairs of adjacent vertices and the number of diagonals that can be formed between the first and last vertices to get the total number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

The program correctly handles the case where y = 0, which means that no additional vertices can be chosen. In this case, the program only considers the chosen vertices and calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using these vertices.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of chosen vertices is 2, in which case the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake is 2.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.
