Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, and `count` is the number of times `num` is 1 for all iterations of the loop. If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1.***
