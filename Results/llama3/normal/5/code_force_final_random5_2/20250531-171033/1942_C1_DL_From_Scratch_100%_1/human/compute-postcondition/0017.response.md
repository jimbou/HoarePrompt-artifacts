Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is x - 1, num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1, count is either x - 1 or x - 2 depending on the value of num.**

The value of num is updated to be the sum of the first element of list0, n, minus the last element of list0, minus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers. The value of count is either x - 1 or x - 2, depending on whether num is 1 or not.
