The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 1.
State: **T is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is x - 1, num is list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1. If num is 1, count is either x or x - 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of count + x - 2 is being printed**
