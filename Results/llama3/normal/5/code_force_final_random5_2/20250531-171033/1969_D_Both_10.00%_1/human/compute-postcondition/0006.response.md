Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs of integers, `sub_summ` is equal to the first element of the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr` plus the first element of the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr` plus the first element of the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of pairs of integers `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged, with `sec_arr` still having at least 3 pairs of integers. The variable `sub_summ` now holds the sum of the first element of the third pair of integers in `sec_arr` added to itself twice, and `val_a` is still the third pair of integers in `sec_arr`.
