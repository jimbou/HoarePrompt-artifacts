The only variable in the loop head is `val_b` and `main_ar`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `main_ar`.  If the list has at least 3 pairs of integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `main_ar` has at least 2 pairs of integers, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 pairs of integers and the `val_b` is the third pair of integers in the list.
State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. If the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of all elements of all pairs of integers in the list `main_ar` plus the sum of `val_b`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar` plus the sum of `val_b`.**
