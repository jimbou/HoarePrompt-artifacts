Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of all elements of all pairs of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. The current value of `val_b` is such that the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `sub_summ` has been updated to include the sum of the elements of the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, which is `val_b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `main_ar` still has at least one pair of integers, `sec_arr` is still empty, and `val_a` is still the last pair of integers in `main_ar`. The sum of the elements of `val_b` is still greater than or equal to 0.
