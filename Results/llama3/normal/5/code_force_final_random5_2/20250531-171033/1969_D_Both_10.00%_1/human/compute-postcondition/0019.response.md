Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar` plus the sum of all pairs of integers in the list `main_ar` that have a sum greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `main_ar` remains unchanged, `sec_arr` remains empty, and `val_a` remains the last pair of integers in `main_ar`. The variable `sub_summ` is updated to include the sum of all pairs of integers in `main_ar` that have a sum greater than or equal to 0, in addition to the initial sum of the first elements of all pairs in `main_ar`.
