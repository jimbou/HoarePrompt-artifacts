Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of all elements of all pairs of integers in the list `main_ar` plus twice the sum of `val_b` if the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar` plus twice the sum of `val_b`.**

In this output state, the value of `sub_summ` has been updated by adding the sum of `val_b` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `sub_summ` is still dependent on the sum of the elements of `val_b`, but now it includes the additional sum of `val_b` that was added in the code.
