Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1`, which correctly reads an integer from standard input.

2. For each test case, the program reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_2`, which correctly converts a space-separated list of integers from standard input into a map object containing a sequence of integers.

3. The program then reads the lists of integers `a` and `b` using `func_2`, which correctly converts a space-separated list of integers from standard input into a map object containing a sequence of integers.

4. The program sorts the list of pairs `arr` based on the second element of each pair in ascending order.

5. The program then iterates over the sorted list `arr` and pushes the last `k` elements into the heap `k_arr`.

6. The program calculates the initial sum `sub_sum` by calling `func_3` with the remaining elements in `arr` and the elements in `k_arr`.

7. The program then iterates over the remaining elements in `arr` and updates the sum `sub_sum` by subtracting the second element of the current pair and adding the first element of the current pair if the sum of the first and second elements is less than or equal to 0.

8. The program also updates the heap `k_arr` by pushing the current pair and popping the smallest element.

9. The program repeats steps 7 and 8 until all elements in `arr` have been processed.

10. Finally, the program prints the maximum sum `max_value` found during the iterations.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize Alice's profit by considering all possible scenarios and choosing the one that results in the maximum profit. The use of a heap to store the `k` largest elements and the iterative approach to update the sum and the heap ensure that the program runs efficiently and correctly.
