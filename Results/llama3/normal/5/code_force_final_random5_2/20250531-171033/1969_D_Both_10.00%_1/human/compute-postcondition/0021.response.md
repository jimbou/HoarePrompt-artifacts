Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the input list `main_ar`, plus the sum of all pairs of integers in `main_ar` that have a total value greater than or equal to 0. It does not modify the input lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, but it does empty `sec_arr` and uses its initial values to calculate a partial sum. The function effectively ignores the values in `sec_arr` after emptying it, and focuses solely on the pairs in `main_ar` for its final calculation.**
