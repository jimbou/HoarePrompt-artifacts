To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only object in the loop head is `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least 2 pairs of integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sec_arr` has at least 1 pair of integers, `val_a` is the first pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least 2 pairs of integers and `val_a` is the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs of integers, `sub_summ` is equal to the first element of the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.**
