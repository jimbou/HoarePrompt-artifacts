Postcondition: ***`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. The current value of `val_b` is such that the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to 0***
