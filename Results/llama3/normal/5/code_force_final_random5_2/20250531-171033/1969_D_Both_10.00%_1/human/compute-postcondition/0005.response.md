To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for val_a in sec_arr:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least one more pair of integers, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `sec_arr` has at least 2 pairs of integers, `val_a` is the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`, and `sub_summ` is equal to the first element of the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr` plus the first element of the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.

For the loop to execute again, `sec_arr` must have at least 3 pairs of integers, and `val_a` must be the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs of integers, `sub_summ` is equal to the first element of the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr` plus the first element of the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the third pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.**
