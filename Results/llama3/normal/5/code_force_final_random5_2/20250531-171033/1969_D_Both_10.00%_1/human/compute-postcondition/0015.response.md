Postcondition: ***`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. If the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of all elements of all pairs of integers in the list `main_ar` plus the sum of `val_b`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar` plus the sum of `val_b`.***
