Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial list `sec_arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the list `main_ar` remains unchanged, the list `sec_arr` is empty because all its elements have been processed, the variable `sub_summ` holds the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers that were initially in the list `sec_arr`, and the variable `val_a` holds the last pair of integers that was processed from the list `sec_arr`.
