Output State: `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial list `sec_arr`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `main_ar` remains unchanged, `sec_arr` is empty because all its elements have been processed, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial `sec_arr`, and `val_a` is the last pair of integers that was processed from `sec_arr`.
