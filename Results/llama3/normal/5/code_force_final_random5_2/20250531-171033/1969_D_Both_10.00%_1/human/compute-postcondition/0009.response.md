To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `val_b` and `main_ar`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `main_ar`. If `main_ar` has at least 1 pair of integers, the loop can execute. 

State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`**
