Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the initial list `sec_arr`.
Code of the loop:
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. If the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of all elements of all pairs of integers in the list `main_ar`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. If the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of all elements of all pairs of integers in the list `main_ar` plus the sum of `val_b`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar` plus the sum of `val_b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 3 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the third pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. If the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of all elements of all pairs of integers in the list `main_ar` plus twice the sum of `val_b`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar` plus twice the sum of `val_b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
