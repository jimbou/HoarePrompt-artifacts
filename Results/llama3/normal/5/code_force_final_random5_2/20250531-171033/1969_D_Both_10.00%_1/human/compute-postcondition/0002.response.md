Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 1 pair of integers, `sub_summ` is equal to the first element of the first pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the first pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `sub_summ` has been updated to be equal to the first element of the first pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
