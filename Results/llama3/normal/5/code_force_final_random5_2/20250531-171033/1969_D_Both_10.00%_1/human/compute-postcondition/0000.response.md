Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively, `sub_summ` is 0**

In this output state, the lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The variable `sub_summ` is initialized to 0, which is its new value. The rest of the variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
