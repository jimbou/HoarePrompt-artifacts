Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally. The program is missing the key step of sorting the items based on the difference between Bob's price and Alice's price, and then selecting the items that maximize Alice's profit.

In the given code, the function `func_3` is supposed to calculate the profit, but it does not correctly implement the logic. It simply calculates the sum of all Bob's prices and adds it to the sum of all Alice's prices, which is not the correct approach.

A correct implementation would involve sorting the items based on the difference between Bob's price and Alice's price, and then selecting the top `k` items that maximize Alice's profit. The program does not do this, and therefore, it is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:

```
1
3 2
1 2 3
3 2 1
```

The correct output should be 2, but the program will output a different value because it does not correctly implement the logic.
