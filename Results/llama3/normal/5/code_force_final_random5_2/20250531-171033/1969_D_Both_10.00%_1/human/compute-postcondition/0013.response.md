The only variable in the loop head is variable  `val_b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `val_b`. If `val_b` is not the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `val_b` is the first pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `val_b` is the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar` and `val_a` is still the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. Also, `main_ar` must have at least 2 pairs of integers.
State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `sec_arr` is an empty list, `val_a` is the last pair of integers in the list `main_ar`, `val_b` is the second pair of integers in the list `main_ar`. If the sum of the elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of all elements of all pairs of integers in the list `main_ar`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first elements of all pairs of integers in the initial list `main_ar`.**
