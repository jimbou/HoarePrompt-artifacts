Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of pairs of integers, `sec_arr` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs of integers, `sub_summ` is equal to the first element of the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr` plus the first element of the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `sub_summ` has been updated by adding the first element of the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr` to its original value, which was equal to the first element of the second pair of integers in the list `sec_arr`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
