The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is between 1 and 1000, `t` becomes an integer between 1 and 1000. The second line assigns the string 'YES' to `l`. No other variables are affected. The value of `t` is used to determine the number of test cases, but the test cases themselves are not executed in this code snippet. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are not assigned any values in this code snippet. Stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, l is 'YES', stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
