To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is initialized to `n+1` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `l` are not directly related to the loop execution, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+1`, `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise 'NO', `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases**
