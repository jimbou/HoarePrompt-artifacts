Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the following case:

Input:

    1
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    ab

Output:

    NO

Expected Output:

    YES

Explanation:

The program does not correctly handle the case where the strings a and b have different characters at the same position, but the string c has a different character at that position. In this case, the program should return 'YES' because there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. However, the program returns 'NO' because it only checks if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] for all i, but it does not consider the case where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] is different from both a[i] and b[i]. 

The correct program should check for all three conditions: a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], or a[i] != b[i] and c[i] is different from both a[i] and b[i]. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        l = 'NO'
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
                break
            elif a[i] != b[i] and c[i] not in (a[i], b[i]):
                l = 'YES'
                break
        print(l)
```
