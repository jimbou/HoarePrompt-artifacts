Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is 2, `l` is 'YES', stdin contains `t-8` test cases.**

In this output state, a new variable `l` is introduced and assigned the value 'YES'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-8` test cases.
