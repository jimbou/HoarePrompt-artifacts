The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `t` is greater than `n+1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n+2`. Also, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, so stdin contains `t-5` test cases.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is `n+1`, stdin contains `t-5` test cases.**
