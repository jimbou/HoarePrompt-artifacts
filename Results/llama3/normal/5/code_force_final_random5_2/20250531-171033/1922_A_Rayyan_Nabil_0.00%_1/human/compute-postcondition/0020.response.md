Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+1`, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases.**

The value of `l` is updated to 'YES' because the current value of `i` is such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
