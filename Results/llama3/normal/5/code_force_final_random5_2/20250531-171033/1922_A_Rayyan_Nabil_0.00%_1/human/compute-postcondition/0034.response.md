Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-8` test cases. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**
