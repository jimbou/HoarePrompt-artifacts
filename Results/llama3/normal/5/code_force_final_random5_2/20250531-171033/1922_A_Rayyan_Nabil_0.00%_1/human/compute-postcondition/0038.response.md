Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is 1, `l` is 'YES', stdin contains `t-8` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to 'YES' as per the given condition. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The condition for `l` being 'YES' is still valid, which means the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.
