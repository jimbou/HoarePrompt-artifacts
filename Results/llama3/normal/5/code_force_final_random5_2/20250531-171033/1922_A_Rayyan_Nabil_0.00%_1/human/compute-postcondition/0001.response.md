To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, we can adjust the state to ensure `t` is at least 1.

Additionally, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it starts from 0, as the loop iterates from 0 to `t-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0**
