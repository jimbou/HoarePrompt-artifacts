The code snippet reads four lines of input from stdin: an integer `n`, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state has `t` as an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` as 'YES', stdin containing `t-1` test cases, and `i` as 0.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

*   `n` is an integer read from stdin.
*   `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings read from stdin.
*   `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000.
*   `l` remains 'YES'.
*   `i` remains 0.
*   stdin contains `t-2` test cases.

Output State: **n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, l is 'YES', i is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
