Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is 0, `l` is 'YES', stdin contains `t-8` test cases. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. A new variable `l` is introduced and assigned the string value 'YES'. The stdin still contains `t-8` test cases. The conditions that the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` are still valid.
