Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, l is 'YES' if there exists at least one i where a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], otherwise 'NO', stdin is empty, and 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether there exists at least one i where a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i].**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of t remains unchanged, the value of l is determined based on the condition that there exists at least one i where a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], and the standard input is empty because all test cases have been processed. The output is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the condition mentioned above.
