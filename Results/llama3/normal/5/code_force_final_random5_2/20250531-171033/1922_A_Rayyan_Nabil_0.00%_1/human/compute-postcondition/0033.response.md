To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to `n+1`, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range of `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-8` test cases**
