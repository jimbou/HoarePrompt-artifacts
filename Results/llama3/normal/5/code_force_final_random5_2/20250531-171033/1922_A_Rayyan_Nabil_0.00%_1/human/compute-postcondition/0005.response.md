Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**

The code simply assigns the value 'YES' to the variable `l`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases. The conditions regarding the current values of `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` are still valid.
