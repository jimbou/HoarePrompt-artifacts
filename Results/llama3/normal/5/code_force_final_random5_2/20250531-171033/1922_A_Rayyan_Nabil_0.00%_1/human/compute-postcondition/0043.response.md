Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-8` test cases. If there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the value of `l` will be 'YES' if and only if there exists at least one index `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If no such index exists, then `l` will be 'NO'. The other variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
