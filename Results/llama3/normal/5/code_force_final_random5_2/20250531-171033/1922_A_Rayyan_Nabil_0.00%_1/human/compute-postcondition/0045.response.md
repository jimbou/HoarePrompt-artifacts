The code prints the value of `l` which is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. The value of `l` is determined by the comparison of strings `a`, `b`, and `c` at index `i`, where `i` is equal to `n`. If such an `i` exists, `l` is 'YES', otherwise, it is 'NO'.
Output: ** `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+2`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-8` test cases, and 'YES' is printed if there exists at least one `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise 'NO' is printed**
