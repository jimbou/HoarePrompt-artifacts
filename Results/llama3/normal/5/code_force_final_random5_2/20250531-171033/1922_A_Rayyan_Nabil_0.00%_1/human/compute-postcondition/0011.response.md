Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**

The value of `l` is updated to 'YES'. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the program continues to execute, is not affected by this code snippet. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
