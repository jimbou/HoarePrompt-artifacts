Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+1`, `i` is 2, `l` is 'YES', stdin contains `t-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been changed to 'YES'. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are still strings, `t` is still an integer greater than `n+1`, and `i` is still 2. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
