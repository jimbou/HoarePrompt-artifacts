The code prints the value of `l`, which is determined by the condition that checks if there exists at least one index `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.

If such an index `i` exists, then `l` is 'YES', indicating that there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`.

If no such index `i` exists, then `l` is 'NO', indicating that for all positions, either `a` or `b` (or both) are equal to `c`.

Output: **YES if there exists at least one i where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise NO**
