The code prints the value of `l`, which is 'YES' if there exists at least one `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise 'NO'. This value is determined based on the comparison of strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **'YES' if there exists at least one i where a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], otherwise 'NO'**
