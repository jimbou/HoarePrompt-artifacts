The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `n+1`.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+1`, `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise 'NO', `i` is `n+1`, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, and 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether there exists at least one `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**
