Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then the program continues to execute. Otherwise, the program does not execute any additional operations.***
