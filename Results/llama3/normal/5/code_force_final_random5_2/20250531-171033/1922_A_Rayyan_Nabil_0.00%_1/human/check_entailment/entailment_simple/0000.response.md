Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists at least one position `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it sets `l` to `'YES'`, otherwise it sets `l` to `'NO'`. This is in accordance with the problem description, which requires that the strings `a` and `b` match the template `t` while the string `c` does not.

The program correctly handles the case where `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` but not equal to `c[i]`, in which case it sets `l` to `'YES'`. It also correctly handles the case where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` but both are not equal to `c[i]`, in which case it sets `l` to `'YES'`.

The program also correctly handles the case where `a[i]` is equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]` for all `i`, in which case it sets `l` to `'NO'`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
