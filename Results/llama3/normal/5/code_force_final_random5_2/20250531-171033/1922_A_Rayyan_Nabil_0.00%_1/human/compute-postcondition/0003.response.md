To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, which is the initial value for the loop variable. 

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES', `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases**
