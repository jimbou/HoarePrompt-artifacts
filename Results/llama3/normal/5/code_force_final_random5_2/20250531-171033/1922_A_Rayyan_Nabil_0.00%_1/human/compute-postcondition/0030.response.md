Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer greater than `n+1`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If there exists at least one `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'. and the value of `l` is printed which is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether there exists at least one `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`**
