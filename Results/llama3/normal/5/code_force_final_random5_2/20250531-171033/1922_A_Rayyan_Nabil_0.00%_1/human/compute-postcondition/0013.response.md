Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise 'NO', `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` as in the initial state. The value of `l` will be 'YES' if there was at least one iteration where `a[i]` was not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` was not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise it will be 'NO'. The value of `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-2` test cases.
