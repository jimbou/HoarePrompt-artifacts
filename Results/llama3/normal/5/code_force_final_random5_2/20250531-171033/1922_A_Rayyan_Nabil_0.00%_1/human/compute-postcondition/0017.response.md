Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, t is an integer greater than n+1, l is 'YES' if there exists at least one i where a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], otherwise 'NO', i is n+1, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

The code reads the value of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. The value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings. The value of `t` is an integer greater than `n+1`, and `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, otherwise 'NO'. The value of `i` is `n+1`. After the code executes, the value of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, `l`, and `i` are updated, and `t-4` test cases are left in the input.
