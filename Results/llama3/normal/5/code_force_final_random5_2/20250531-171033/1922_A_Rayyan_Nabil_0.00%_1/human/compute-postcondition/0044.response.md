The code prints the value of `l`, which is determined by the existence of at least one index `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If such an index exists, `l` is 'YES', otherwise, it is 'NO'.

Output: **YES if there exists at least one i such that a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], otherwise NO**
