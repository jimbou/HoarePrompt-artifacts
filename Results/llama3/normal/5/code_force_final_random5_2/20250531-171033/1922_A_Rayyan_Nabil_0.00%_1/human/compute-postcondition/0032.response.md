Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, t is an integer greater than n+2, i is n+1, stdin contains t-8 test cases.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was greater than or equal to 0, it remains so. The second, third, and fourth lines assign string values to `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. These variables were already strings, so their types remain unchanged. The values of `t` and `i` are not affected by the code snippet. Stdin initially contained `t-5` test cases, but since four lines of input were consumed, it now contains `t-8` test cases.
