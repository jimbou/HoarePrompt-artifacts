Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The program iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c. If it finds a position where the characters in a and b are different from the character in c, it sets the variable l to 'YES'. If it doesn't find such a position after checking all characters, it sets l to 'NO'. Finally, it prints the value of l.

This logic is correct because it checks the condition specified in the problem statement: if the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i, and if the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

Correctness: **True**
