Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k < (1 << k.bit_length() - 1), `nums` is a list of n integers. If `k` is larger than 0, `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, `nums[1]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k), `nums[2]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + 1, k), ..., `nums[n-1]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + n - 1, k), and all other elements are 0, `i` is n. If `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of n integers where `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is n.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of integers 'nums' with 'n' elements. If 'k' is larger than 0, the first 'n' elements of 'nums' are min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + i, k) for i from 0 to n-1, and all other elements are 0. If 'k' is 0, 'nums[0]' is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of integers based on the input parameters `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where the first `n` elements are determined by the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the elements of `nums` are calculated as the minimum of `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + i` and `k` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. If `k` is 0, the first element of `nums` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0. The function effectively distributes the value of `k` across the first `n` elements of the list, capping each element at a maximum value determined by `k`.
