Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k < (1 << k.bit_length() - 1), `nums` is a list of n integers. If `k` is larger than 0, `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k, `nums[1]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k), `nums[2]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + 1, k), ..., `nums[n-1]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + n - 1, k), and all other elements are 0, `i` is n. If `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of n integers where `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `nums[0]` has been increased by `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `k` is larger than 0, the first element of `nums` is now the sum of the original value and `k`, while the rest of the elements remain the same. If `k` is 0, the first element of `nums` remains the same. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are unchanged.
