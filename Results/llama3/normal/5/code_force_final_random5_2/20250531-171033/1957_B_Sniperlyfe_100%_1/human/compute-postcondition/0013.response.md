Output State: **The program returns a list of integers 'nums' with 'n' elements. If 'k' is larger than 0, the first 'n' elements of 'nums' are min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + i, k) for i from 0 to n-1, and all other elements are 0. If 'k' is 0, 'nums[0]' is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 0.**
