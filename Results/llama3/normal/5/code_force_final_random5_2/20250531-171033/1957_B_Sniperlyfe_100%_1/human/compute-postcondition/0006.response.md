Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k < (1 << k.bit_length() - 1), nums is a list of n integers where nums[0] is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, nums[1] is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k), nums[2] is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + 1, k), and all other elements are 0, i is 2.**
