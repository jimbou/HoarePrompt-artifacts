Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k < (1 << k.bit_length() - 1), `nums` is a list of n integers. If `k` is larger than 0, `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, `nums[1]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k), `nums[2]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + 1, k), ..., `nums[n-1]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + n - 1, k), and all other elements are 0, `i` is n. If `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of n integers where `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).
*   The value of `k` remains unchanged, which is an integer between 0 and (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) (exclusive).
*   The list `nums` contains `n` integers. If `k` is greater than 0, the first element `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, and the subsequent elements `nums[1]`, `nums[2]`, ..., `nums[n-1]` are the minimum of (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + i and k, where i is the index of the element. If `k` is 0, the first element `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, and all other elements are 0.
*   The value of `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
