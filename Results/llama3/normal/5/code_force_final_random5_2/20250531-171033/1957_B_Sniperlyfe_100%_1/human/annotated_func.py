#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k < (1 << k.bit_length() - 1), `nums` is a list of n integers. If `k` is larger than 0, `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, `nums[1]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k), `nums[2]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + 1, k), ..., `nums[n-1]` is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + n - 1, k), and all other elements are 0, `i` is n. If `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of n integers where `nums[0]` is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is n.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of integers 'nums' with 'n' elements. If 'k' is larger than 0, the first 'n' elements of 'nums' are min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + i, k) for i from 0 to n-1, and all other elements are 0. If 'k' is 0, 'nums[0]' is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of integers based on the input parameters `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where the first `n` elements are determined by the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the elements of `nums` are calculated as the minimum of `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + i` and `k` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. If `k` is 0, the first element of `nums` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0. The function effectively distributes the value of `k` across the first `n` elements of the list, capping each element at a maximum value determined by `k`.
