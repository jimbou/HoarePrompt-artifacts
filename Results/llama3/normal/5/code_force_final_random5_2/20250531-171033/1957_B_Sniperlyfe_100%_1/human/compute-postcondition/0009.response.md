Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k < (1 << k.bit_length() - 1), nums is a list of n integers where nums[0] is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, nums[1] is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k), nums[2] is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + 1, k), nums[3] is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) + 1, k), and all other elements are 0, i is 3.**

The code first assigns the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k` to `nums[i]`. Since `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `nums[i]` becomes `min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k)`. The second line subtracts the value of `nums[i]` from `k`, making `k` equal to `k - min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1), k)`. No other variables are affected.
