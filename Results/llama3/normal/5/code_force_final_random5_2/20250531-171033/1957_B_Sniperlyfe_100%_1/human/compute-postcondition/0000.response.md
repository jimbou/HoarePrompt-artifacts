Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k < (1 << k.bit_length() - 1), nums is a list of n integers where nums[0] is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` is reduced by the value of `nums[0]`, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This means that `k` is now less than its original value, but still a non-negative integer. The list `nums` is initialized with `n` zeros, and then the first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. All other elements of `nums` remain 0.
