Based on the precondition, the value of `cnt1` is 1, which means the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character. Since `cnt1` is not divisible by 2 (1 is not divisible by 2), the condition "cnt1 is not divisible by 2" is true.

The print statement simply prints the string 'NO'. There are no variables or expressions being evaluated or printed, so the output is a fixed string.

Output: **NO**
