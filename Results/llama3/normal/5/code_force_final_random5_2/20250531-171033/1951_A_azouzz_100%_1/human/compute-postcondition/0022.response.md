Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Either cnt1 is less than or equal to 2 or cnt1 is not divisible by 2. If cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is not 1 but less than or equal to 2, 'YES' is printed if the string s does not contain the substring '11', otherwise 'NO' is printed.***
