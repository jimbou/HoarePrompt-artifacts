This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then checks the number of '1' characters in the binary string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions: if the count is more than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count is more than 2 but not even, it prints 'NO'; if the count is 1 or the string contains '11', it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
