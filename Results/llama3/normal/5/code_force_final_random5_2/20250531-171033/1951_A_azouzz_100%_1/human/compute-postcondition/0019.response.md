Based on the initial state, the code will print 'YES' because the conditions for cnt1 are met, which are cnt1 is less than or equal to 2 and cnt1 is not equal to 1. Since cnt1 is the number of '1' characters in the string s, and the string s does not contain the substring '11', cnt1 can only be 0 or 2. Therefore, the print statement will execute and print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
