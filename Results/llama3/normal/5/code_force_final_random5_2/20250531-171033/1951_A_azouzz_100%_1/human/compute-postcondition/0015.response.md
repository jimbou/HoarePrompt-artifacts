Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a string, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Either cnt1 is less than or equal to 2 or cnt1 is not divisible by 2. cnt1 is less than or equal to 2 and cnt1 is not equal to 1. The current value of cnt1 is greater than 1 since '11' is in s, indicating that there are at least two consecutive '1' characters in s.**
