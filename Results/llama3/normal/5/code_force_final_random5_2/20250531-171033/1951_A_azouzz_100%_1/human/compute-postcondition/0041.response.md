To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same.

The other variables, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999, t is at least 2, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the last test case, s is a string equal to the last input string, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1' characters in s, stdin contains no input.**
