The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, q must be decreased by 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where a[i] is the sum of all integers from a[0] to a[i] for all i from 0 to n, b is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where b[i] is b[i - 1] plus 1 if a[i] > 1 else b[i - 1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.**
