Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, q is an integer, a is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, b is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where b[1] is 1 if a[1] > 1 else 2, b[2] is b[1] plus 1 if a[2] > 1 else b[1] plus 2, i is 2, stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.**

The code assigns the value of 1 to `x` if `a[i]` is greater than 1; otherwise, it assigns the value of 2 to `x`. Then, it assigns the value of `b[i - 1] + x` to `b[i]`. Since `i` is 2, this operation affects the value of `b[2]`. The value of `b[2]` becomes `b[1] + x`, where `x` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `a[2]`. The value of `b[1]` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `a[1]`. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged.
