Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where a[i] is the sum of all integers from a[0] to a[i] for all i from 0 to n, b is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where b[i] is b[i - 1] plus 1 if a[i] > 1 else b[i - 1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.**

The code snippet reads two integers x and y from the input, then checks if the sum of the subarray from a[x - 1] to a[y] is less than the sum of the subarray from b[x - 1] to b[y]. If this condition is true or if x is equal to y, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The values of n, q, a, b, and i remain unchanged. The stdin contains one or more test cases, each containing three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers.
