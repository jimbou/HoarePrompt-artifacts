Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer, a is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where a[i] is the sum of all integers from a[0] to a[i] for all i from 0 to n, b is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where b[i] is b[i - 1] plus 1 if a[i] > 1 else b[i - 1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES'
        )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where a[i] is the sum of all integers from a[0] to a[i] for all i from 0 to n, b is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where b[i] is b[i - 1] plus 1 if a[i] > 1 else b[i - 1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where a[i] is the sum of all integers from a[0] to a[i] for all i from 0 to n, b is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where b[i] is b[i - 1] plus 1 if a[i] > 1 else b[i - 1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where a[i] is the sum of all integers from a[0] to a[i] for all i from 0 to n, b is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where b[i] is b[i - 1] plus 1 if a[i] > 1 else b[i - 1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
