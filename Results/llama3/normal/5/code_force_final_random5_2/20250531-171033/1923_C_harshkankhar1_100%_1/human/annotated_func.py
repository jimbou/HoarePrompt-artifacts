#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer, a is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, b is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, where b[i] is b[i - 1] plus 1 if a[i] > 1 else b[i - 1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains one or more test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an array and a number of queries. For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to a calculated value, and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. The function iterates through all queries in each test case, and then moves on to the next test case.
