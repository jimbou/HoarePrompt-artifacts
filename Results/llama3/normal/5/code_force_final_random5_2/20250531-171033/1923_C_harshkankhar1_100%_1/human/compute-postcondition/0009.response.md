To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is at least 1. Since `q` is an integer, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1`, where `a[i]` is the sum of all integers from `a[0]` to `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`, `b` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1`, where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1]` plus 1 if `a[i]` > 1 else `b[i - 1]` plus 2 for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array `c`. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.**
