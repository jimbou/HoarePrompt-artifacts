This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an array and a number of queries. For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to a calculated value, and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. The function iterates through all queries in each test case, and then moves on to the next test case.
