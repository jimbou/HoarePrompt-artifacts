Output State: **n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of integers with a length of n + 1, b is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and finally two or more space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the array and the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is the array c. The last input of each test case is the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers representing the borders of the subarray.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first two inputs to `n` and `q`, respectively. The second line assigns a list of integers from the third input to `a`, with an additional element 0 at the beginning. The third line assigns a list of zeros to `b`, with a length of `n + 1`. The remaining inputs in stdin are unchanged.
