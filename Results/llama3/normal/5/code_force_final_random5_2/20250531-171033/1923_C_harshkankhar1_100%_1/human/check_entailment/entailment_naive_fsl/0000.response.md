Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `a` and the cumulative sum of the array `b`, where `b[i]` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1 and 2 otherwise. This is done to ensure that the sum of the elements in the subarray `b` is greater than the sum of the elements in the subarray `a`.

The program then checks for each query whether the sum of the elements in the subarray `a` from index `x` to `y` is less than the sum of the elements in the subarray `b` from index `x` to `y`. If this condition is met, it means that the subarray `a` from index `x` to `y` can be transformed into a subarray `b` that meets the conditions, and therefore the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program also correctly handles the case where `x` is equal to `y`, in which case the subarray has only one element and cannot be transformed into a subarray `b` that meets the conditions.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
