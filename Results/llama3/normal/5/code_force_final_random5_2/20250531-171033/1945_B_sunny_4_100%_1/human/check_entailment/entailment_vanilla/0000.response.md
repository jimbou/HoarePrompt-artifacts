Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), and then adding 2.

However, the program has a logical error. The correct calculation should be to divide the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), and then add 1 for each installation, not 2.

The correct calculation is:

A = m // a + 1
B = m // b + 1
ans = A + B

The program incorrectly adds 2 to the result, which would overcount the number of fireworks.

Correctness: **False**
