Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), qi is 0, a, b, m are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), ans is an integer equal to m // a + m // b + 2**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three integers a, b, and m. These values are assigned to the variables a, b, and m, respectively. The variable ans is then calculated as the sum of the integer divisions of m by a and b, plus 2. The value of qi remains unchanged at 0. The number of lines in stdin decreases by 1.
