Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), qi is 2, a, b, m are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), ans is an integer equal to m // a + m // b + 2**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three integers a, b, and m. These values are assigned to the variables a, b, and m, respectively. The value of ans is then calculated as m // a + m // b + 2, where // denotes integer division. The value of t is not affected by the code, and qi remains unchanged. The state of stdin is updated to contain t-4 lines, as one line has been read.
