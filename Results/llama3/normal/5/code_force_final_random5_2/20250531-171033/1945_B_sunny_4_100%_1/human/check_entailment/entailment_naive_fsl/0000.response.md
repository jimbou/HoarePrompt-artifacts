Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the line where the answer is calculated: `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`. The addition of 2 is incorrect, as it assumes that there will always be at least two fireworks visible in the sky at the same time, which is not necessarily true.

A counterexample is when `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `m = 1`. In this case, the program will output `4`, but the correct answer is `2`, because only two fireworks can be visible in the sky at the same time.

The correct calculation should be `ans = m // a + m // b`, without the addition of 2. This will correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.
