Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

Explanation: The code reads an integer t from stdin, which can be any value between 1 and 10^4. After reading t, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m, where each of these integers is between 1 and 10^18. The code does not modify the values of a, b, or m, so they remain the same as in the initial state. The variable t is assigned the value read from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
