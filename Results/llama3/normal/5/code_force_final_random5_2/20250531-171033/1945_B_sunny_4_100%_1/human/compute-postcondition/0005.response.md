To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head `for qi in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `qi`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `qi` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `qi` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `qi` should be 1.

The other variables `t`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `m` (1 <= `a`, `b`, `m` <= 10^18), `qi` is 1, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= `a`, `b`, `m` <= 10^18), `ans` is an integer equal to `m // a + m // b + 2**
