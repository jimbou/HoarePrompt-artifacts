Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), qi is 1, a, b, m are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), ans is an integer equal to m // a + m // b + 2**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of lines in `stdin` decreases by 1, as one line is read and processed. The values of `qi`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated based on the input read from `stdin`. The value of `ans` is calculated using the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
