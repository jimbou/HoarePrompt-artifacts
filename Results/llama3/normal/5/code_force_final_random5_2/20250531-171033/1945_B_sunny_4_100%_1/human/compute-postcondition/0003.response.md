The code prints the value of `ans`, which is an integer equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`. 

Since `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^18, the value of `ans` will be the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `b`, plus 2.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m, a, and b are integers between 1 and 10^18)**
