Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by noticing that the game is won by the player who can make the last move. This happens when the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd. The reason for this is that each move consists of two steps: swapping wallets (optional) and removing one coin. The swapping step does not change the total number of coins, but the removing step decreases the total number of coins by one. Therefore, if the total number of coins is odd, the last move will be made by the player who has the turn when the total number of coins is odd. Since Alice makes the first move, she will make the last move if the total number of coins is odd, and Bob will make the last move if the total number of coins is even.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, and printing 'Bob' if it's even and 'Alice' if it's odd.

Correctness: **True**
