State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), s is a string containing two integers a and b separated by a space, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If the sum of a and b is even, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed.**
