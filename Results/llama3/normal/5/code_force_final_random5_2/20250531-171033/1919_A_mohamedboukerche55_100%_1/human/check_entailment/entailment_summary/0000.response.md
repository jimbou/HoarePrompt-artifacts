Reasoning:

The problem states that the game is won by the player who can make the last valid move. A valid move consists of either exchanging wallets or keeping the current wallet, followed by removing 1 coin from the current wallet. The key insight here is that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, then Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins. Since Bob can always make a move that leaves Alice with an odd number of coins, Bob will always have the opportunity to make the last move and win the game.

On the other hand, if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, then Alice will always have the opportunity to make a move that leaves Bob with an odd number of coins. Since Bob cannot make a move that leaves Alice with an even number of coins, Alice will always have the opportunity to make the last move and win the game.

The given program correctly implements this logic by checking whether the sum of the coins (a + b) is even or odd and printing the corresponding winner.

Correctness: **True**
