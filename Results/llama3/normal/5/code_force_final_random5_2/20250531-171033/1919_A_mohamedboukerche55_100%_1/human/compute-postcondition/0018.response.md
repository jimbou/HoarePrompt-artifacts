Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), s is an empty string, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If the sum of a and b is even, 'Bob' was printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' was printed.**

The code first reads a line from stdin and assigns it to `s`. Since `s` initially contained two integers `a` and `b` separated by a space, `s` now becomes an empty string. The second line splits `s` into a list of strings using space as the delimiter and converts the first element to an integer, assigning it to `a`. The third line does the same for the second element, assigning it to `b`. 

Since `a` and `b` were initially integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, they remain so after the code execution. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd, and accordingly, either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and stdin now contains `t-5` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).
