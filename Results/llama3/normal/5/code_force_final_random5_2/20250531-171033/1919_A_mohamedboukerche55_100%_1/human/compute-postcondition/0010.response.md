The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-2 lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9), s is a string containing two integers a and b separated by a space, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If the sum of a and b is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the sum of a and b is odd, 'Alice' is printed.**
