Output State: **t is at least 1, i is t-1, stdin is empty, s is an empty string, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If the sum of a and b is even, 'Bob' was printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' was printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` is still at least 1 (since it was initialized to be between 1 and 1000), the loop counter `i` has reached `t-1` (since the loop iterates `t` times), the standard input `stdin` is empty (since all input lines have been processed), the string `s` is empty (since there is no more input to read), and the variables `a` and `b` still hold the last pair of integers read from the input (with values between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). Additionally, the output will be either 'Bob' or 'Alice', depending on whether the sum of the last pair of integers `a` and `b` is even or odd, respectively.
