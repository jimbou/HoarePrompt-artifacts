Reasoning:

The problem states that the game is won by the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of two steps: choosing to exchange wallets with the opponent or keeping the current wallet, and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The key insight here is that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, then Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves Bob with the opportunity to make the last move. This is because Alice's first move will always change the parity of the total number of coins, and then Bob's move will change it back, and so on. Therefore, if the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win.

On the other hand, if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, then Alice will always have the opportunity to make the last move. This is because Alice's first move will always change the parity of the total number of coins, and then Bob's move will change it back, and so on. Therefore, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win.

The given program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of a and b and printing 'Bob' if it's even and 'Alice' if it's odd.

Correctness: **True**
