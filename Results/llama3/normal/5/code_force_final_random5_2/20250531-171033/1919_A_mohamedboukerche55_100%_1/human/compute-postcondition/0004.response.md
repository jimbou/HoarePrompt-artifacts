Based on the initial state, the code will print the string 'Bob'.

Here's the explanation:

* The initial state mentions that t is at least 1, i is 0, and stdin contains t-1 lines of input. However, this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The print statement simply prints the string 'Bob'.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Bob**
