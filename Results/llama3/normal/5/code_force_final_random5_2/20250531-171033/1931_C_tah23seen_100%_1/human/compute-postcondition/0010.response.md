According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr`. If `j` is greater than 0 and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 2, `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, and `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`. `j` being `n - 2` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is greater than 0. `arr[j]` being equal to `arr[j - 1]` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]` and `j` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, `j` is greater than 0, `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`**
