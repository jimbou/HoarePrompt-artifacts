Output State: **`arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, and `j` is 0. This means that the loop has iterated until `j` is 0, indicating that all elements in the array have been processed. The state of the other variables, `arr`, `i`, and `n`, remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
