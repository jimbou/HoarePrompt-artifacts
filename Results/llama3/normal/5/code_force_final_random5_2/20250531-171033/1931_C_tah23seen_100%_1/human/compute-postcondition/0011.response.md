The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The value of `j` was greater than 0, so after decrementing, it is still greater than or equal to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr` is still `i`. The length of `arr` is still `n`, which is at least 2. The first `i` elements of `arr` are still equal to each other. `arr` still has at least `i + 1` elements.

Output State: **`arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, `j` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]` if `j` is greater than 0**
