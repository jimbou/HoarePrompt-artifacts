Output State: **`arr` has at least two elements with the first element equal to the second, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is at least 1**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The array `arr` still has at least two elements with the first element equal to the second, `n` is still at least 2, and `j` is still at least 1.
