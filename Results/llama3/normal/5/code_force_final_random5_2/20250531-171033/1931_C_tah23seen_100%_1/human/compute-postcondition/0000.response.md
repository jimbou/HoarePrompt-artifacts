Output State: **arr is a list of integers, i is 0, n is the length of arr, j is the last index of arr**

The code initializes three variables: `i`, `n`, and `j`. The first line sets `i` to 0. The second line assigns the length of the list `arr` to `n`. The third line assigns the last index of the list `arr` to `j`. Since the length of a list in Python is the number of elements it contains, and indexing starts at 0, the last index of a list is always one less than its length. Therefore, `j` is set to `len(arr) - 1`. The list `arr` remains unchanged throughout the code execution.
