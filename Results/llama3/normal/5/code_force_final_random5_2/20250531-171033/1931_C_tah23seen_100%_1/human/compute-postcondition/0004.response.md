Output State: **`arr` has at least three elements with the first element equal to the second and the second element equal to the third, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `j` is at least 1**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged, so `arr` still has at least three elements with the first element equal to the second and the second element equal to the third, `n` is still at least 2, and `j` is still at least 1.
