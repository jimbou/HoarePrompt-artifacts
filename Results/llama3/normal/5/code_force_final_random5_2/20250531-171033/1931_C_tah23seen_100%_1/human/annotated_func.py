#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the last index of `arr`.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns 0
    #State: *`arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0. The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum value between the difference of the length of the array and the length of the longest prefix of equal elements minus 1, and the value of j.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the maximum length of a subarray that can be formed by removing elements from the beginning and end of the input array, such that the remaining elements are not equal to the first and last elements of the original array. It returns 0 if the first and last elements are equal, and otherwise returns the maximum possible length of such a subarray.
