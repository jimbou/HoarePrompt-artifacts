The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Since `j` is the last index of `arr`, the new value of `j` is `n - 2`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, `j` is `n - 2`.**
