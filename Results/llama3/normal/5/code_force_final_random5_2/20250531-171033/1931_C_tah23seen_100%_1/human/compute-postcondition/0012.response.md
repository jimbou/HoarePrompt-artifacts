According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr[j]`. If `j` is greater than 0 and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]` if `j` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be greater than 0 and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, `j` is greater than 0, `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`**
