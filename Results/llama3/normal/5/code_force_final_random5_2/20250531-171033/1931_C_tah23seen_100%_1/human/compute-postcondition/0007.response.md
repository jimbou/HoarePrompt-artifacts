Output State: **`arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the last index of `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in the array `arr`. The array `arr` will still have at least `i + 1` elements, and the first `i` elements will be equal to each other. The value of `n` will still be the length of `arr`, and the value of `j` will still be the last index of `arr`.
