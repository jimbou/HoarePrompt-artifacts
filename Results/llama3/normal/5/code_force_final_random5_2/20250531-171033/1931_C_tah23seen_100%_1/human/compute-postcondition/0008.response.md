To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

1. **Condition `j > 0`**: Since `j` is the last index of `arr`, for `j` to be greater than 0, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. Given that `arr` already has at least `i + 1` elements, this condition is inherently satisfied if `i` is at least 1. However, we need to ensure that `j` (the last index) is indeed greater than 0, which means `n` (the length of `arr`) must be at least 2.

2. **Condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**: For this condition to be true, the last element of `arr` must be equal to the second last element. Given that the first `i` elements are equal and `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements, if `i` is equal to `n` (meaning all elements in `arr` are equal), this condition is automatically satisfied. However, if `i` is less than `n`, we specifically need the last two elements to be equal for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the adjustments needed are:

- `n` must be at least 2 to ensure `j > 0`.
- Since `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements and we need `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`, if `i` is less than `n`, we need to ensure the last two elements are equal. However, since we cannot adjust the state of `arr` beyond what's specified, and we know the first `i` elements are equal, the critical adjustment is ensuring `n` is at least 2, which is implicitly satisfied by the condition that `arr` has at least `i + 1` elements and `i` being the length of the longest prefix of equal elements.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop can execute at least once is:

State: **`arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, `j` is the last index of `arr`**
