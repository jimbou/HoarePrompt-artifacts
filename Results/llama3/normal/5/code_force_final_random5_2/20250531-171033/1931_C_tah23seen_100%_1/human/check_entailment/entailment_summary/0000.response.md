Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of burles (or operations) required to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function `func_1` works by first finding the longest prefix and suffix of the array that have the same element. It then checks if the first and last elements of the array are equal. If they are equal, it returns the maximum length of the subarray that can be formed by removing elements from the beginning and end of the array, such that the remaining elements are not equal to the first and last elements of the original array. If the first and last elements are not equal, it returns the maximum possible length of such a subarray.

The program then reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements. It calls the `func_1` function with the array as input and prints the result.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The function `func_1` only considers the longest prefix and suffix of the array that have the same element, but it does not consider other possible subarrays that could be formed by removing elements from the beginning and end of the array.

For example, consider the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function `func_1` would return `4`, but the correct answer is `5` because we can make all elements equal by assigning the value `1` to all elements in the subarray `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and needs to be revised to correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.
