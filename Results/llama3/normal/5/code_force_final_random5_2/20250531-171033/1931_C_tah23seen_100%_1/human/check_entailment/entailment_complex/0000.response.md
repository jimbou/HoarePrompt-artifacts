Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" (operations) needed to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function first finds the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in the array (`i`) and the length of the longest suffix of equal elements in the array (`j`). It then checks if the first and last elements of the array are equal. If they are, it returns 0, indicating that no operations are needed.

If the first and last elements are not equal, the function returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum value between the difference of the length of the array and the length of the longest prefix of equal elements minus 1 (`n - i - 1`), and the value of `j`. This value represents the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The function correctly handles the cases where the first and last elements are equal and where they are not equal. The use of `max` and `min` functions ensures that the returned value is always non-negative and represents the minimum number of burles required.

Correctness: **True**
