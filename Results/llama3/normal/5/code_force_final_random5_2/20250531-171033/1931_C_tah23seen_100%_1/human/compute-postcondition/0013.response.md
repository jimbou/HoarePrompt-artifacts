Output State: **`arr` has at least `i + 1` elements with the first `i` elements equal to each other, `i` is the length of the longest prefix of equal elements in `arr`, `n` is at least 2 and is the length of `arr`, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to 1 because it was greater than 0 initially. The other variables remain unchanged. The first `i` elements of `arr` are still equal to each other, and `n` is still the length of `arr`. The relationship between `arr[j]` and `arr[j - 1]` is still maintained, but now `j` is one less than its original value.
