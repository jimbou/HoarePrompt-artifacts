Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum value between the difference of the length of the array and the length of the longest prefix of equal elements minus 1, and the value of j.**

In this case, since `j` is 0, the minimum value between `n - i - 1` and `j` will be 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.
