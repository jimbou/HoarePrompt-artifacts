According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object `open(0)`. If the file object has at least 2 lines, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed  the file object must have at least 2 lines and s is the second line.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, s is the second line**
