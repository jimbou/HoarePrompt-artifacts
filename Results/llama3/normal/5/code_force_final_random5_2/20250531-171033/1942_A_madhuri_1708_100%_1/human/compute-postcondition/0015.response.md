Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object `open(0)` must have at least 1 line.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values read from the input. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, as the first line has been read and its values assigned to `n` and `k`. The file object `open(0)` still has at least 1 line, as the first line has been read but there are still t-1 lines left.
