Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program attempts to solve this problem by considering two cases:

1. `k >= 2`: In this case, the program checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints an array of `k` elements, all equal to `k`. If `n != k`, it prints `-1`.
2. `k < 2`: In this case, the program prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is one more than its index (i.e., `[1, 2, ..., n]`).

Let's analyze the correctness of the program:

Case 1: `k >= 2`

* If `n == k`, the program prints an array of `k` elements, all equal to `k`. This array has `k` sorted cyclic shifts, which is correct.
* If `n != k`, the program prints `-1`. This is also correct, because if `k >= 2` and `n != k`, there is no array that satisfies the condition.

Case 2: `k < 2`

* The program prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is one more than its index. This array has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself), which is correct for `k == 1`. However, for `k == 0`, this array does not satisfy the condition, and the program should print `-1` instead.

Therefore, the program is almost correct, but it has a small mistake in the case where `k < 2`. It should print `-1` for `k == 0`, instead of printing an array.

Correctness: **False**
