Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k. For each test case, if k is greater than or equal to 2, it prints a list of k integers if n equals k, otherwise it prints -1. If k is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 1 to n. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, exhausting the input file object.**
