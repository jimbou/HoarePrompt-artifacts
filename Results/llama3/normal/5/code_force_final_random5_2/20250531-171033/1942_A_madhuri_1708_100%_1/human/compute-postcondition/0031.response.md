The code prints a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3. The value of `n` is assigned from the second line of the file object `open(0)`, which contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3).

Output: **[1, 2, 3, ..., n] (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
