The only objects in the loop head are variables  s and file object `open(0)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object `open(0)`.  If the file object `open(0)` has at least 2 lines the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, the file object `open(0)` has at least 1 line, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed one more time the file object `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines and s is the second line.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, s is the second line**
