Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the file object `open(0)` is exhausted. The values of `n` and `k` are no longer accessible. The output is a series of lines, each containing either a list of integers or -1, as determined by the conditions in the loop body.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the file object `open(0)` has been fully read. The variables `n` and `k` are no longer defined, as they were only scoped within the loop. The output of the program is a collection of lines, where each line contains either a list of numbers (if `k` was 1) or a single value (-1, if `k` was 2 or more and `n` was not equal to `k`) or a list of `k` repeated `k` times (if `k` was 2 or more and `n` was equal to `k`).
