Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object `open(0)` must have at least 1 line.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the second line of the input, which contains two integers separated by a space. The value of `n` is assigned the first integer, and the value of `k` is assigned the second integer. The stdin still contains the remaining input lines, but the number of lines is reduced by 1 since the second line has been read. The file object `open(0)` still has at least 1 line, as the first line has not been read yet.
