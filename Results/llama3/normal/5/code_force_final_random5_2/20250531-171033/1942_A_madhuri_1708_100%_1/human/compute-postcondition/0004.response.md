The code prints a list of `k` elements, where each element is equal to `k`. Since the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, the list will contain `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, and the value of `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, but the current value of `k` is 2 or more.

Output: **[n, n, ..., n] (where n is the current value of n, and the list contains n elements)**
