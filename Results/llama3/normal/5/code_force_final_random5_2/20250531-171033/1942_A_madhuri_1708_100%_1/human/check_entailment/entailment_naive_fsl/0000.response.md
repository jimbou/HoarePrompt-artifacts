Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = 1 and n > 1. In this case, the program prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, but this sequence does not satisfy the condition that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints "1 2 3", but this sequence has 3 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], and [3, 1, 2]. However, the problem requires that exactly 1 cyclic shift is sorted.

To fix this, the program should print a sequence that has exactly 1 sorted cyclic shift when k = 1. One possible solution is to print a sequence that has a large number in the middle, such as "1 1000000 1". This sequence has only 1 sorted cyclic shift: [1, 1000000, 1].
