Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the second line of the file object `open(0)`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the file object `open(0)` must have at least 1 line.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the two integers from the second line of the file object `open(0)`, which are between 1 and 10^3. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k, and the file object `open(0)` must have at least 1 line.
