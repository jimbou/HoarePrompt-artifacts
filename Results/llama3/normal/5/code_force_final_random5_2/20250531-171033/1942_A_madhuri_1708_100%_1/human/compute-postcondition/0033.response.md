Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^3, assigned from the second line of the file object `open(0)`, with `k` being between 1 and `n`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, a list of `k` elements all equal to `k` is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is being printed.***
