Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program iterates over each test case, reading the values of n and k from the input.

If k is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if n equals k. If they are equal, it prints a list of k integers, which satisfies the condition of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. If n is not equal to k, it prints -1, indicating that no such array exists.

If k is less than 2, the program prints a list of integers from 1 to n. This is because when k is 1, the array can be constructed by having the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end, with the remaining elements in increasing order. This ensures that only one cyclic shift is sorted.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
