Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the strings a and b are identical, but the string c is different from a and b. In this case, the program will print 'NO' because it checks if c is equal to a or b, but it does not consider the case where a and b are identical but c is different.

For example, if the input is:

3
aa
aa
ab

The program will print 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because there exists a template 'A' that matches strings a and b, but not string c.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to check if a and b are identical, and if so, check if c is different from a and b. If c is different, then print 'YES', otherwise print 'NO'.
