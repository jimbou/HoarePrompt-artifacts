Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. 

The program first checks if string c is equal to either string a or string b. If it is, then there cannot exist a template t that matches a and b but not c, so it prints 'NO'. 

If c is not equal to a or b, then the program checks each character in c. If a character in c is not equal to the corresponding character in a and not equal to the corresponding character in b, then there exists a template t that matches a and b but not c (by making the character in t uppercase), so it prints 'YES'. 

If the program checks all characters in c and does not find any that are not equal to the corresponding characters in a and b, then there does not exist a template t that matches a and b but not c, so it prints 'NO'. 

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
