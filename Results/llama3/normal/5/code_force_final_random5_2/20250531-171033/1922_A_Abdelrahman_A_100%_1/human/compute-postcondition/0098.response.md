Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-8 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character in the string `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, if `x` is not in `a[counter-1]` and `x` is not in `b[counter-1]`, then `no` is False, 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
