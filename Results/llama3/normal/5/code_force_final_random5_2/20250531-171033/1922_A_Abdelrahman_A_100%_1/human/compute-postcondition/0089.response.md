Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-8 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 2 characters, `x` is the second character in the string `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, `no` is False, 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains t-8 test cases, and the other variables maintain their initial values and conditions.
