This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines whether a given string c can be formed by taking characters from strings a and b without using any character more than once. It prints 'YES' if c can be formed, 'NO' otherwise. The function iterates through each test case, checking if c is equal to a or b, and if not, it checks if each character in c is present in the corresponding position in a or b. If any character in c cannot be formed, it prints 'YES' and moves on to the next test case. If all characters in c can be formed, it prints 'NO'.
