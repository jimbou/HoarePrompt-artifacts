Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character in the string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False, `counter` is increased by 1, 'YES' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
