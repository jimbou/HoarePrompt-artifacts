Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 1 character, `no` is False, the current value of `x` is the first character in the string `c`, and the current value of `counter` is 0. Additionally, the first character `x` of string `c` is not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `no` has been changed to False. The values of the other variables remain the same. The number of test cases, the current test case number, the length of the strings, the strings themselves, the first character of string `c`, and the counter all remain unchanged. The first character `x` of string `c` is still not present in the character at index `counter` of string `a` and also not present in the character at index `counter` of string `b`.
