Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `no` is `False`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 2 characters and is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `x` is the third character in the string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `counter` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is still the same, but the value of `counter` has been updated.
