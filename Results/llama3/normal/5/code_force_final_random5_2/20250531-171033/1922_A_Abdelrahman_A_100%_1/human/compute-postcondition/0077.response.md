The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and string c, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string c. If the string c has at least 1 character the loop executes. Before the loop starts, x is the last character in the string c, so for the loop to be executed  the string c must have at least 1 character and x is the first character in the string c.
