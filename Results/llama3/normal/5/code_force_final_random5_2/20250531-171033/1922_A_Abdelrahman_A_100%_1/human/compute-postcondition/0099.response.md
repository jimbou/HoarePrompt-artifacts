Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-8 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `x` is the last character in the string `c`, `counter` is equal to `slength`, `no` is either True or False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has gone through all the characters in the string `c`. The value of `counter` is now equal to the length of the string `c` (`slength`). The value of `x` is the last character in the string `c`. The value of `no` is either True or False, depending on whether any character in `c` was not found in the corresponding positions in strings `a` and `b`. If any character in `c` was not found in the corresponding positions in strings `a` and `b`, then `no` is False and 'YES' was printed. Otherwise, `no` remains True.
