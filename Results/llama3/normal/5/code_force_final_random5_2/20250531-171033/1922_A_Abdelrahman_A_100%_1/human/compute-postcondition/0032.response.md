Postcondition: ***tests is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, b is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, c is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength. If c is equal to either a or b, then no is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no is False, c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, x is the last character in the string c, and counter is slength.***
