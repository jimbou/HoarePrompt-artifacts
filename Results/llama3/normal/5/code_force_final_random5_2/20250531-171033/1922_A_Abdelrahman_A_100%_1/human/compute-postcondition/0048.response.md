Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 1 character, `no` is False, the current value of `x` is the first character in the string `c`, and the current value of `counter` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 'YES' is printed**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The values of `tests`, `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `no`, `x`, and `counter` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement, and 'YES' is printed.
