Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-8 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 1 character, `x` is the first character in the string `c`, `counter` is increased by 1, If `x` is not present in the character at index `counter-1` of strings `a` and `b`, then `no` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The program still has the same number of test cases and strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The first character of string `c` is still `x`. The value of `no` depends on whether `x` is present in the character at the previous index of strings `a` and `b`. If `x` is not present, `no` is False and we break out of the loop. Otherwise, `no` remains True.
