Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` and is equal to either `a` or `b`, and `no` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `no` has been changed to False, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The precondition that `c` is equal to either `a` or `b` is still valid, and the stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
