To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `tests`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `tests` is at least 1. Since `tests` is already an integer between 1 and 1000, we can conclude that `tests` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so we need to initialize it to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.**
