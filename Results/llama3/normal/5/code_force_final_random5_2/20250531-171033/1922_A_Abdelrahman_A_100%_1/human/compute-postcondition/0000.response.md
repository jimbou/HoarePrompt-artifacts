Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.**

In this output state, the value of `tests` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, as one test case has been read and assigned to `tests`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin, each containing an integer n followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
