Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tests is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, b is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, c is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, no is True, c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, and counter is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `no` is `False`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 1 character and is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `x` is the first character in the string `c`, and `counter` is 1. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains `True`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `no` is `False`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 2 characters and is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `x` is the second character in the string `c`, and `counter` is 2. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `no` is `False`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 2 characters and is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `x` is the third character in the string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `counter` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
