Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `no` is `False`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 2 characters and is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `x` is the second character in the string `c`, and `counter` is 2. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the counter has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The program is still in the same loop or if statement, but the counter has been updated.
