Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-8 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `no` is True, `x` is the last character in the string `c`, `counter` is 0**

In this output state, a new variable `counter` is introduced and initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, as the code only declares and initializes the `counter` variable without modifying any existing variables.
