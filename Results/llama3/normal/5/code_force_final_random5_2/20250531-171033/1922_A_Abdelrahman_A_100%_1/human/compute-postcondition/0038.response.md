Output State: **tests is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, b is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, c is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, no is True, x is the last character in the string c, and counter is slength.**

Explanation: The code reads the value of `slength` from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 20, and assigns it to the variable `slength`. Then, it reads three strings of lowercase Latin letters from stdin, each of length `slength`, and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. The variable `no` is set to `True`. The last character of the string `c` is assigned to the variable `x`, and the value of `slength` is assigned to the variable `counter`. The remaining test cases in stdin are reduced by 3.
