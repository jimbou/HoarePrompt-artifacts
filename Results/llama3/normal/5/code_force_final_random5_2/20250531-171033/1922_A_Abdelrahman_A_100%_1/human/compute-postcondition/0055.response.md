Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 2 characters, `x` is the second character in the string `c`, `no` is False, `counter` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and 'YES' has been printed.
