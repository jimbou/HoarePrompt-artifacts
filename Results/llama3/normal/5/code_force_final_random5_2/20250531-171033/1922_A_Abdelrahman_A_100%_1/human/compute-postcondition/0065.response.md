Output State: **tests is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, b is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, c is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, no is False, x is the last character in the string c, and counter is equal to the length of string c.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all characters in string c. If any character in c is not present in the corresponding positions in strings a and b, the loop breaks and 'YES' is printed, and the value of no is set to False. The counter variable is incremented for each iteration, and its final value is equal to the length of string c. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
