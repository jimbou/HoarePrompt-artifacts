Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 1 character. If the first character `x` in the string `c` is not present in the current character of strings `a` and `b` at index `counter`, then `no` is set to False, the current value of `x` is the first character in the string `c`, and the current value of `counter` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
