Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `no` is `False`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 2 characters and is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `x` is the third character in the string `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
