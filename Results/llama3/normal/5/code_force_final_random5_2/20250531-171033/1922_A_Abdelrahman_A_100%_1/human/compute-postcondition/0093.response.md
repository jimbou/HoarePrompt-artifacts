Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-8 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character in the string `c`, and `no` is False.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `no` is introduced with a value of False. The stdin still contains t-8 test cases, and all the other variables maintain their original values and properties.
