Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains t-5 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 3 characters, `x` is the third character in the string `c`, `no` is False, `counter` is increased by 1, 'YES' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `tests`, `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `no`, and `counter` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the stdin now contains t-5 test cases instead of t-4.
