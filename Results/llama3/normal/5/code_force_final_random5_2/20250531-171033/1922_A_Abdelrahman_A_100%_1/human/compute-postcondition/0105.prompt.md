Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        counter = 0
        for x in c:
            if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                no = False
                print('YES')
                break
            counter += 1
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tests is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, b is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, c is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength. If c is equal to either a or b, then no is True, 'NO' is printed, x is the last character in the string c, and counter is slength. Otherwise, no is False, c is neither equal to a nor equal to b, x is the last character in the string c, and counter is slength.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *tests is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, b is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, c is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength. The current value of no is False, x is the last character in the string c. If c is equal to a or b, 'NO' is printed and counter is slength. Otherwise, counter is equal to the length of string c.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *tests is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 2, stdin contains t-8 test cases, slength is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, b is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, c is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length slength, x is the last character in the string c. If no is True, then if c is equal to a or b, no is False and 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, counter is equal to slength, and 'NO' is printed. If no is False, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
