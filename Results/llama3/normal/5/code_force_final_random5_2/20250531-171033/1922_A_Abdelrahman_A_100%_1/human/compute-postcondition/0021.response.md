Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `no` is `False`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 2 characters and is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `x` is the second character in the string `c`, and `counter` is 1, and 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program has exited the innermost loop or if statement.
