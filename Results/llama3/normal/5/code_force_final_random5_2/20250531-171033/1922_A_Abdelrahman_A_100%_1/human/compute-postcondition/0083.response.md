Postcondition: ***`tests` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-8 test cases, `slength` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength`, `c` is a string of lowercase Latin letters of length `slength` that must have at least 1 character, `x` is the first character in the string `c`. If `x` is not present in the character at index `counter` of strings `a` and `b`, then `no` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.***
