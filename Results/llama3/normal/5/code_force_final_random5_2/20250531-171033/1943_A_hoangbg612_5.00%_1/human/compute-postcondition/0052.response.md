The only object in the loop head is variable  num and list  N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, N has at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the num is the second element in the list.
State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list**
