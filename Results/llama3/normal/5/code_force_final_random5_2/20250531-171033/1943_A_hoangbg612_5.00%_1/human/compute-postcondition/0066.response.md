Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, cur is the last element in the original list N plus 1, M is a dictionary where M[i] is the count of consecutive occurrences of i in the original list N and the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of variable `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `cur` now holds the value of the last element in the original list `N` plus 1. All other conditions and values of the variables `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain the same as in the initial state.
