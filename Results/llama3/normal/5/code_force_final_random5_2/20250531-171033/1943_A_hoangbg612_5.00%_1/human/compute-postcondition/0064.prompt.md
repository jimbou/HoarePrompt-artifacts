Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If the first element in N is greater than the current value of cur plus 1, then cur is set to 0 and M[cur] is 1. If the first element in N is less than or equal to cur, then cur is -1, M is a dictionary where M[-1] is 1. If the first element in N is greater than cur but not greater than cur plus 1, then cur is the first element of N and M[cur] is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list. If num is greater than cur, then cur is set to num and M[cur] is set to 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list. If num is greater than cur, then M[cur] is 1. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
