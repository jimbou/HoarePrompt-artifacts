Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list N, and cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1. The sum of the values in dictionary M equals S.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `cur`, which is incremented by 1. The dictionary `M` and the list `N` are still related, and the sum of the values in `M` is still equal to `S`.
