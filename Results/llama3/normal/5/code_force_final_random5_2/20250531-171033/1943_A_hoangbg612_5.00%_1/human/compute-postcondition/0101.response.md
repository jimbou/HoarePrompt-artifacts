Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, num is the next integer in the list N, cur is equal to num, M[cur] is 1.**

In this final state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`, which is the next integer in the sorted list `N`. The dictionary `M` now has a new entry where the key is the current value of `cur` (which is `num`) and the value is 1. All other variables, including `T`, `_`, `S`, and `N`, remain unchanged.
