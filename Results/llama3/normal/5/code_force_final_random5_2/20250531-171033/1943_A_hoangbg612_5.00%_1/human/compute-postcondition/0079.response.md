The code prints the value of `cur`, which is the smallest `i` such that `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, or the last element in the original list `N` if no such `i` exists.

Since `N` is an empty list, there is no last element in the original list `N`. Therefore, `cur` will be the smallest `i` such that `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

However, since `M` is a dictionary where `M[i]` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `i` in the original list `N`, and `N` is an empty list, all values in `M` will be 0.

Therefore, `cur` will be the smallest `i` such that `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, which means `cur` will be the smallest `i` such that 0 is less than or equal to `i`.

Since 0 is less than or equal to any integer, `cur` will be the smallest integer, which is 1.

Output: **1**
