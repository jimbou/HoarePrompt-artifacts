The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cur`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur`. If `cur` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, and `cur` is the largest integer in the original list `N` if it is greater than -1, otherwise -1. If the sum of the values in the dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. 

However, the loop will only execute if `cur` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cur` to be at least 1. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0.

State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `cur` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
