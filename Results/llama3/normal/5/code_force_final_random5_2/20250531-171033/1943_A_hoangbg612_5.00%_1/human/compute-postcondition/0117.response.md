Postcondition: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list `N`, and the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is 2 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and `i`.**
