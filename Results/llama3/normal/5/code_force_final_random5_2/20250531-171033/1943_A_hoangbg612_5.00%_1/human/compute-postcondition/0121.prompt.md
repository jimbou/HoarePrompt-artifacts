Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer (1 <= T <= 2 * 10^5), stdin contains multiple test cases with the first line of each test case containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    for i in range(cur):
        if M[i] <= i:
            cur = i
            break
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, and cur is the largest integer in the original list N if it is greater than -1, otherwise -1. If the sum of the values in the dictionary M equals S, then cur is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the value of cur is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where M[i] is the count of consecutive occurrences of i in the original list N, and cur is the smallest i such that M[i] is less than or equal to i, or the last element in the original list N if no such i exists, and the value of cur is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list N, and the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S. If the value of M[i] is less than or equal to the current value of i, then cur is the value of i. Otherwise, no changes are made to cur, and the value of cur is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
