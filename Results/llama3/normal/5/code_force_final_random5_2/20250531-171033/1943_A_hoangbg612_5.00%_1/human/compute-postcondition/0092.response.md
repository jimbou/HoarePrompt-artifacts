To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for num in N:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `num` and `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least 2 integers. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `N` to have at least 2 integers.

The state of `num` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, but we can infer that it is the next integer in the list `N`. Since `N` is sorted, the next integer in the list must be greater than or equal to the current integer.

The other variables `T`, `_`, `S`, `M`, and `cur` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `M` is a dictionary, `cur` is not set**
