The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and T, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than T, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, T is at least 1. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again T must be greater than 1.
State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, and cur is the largest integer in the original list N if it is greater than -1, otherwise -1**
