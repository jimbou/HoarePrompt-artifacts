According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list N. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, M is a dictionary, and cur is -1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the num is the first integer in the list.
State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary, cur is -1, num is the first integer in the list**
