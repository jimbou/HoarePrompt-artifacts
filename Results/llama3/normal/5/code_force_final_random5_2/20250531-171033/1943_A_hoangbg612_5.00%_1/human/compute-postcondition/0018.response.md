To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the second smallest integer in `N`. For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least one more element. Since `N` is a sorted list, the next element will be the third smallest integer in `N`. Therefore, `num` should be updated to the third smallest integer in `N`.

The state of `N` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables `_`, `S`, `T`, `cur`, and `M` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third smallest integer in `N`.**
