Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, cur is the largest integer in the original list N if it is greater than -1, otherwise -1. If the sum of the values in the dictionary M equals S, then cur is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, if the current value of M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is equal to the initial value of i, and i is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, if M[i] is less than or equal to i, then i is 1 and cur is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list. If M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is 2, i is 2, and M is a list where M[i] is less than or equal to i. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
