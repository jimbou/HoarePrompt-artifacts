Postcondition: ***T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If the first element in N is greater than the current value of cur plus 1, then cur is set to 0 and M[cur] is 1. If the first element in N is less than or equal to cur, then cur is -1, M is a dictionary where M[-1] is 1. If the first element in N is greater than cur but not greater than cur plus 1, then cur is the first element of N and M[cur] is 1.***
