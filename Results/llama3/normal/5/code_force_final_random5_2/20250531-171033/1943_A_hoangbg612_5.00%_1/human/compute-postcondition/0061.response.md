Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list, cur is the third element in the list, M[cur] is 1**

The code assigns the value of `num` to `cur`, which means `cur` now holds the value of the third element in the list `N`. Since `num` is the third element in the list, `cur` is now equal to this value. The second line assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`, which means the value of `M` at the index equal to the value of `cur` (which is the third element in the list `N`) is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
