Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, if the smallest integer in N is greater than -1, then cur is set to the smallest integer in N, M is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is cur and the value is 1, and the smallest integer in N is greater than 0. Otherwise, cur remains -1, M is a dictionary with M[-1] is 1, and the smallest integer in N is less than or equal to -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second smallest integer in N. If num is greater than the smallest integer in N (or -1), then cur is the second smallest integer in N and M is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the original smallest integer in N (or -1) and the value is 1, and the key is the second smallest integer in N and the value is 1. Otherwise, cur is the smallest integer in N if it is greater than -1, otherwise -1, and M is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is cur and the value is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third smallest integer in `N`. If `num` is larger than `cur`, then `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
