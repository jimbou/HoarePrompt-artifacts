Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, num is the next integer in the list N, cur is incremented by 1**

The code snippet increments the value of `cur` by 1, but does not affect any other variables. The `break` statement does not have any impact on the variables as it is used to exit a loop, but there is no loop in this code snippet. Therefore, the final state includes all the variables from the initial state with their original values, except for `cur`, which is incremented by 1.
