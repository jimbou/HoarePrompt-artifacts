To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(cur):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `cur`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cur`. If `cur` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is either 1 or greater than 1 (since `T` is at least 2). If `cur` is 1, the loop will not execute again. If `cur` is greater than 1, the loop will execute again.

Since we want the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `cur` to be greater than 1.

The state of `i` also needs to be adjusted. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to set `i` to 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the last iteration).

The other variables (`T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and `M`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list `N`, and the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, `cur` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
