Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary, cur is 0, and num is greater than 0.**

The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1, changing it from -1 to 0. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables but rather terminates the loop or the current execution block. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
