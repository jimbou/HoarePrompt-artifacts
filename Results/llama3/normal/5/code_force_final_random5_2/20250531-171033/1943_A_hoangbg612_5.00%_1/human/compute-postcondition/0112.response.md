To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(cur):`. The objects involved are `i` and `cur`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `cur`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `cur` is 0 (because the value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to the current value of `i`, which is 0).

For the loop to execute again, `cur` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list N, and the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, cur is greater than 0, i is 1**
