Postcondition: ***T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary. If the current value of num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is set to 0 and num is greater than 0. Otherwise, the values of T, _, S, N, M, cur, and num remain unchanged.***
