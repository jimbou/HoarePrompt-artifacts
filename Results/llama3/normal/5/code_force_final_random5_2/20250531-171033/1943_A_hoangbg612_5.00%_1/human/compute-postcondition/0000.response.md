The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of each test case contains a single integer `n`, this integer is read and assigned to `T`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer (1 <= T <= 2 * 10^5), stdin contains multiple test cases with the first line of each test case containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n)**
