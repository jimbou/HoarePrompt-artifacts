Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T` and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

3. The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order.

4. It then initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will be used to keep track of the current MEX value.

5. The program creates a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each number in the array.

6. It then iterates over the sorted array. If the current number is greater than `cur`, it checks if the current number is greater than `cur + 1`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it sets `cur` to the current number and sets the frequency of `cur` in the dictionary `M` to 1.

7. If the current number is not greater than `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1.

8. After the loop, it checks if the sum of the frequencies of all numbers in the dictionary `M` is equal to the size of the array `n`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.

9. The program then iterates over the range from 0 to `cur` and checks if the frequency of the current number in the dictionary `M` is less than or equal to the current number. If it is, it sets `cur` to the current number and breaks the loop.

10. Finally, the program prints the value of `cur`, which is the final score of the game.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score. The use of the dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each number in the array allows the program to efficiently keep track of the MEX value. The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of the frequencies of all numbers in the dictionary `M` is equal to the size of the array `n`.

Correctness: **True**
