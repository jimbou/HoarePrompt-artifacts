The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and cur, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cur`. If `i` is less than `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `cur` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `cur` must be at least 1.
State: **T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, i is 1, cur is at least 1**
