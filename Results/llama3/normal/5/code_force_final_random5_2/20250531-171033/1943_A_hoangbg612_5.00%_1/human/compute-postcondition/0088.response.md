Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary where M[cur] is 1, cur is equal to num, num is greater than 0 if cur was not set to 0.**

The code block modifies the values of `cur` and `M` while leaving the values of `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and `num` unchanged. The first line assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The second line adds an entry to the dictionary `M` where the key is the current value of `cur` (which is now equal to `num`) and the value is 1. The value of `num` remains greater than 0 if `cur` was not set to 0, and the value of `cur` is now equal to `num`.
