The code snippet consists of two lines: `cur = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, and the second line is a break statement that does not affect any variables.

Since `i` is 1, `cur` becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code.

Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, i is 1, cur is 1**
