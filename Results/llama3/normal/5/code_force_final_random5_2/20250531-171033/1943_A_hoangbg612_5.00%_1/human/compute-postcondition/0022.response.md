Output State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third smallest integer in `N`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `M[cur]`, which is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables maintain their initial state.
