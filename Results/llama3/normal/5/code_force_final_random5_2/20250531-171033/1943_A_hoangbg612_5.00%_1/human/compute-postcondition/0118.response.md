Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list N, and the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S. If the value of M[i] is less than or equal to the current value of i, then cur is the value of i. Otherwise, no changes are made to cur.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to iterate until it finds a value of i such that M[i] is less than or equal to i. At this point, the value of cur will be updated to the value of i. If no such value of i is found, the value of cur will remain unchanged. The other variables in the precondition, T, _, S, N, and M, will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
