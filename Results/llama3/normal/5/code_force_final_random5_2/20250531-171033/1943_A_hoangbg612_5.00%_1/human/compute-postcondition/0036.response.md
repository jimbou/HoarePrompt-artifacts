Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, cur is 2, i is 2, M is a list where M[i] is less than or equal to i.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of T, _, S, or N. The first line assigns the value of i to cur, making cur equal to 2. The second line, break, does not affect any variables. The precondition states that if M[i] is less than or equal to i, then i is 2 and cur is 2. Since cur is now 2, this condition is satisfied, and i is indeed 2. The list M is not modified by the code, but its properties are constrained by the precondition.
