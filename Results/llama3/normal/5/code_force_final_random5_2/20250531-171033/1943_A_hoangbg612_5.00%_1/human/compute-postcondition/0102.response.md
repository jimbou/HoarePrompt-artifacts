Output State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, while the values of `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. The list `N` still has at least 3 integers and is sorted, and `num` is still the next integer in the list `N`.
