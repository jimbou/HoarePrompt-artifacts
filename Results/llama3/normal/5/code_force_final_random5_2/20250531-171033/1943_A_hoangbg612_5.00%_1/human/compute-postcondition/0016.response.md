The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Since `cur` is the smallest integer in `N` if it is greater than -1, otherwise -1, and `M` initially has a single key-value pair where the key is `cur` and the value is 1, the value associated with `cur` in `M` will now be 2.

Output State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second smallest integer in `N`, `cur` is the smallest integer in `N` if it is greater than -1, otherwise -1, and `M` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `cur` and the value is 2.**
