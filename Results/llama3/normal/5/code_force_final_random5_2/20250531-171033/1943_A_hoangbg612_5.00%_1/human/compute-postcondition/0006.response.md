Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, cur is 0, M is an empty dictionary, num is the smallest integer in N and its current value is greater than 0 and also greater than cur.**

Explanation:
The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1, changing it from -1 to 0. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables as it is used to exit a loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it does not have any impact on the state. All other variables (`T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `num`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
