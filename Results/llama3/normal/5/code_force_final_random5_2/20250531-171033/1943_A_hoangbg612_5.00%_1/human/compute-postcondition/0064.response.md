Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, cur is the last element in the original list N, M is a dictionary where M[i] is the count of consecutive occurrences of i in the original list N.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list N is empty, the variable cur holds the last element of the original list N, and the dictionary M contains the count of consecutive occurrences of each number in the original list N. The other variables T, _, and S remain unchanged.
