Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third smallest integer in N, cur is 1.**

The code block consists of two lines: `cur += 1` and `break`. The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1, making it 1. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables. 

The initial state variables `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and `num` are not modified by the code block, so their values remain the same. The only change is the value of `cur`, which is now 1.
