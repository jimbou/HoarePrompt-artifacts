To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `num` and the list `N`. 

For the loop to execute, `N` must have at least one element, because the loop iterates over the elements of `N`. If `N` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state of `N` needs to be adjusted to ensure it has at least one element.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, cur is -1, M is an empty dictionary, num is the first element in N**
