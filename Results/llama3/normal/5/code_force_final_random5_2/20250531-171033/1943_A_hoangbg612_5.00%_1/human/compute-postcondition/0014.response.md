Postcondition: ***T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second smallest integer in N, if num is greater than cur + 1, then cur is the second smallest integer in N if the original smallest integer was greater than -1, otherwise 0, and M is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is the original smallest integer in N (or -1) and the value is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
