To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for num in N:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `num` and `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least one more integer. Therefore, `N` must have at least 3 integers.

The state of `num` is not explicitly defined at the end of the previous iteration, but we know that it is an integer in the list `N`. For the loop to execute again, `num` must be the next integer in the list `N`.

The other variables `_`, `S`, `T`, and `M` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`**
