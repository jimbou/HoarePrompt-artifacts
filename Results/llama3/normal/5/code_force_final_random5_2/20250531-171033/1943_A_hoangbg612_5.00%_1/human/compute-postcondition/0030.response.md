Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, cur is equal to the initial value of i, i is 0, and the current value of M[i] is less than or equal to i.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to the initial value of `i`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables.
