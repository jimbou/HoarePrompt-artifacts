To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `T` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range it iterates over, which is `T`).

Given that `T` is an integer and 1 <= T <= 2 * 10^5, for the loop to execute, `T` must be at least 1. Since `_` is the loop variable, it will take on values from 0 to T-1 during the loop's execution. Therefore, before the loop starts, `_` should be 0.

State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 0**
