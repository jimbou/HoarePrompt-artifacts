Postcondition: ***T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second smallest integer in N. If num is greater than the smallest integer in N (or -1), then cur is the second smallest integer in N and M is a dictionary with two key-value pairs where the key is the original smallest integer in N (or -1) and the value is 1, and the key is the second smallest integer in N and the value is 1. Otherwise, cur is the smallest integer in N if it is greater than -1, otherwise -1, and M is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is cur and the value is 2.***
