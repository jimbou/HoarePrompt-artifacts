Output State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with `M[-1]` is 1, and `num` is the smallest integer in `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include a key-value pair where the key is `-1` and the value is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
