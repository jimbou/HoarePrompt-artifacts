Postcondition: ***T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, if the smallest integer in N is greater than -1, then cur is set to the smallest integer in N, M is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is cur and the value is 1, and the smallest integer in N is greater than 0. Otherwise, cur remains -1, M is a dictionary with M[-1] is 1, and the smallest integer in N is less than or equal to -1.***
