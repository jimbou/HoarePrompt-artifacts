Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, M is a dictionary where the key cur has a value of 1, and cur is equal to num.**

In this output state, the value of cur is updated to be equal to num, and the dictionary M now has a key-value pair where the key is cur (which is equal to num) and the value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
