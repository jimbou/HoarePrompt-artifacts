Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, cur is -1, M is a dictionary where M[-1] is 1, and num is the first element in N, and num is less than or equal to cur**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Since `cur` is -1, `M[-1]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `M` is an empty dictionary, so `M[-1]` is created and assigned a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
