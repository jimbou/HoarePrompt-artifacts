Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list N, and the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, cur is 2, i is 2**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, making `cur` equal to 2. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are modified by the code.
