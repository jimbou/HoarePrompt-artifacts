Postcondition: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary. If the first integer in the list (num) is greater than the current integer (cur), then M[cur] is 1, cur is equal to num, and num is greater than 0 if cur was not set to 0. Otherwise, M[cur] is increased by 1, cur is -1, and num is less than or equal to cur.**
