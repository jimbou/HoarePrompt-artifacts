According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur`. If `cur` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `cur` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `cur` must be greater than 1.
State: **T is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 0, S is an integer, N is an empty list, if M[i] is less than or equal to i, then i is 2 and cur is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
