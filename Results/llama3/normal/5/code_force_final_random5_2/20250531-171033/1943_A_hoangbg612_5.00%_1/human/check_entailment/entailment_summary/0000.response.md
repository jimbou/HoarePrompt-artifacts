Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum score that Alice can achieve in a game where she and Bob take turns picking elements from an array. The score is determined by the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program works by first sorting the input array and then iterating through it to count the occurrences of each integer. It uses a dictionary `M` to store the counts of each integer. The program then checks if the sum of the counts is equal to the size of the input array. If it is, it increments the current value `cur` by 1.

The program then iterates through the dictionary `M` to find the smallest integer `i` such that the count of `i` is less than or equal to `i`. This is because Alice wants to maximize the score, so she will try to include as many small integers as possible in her array. If such an integer is found, the program sets `cur` to `i`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `cur`, which represents the maximum score that Alice can achieve.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the maximum representable value for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
