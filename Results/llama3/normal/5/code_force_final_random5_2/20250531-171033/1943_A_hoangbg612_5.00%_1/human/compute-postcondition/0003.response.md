To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` has at least one element. Since `N` is a sorted list of integers, we can assume that the first element is the smallest. Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `S` is an integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the smallest integer in `N`**
