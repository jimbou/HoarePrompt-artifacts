To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `cur`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cur`. If `cur` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`T` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 1, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `cur` is at least 1, `M` is a dictionary where `M[i]` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `i` in the original list `N`, `i` is 0**
