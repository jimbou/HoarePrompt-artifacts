Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, M is a dictionary where M[cur] is increased by 1, cur is -1, num is the first integer in the list, and num is less than or equal to cur**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables retain their initial state except for the dictionary M, where the value of M[cur] is incremented by 1. The value of cur remains -1, and num remains the first integer in the list N, which is still sorted and has at least one integer. The values of T, _, and S remain unchanged.
