To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(cur):`. The objects involved are `i` and `cur`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cur`. If `cur` is at least 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is at least 1, and `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute again, `cur` must be at least 2, and `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, if M[i] is less than or equal to i, then cur is 0. Otherwise, cur is at least 2, M is a dictionary where M[i] is the count of consecutive occurrences of i in the original list N, and i is 1**
