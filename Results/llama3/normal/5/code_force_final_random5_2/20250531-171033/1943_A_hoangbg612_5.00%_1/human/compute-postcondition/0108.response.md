To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `cur`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cur`. If `cur` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, the state of `cur` depends on the sum of the values in dictionary `M` and the value of `S`. If the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

Since `N` is an empty list, the last integer in the original list `N` is undefined. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of `cur` based on the current state.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `cur` to be at least 1. We can do this by assuming that the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`, which would make `cur` the last integer in the original list `N` plus 1. Since `N` is empty, the last integer in the original list `N` is undefined, so we can assume it to be 0. Therefore, `cur` would be 1.

State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list N, and the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, cur is 1, i is 0**
