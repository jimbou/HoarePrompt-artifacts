To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `cur` is either 1 or at least 2, depending on the value of `M[i]`. Since `M[i]` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `i` in the original list `N`, and `N` is an empty list, `M[i]` is 0. Therefore, `cur` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `cur` is 1, the loop will only execute if `cur` is greater than 1. Therefore, `cur` must be at least 2.

State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where M[i] is the count of consecutive occurrences of i in the original list N, i is 2, and cur is at least 2**
