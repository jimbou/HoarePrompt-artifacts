Output State: **T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 1, S is an integer, N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list, cur is incremented by 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `cur += 1` and `break`. The first line increments the value of `cur` by 1. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or the nearest enclosing loop. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables.

The initial state provides information about several variables: `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and `num`. Since the code snippet does not modify any of these variables except for `cur`, their values remain the same. The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, but its original value is not provided, so we can only state that it has been incremented.

Therefore, the final output state includes all the variables from the initial state with their values unchanged, except for `cur`, which has been incremented by 1.
