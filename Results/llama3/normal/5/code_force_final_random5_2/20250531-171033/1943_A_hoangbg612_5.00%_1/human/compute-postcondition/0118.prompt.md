Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list N. If the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S, then cur is the last integer in the original list N plus 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list N, and the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S. If the value of M[i] is less than or equal to the current value of i, then cur is 0 and i is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is an integer and must be at least 2, _ is 2, S is an integer, N is an empty list, M is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list N, and the sum of the values in dictionary M equals S. If M[1] is less than or equal to 1, then cur is 1 and i is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `S` is an integer, `N` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and its corresponding value is the number of times that integer appears in the original list `N`, and the sum of the values in dictionary `M` equals `S`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is 2 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
