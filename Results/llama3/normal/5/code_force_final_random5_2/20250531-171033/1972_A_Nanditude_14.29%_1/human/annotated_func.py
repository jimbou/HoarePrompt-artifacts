#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a 2D list of length 3, where the first element is a positive integer, the second element is a list of non-decreasing positive integers, and the third element is a list of non-decreasing positive integers.
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted 2D list in descending order, where the first element is a positive integer, the second element is a list of non-decreasing positive integers, and the third element is a list of non-decreasing positive integers. The sorting is based on the first element of each sublist, and the original order of elements with equal first elements is preserved.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a 2D list as input and returns a sorted version of the list in descending order. The sorting is based on the first element of each sublist, and the original order of elements with equal first elements is preserved. The function does not modify the input list and returns a new sorted list.
