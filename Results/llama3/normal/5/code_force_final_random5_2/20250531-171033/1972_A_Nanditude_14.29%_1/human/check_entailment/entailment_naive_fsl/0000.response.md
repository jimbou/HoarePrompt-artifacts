Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input arrays `a` and `b` have different lengths. The program assumes that both arrays have the same length `n`, but it does not check for this condition. If the lengths are different, the program will raise an error when trying to access an index that is out of range.

For example, if the input is:

```
2
3
1 2 3
4 5 6 7
```

The program will raise an error when trying to access `a[3]` because `a` only has 3 elements.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal before proceeding with the rest of the logic.
