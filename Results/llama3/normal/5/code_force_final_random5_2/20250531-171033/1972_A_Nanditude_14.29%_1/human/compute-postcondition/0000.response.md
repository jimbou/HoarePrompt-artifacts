Output State: **The program returns a sorted 2D list in descending order, where the first element is a positive integer, the second element is a list of non-decreasing positive integers, and the third element is a list of non-decreasing positive integers. The sorting is based on the first element of each sublist, and the original order of elements with equal first elements is preserved.**
