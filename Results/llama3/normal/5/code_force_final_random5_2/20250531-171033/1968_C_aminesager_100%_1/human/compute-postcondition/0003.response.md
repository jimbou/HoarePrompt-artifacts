To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`). Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), which does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2, and `i` should be 1 (the starting value of the range).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integer 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input.**
