The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines of input, the first line of the first test case is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, with the first line of the first test case having been read.**

In natural language, this means that the variable `t` now holds an integer value between 2 and 500, and the standard input still contains multiple test cases, but the first line of the first test case has been consumed.
