The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is the sum of the element at index `i-1` in list `a` and the element at index `i-1` in list `T`. Since `i` is 1, this means the new element is the sum of the first element in `a` (which is 1000) and the first element in `T`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], and the string "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" has been printed.**
