The code appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is the sum of the element at index `i - 1` in `a` and the element at index `i - 1` in `T`. Since `i` is 3, the new element is `a[2] + T[2]`. The value of `a[2]` is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`, so the new element is `1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2]`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2]**
