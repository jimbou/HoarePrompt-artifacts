Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, with the first line of the first test case having been read.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`, `result` is a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a`, and the string representation of the elements in `a` which is "1000 [1000 + cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`]" is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and `a[n-1] + T[n-1]`, and the string "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), n is an integer, i is n, T is a list of integers, a is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0] and 1000 + a[n-1] + T[n-1] and a[2-1] + T[2-1] and a[3-1] + T[3-1] and ... and a[n-1] + T[n-1], the string "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" has been printed, and result is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in a, separated by spaces, and result is printed, result (where result is the concatenation of all elements in a, separated by spaces)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
