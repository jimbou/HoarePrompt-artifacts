Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0] and 1000 + a[n-1] + T[n-1] and a[2-1] + T[2-1]**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, this new element is `a[1] + T[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
