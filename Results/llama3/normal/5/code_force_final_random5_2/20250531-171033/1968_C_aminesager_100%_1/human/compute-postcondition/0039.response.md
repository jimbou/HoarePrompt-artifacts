Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n-1 integers. It then calculates the cumulative sum of these integers, starting from 1000, and prints the resulting list of integers. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.**
