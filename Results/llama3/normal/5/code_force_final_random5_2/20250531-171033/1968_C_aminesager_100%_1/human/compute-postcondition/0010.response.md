Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`, `result` is a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `result` is a string that contains the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a`. The elements in `a` are 1000 and the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
