Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), `n` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, `a[n-2] + T[n-2]`, and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `result` is a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a` which is "1000 `a[n-2] + T[n-2]` `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`" and is being printed, `stdin` contains no input**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is still greater than itself, `i` is still equal to `n`, `T` is still a list of integers, `a` now contains three elements: 1000, the sum of `a[n-2]` and `T[n-2]`, and the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`. The `result` string now contains the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a`, including the new element `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, and is being printed. The `stdin` remains empty.
