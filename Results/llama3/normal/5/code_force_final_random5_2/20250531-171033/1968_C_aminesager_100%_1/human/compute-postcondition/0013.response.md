The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`, `result` is a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a`, and the string representation of the elements in `a` which is "1000 [1000 + cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`]" is being printed**
