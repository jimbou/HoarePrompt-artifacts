Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. The key insight is that for each `x_i`, we can choose `a_i` to be `a_{i-1} + x_i`, which ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`.

The program initializes `a` with a large value `1000` and then iteratively appends `a_{i-1} + x_i` to `a` for each `x_i`. This ensures that `a_i` is always greater than `x_i` and that the modulo condition is satisfied.

The program also handles the edge case where `n=2` correctly, by simply appending `x_2` to `a` after the initial value `1000`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
