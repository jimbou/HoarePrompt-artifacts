Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer, i is n, T is a list of integers, a is a list containing the integers 1000 and a[n-1] + T[n-1], result is a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in a which is "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" and is being printed, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), `n` remains an integer, `i` is now equal to `n`, `T` remains a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the sum of the last element of `a` and the last element of `T`, `result` is a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a` which is "1000" followed by the sum of the last element of `a` and the last element of `T`, and `stdin` contains no input.
