Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0] and 1000 + a[n-1] + T[n-1] and a[2-1] + T[2-1] and a[3-1] + T[3-1] and ... and a[n-1] + T[n-1], and the string "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" has been printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the list `a` has been populated with the cumulative sum of the elements of `T`, starting from 1000. The other variables remain unchanged.
