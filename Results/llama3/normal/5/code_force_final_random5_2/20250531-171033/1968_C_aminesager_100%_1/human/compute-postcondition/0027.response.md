To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integer 1000, and the string "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" has been printed**
