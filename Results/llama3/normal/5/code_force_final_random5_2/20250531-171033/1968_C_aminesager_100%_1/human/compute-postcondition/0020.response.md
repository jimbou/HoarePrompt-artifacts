Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), `n` must be greater than `n+1`, `i` is `n+1`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, `a[n-2] + T[n-2]`, `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `result` is a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a` which is "1000 `a[n-2] + T[n-2]` `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`" and is being printed, `stdin` contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending another element `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `result` string now contains the space-separated string representation of the updated elements in `a`.
