Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer, i is n, T is a list of integers, a is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first n-1 elements of T, and the string representation of the elements in a which is "1000 [1000 + cumulative sum of the first n-1 elements of T]" has been printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `n` will remain an integer, and the value of `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `T` will still contain integers, and the list `a` will contain the integers 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`. The string representation of the elements in `a` will have been printed.
