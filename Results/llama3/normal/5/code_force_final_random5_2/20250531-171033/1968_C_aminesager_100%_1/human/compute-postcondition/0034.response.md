Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), n is an integer, i is n, T is a list of integers, a is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0] and 1000 + a[n-1] + T[n-1] and a[2-1] + T[2-1] and a[3-1] + T[3-1] and ... and a[n-1] + T[n-1], and the string "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), `n` remains an integer, `i` becomes equal to `n`, `T` remains a list of integers, and `a` becomes a list containing the initial value 1000 and the cumulative sums of the elements of `T` added to the previous elements of `a`, up to the last element of `T`. The string "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" has been printed.
