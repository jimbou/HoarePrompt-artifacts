Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and `a[n-2] + T[n-2]`, `result` is a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a` which is "1000 `a[n-2] + T[n-2]`" and is being printed, `stdin` contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the sum of the element at index `i-1` (which is `n-2`) and the element at index `i-1` (which is `n-2`) of list `T`. The value of `result` has also been updated to include the string representation of the new element appended to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
