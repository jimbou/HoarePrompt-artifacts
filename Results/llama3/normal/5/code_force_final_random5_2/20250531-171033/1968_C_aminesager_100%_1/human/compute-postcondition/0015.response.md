To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integer 1000, `result` is a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a` which is "1000" and is being printed, `stdin` contains no input**
