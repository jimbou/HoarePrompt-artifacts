The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0] and 1000 + a[n-1] + T[n-1] and a[2-1] + T[2-1]**
