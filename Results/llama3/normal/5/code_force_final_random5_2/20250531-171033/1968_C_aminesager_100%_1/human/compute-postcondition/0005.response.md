To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

The state of `t`, `T`, and `a` does not need to be adjusted because they are not in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0]**
