Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1]**.

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the second last element of `a` (i.e., `a[i - 1]` or `1000 + T[0]`) and the second element of `T` (i.e., `T[i - 1]` or `T[1]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
