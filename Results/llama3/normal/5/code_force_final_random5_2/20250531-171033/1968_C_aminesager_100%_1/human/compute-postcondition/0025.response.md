The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive). So for the loop to be executed one more time, t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and `a[n-1] + T[n-1]`, and the string "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" is being printed**
