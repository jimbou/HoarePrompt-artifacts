Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), n is an integer, i is n, T is a list of integers, a is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0] and 1000 + a[n-1] + T[n-1] and a[2-1] + T[2-1] and a[3-1] + T[3-1] and ... and a[n-1] + T[n-1], the string "1000 a[n-1] + T[n-1]" has been printed, and result is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in a, separated by spaces.**

In this output state, the value of `result` is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `a`, separated by spaces. For example, if `a` is `[1000, 1001, 1002, 1003]`, then `result` would be `"1000 1001 1002 1003"`. The other variables remain unchanged.
