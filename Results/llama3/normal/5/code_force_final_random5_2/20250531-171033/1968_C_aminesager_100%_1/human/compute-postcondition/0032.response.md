Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0] and 1000 + a[n-1] + T[n-1] and a[2-1] + T[2-1] and a[3-1] + T[3-1]**.

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the element at index `i-1` in `a` (which is `a[2]`) and the element at index `i-1` in `T` (which is `T[2]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
