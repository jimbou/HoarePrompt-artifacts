The code prints a string containing the space-separated string representation of the elements in `a`. The list `a` contains two elements: the integer 1000 and the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`. Since the exact elements of `T` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the cumulative sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string representation of 1000 and the calculated sum.

Output: **1000 [1000 + cumulative sum of the first n-1 elements of T]**
