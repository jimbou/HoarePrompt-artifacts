Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0]**.

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the sum of the first element of `a` (1000) and the first element of `T` (T[0]). The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `T` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line of input.
