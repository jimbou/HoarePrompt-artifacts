Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still an integer, `i` reaches its final value which is `n-1`, `T` remains a list of integers, and `a` becomes a list containing the initial value 1000 and the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of `T`.
