Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list of non-negative integers. This function effectively measures the total "beauty" or variation in the sorted list.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of integers, applies the `func_1` function to each list, stores the results, and prints each result.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by sorting the array in ascending order. This is because the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and sorting the array in ascending order maximizes these differences.

Therefore, `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the input list and then computing the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

`func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each input list and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
