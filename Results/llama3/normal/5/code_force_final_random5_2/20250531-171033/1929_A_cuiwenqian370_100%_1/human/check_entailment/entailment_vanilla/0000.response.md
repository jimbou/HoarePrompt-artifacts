Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes an array as input, sorts it, and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

3. `func_2` reads input from the standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

4. To determine the correctness of the program, we need to check if `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array.

5. The key insight here is that the maximum beauty of the array is achieved when the elements are arranged in ascending order. This is because the beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and the largest difference is obtained when the smallest element is followed by the largest element, the second smallest element is followed by the second largest element, and so on.

6. `func_1` correctly implements this insight by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty.

7. Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
