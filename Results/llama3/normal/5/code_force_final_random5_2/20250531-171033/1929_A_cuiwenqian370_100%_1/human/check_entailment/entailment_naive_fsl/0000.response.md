Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program calculates the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements in any way. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

The program uses a sorting approach to maximize the beauty of the array. By sorting the array in ascending order, the program ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty of the array.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the array has duplicate elements or where the array has a length of 2. The program also handles cases where the array has a large number of elements or where the elements have large values.

The program's output matches the expected output for all the provided test cases, and it is likely to produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
