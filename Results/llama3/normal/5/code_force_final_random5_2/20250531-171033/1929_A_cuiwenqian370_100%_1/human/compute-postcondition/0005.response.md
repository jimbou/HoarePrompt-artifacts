The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 plus 2n, `t` is greater than 1 plus 2n. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 plus 2n and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2 plus 2n.
State: **array is a list of n integers from data, index is 1 plus 2n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array) and the result of func_1(array), n is an integer from data, _ is 2 plus 2n, t is greater than 2 plus 2n**
