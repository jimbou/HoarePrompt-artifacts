Output State: **n is an integer from data, index is 1 plus 2n plus 1 plus n, array is a list of n integers from data, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array) three times, t is greater than 2 plus 2n, _ is 2 plus 2n.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to an integer from the data. The value of `index` is incremented by 1 plus `n`, reflecting the movement through the data. The `array` variable is reassigned to a list of `n` integers from the data. The `results` list is updated to include the result of `func_1(array)` three times. The value of `t` remains greater than 2 plus 2n, and the value of `_` remains 2 plus 2n, as these variables are not modified by the code.
