Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers of length n, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and all elements in the array are non-negative integers less than or equal to 10^9.
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `array` is a sorted list of integers of length n, `i` is n-1, `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `array`
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of a sorted list of integers of length n.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list of non-negative integers. It takes a list of integers as input, sorts it in ascending order, and then computes the sum of the absolute differences between adjacent elements. The function returns this sum as its output, effectively measuring the total "beauty" or variation in the sorted list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: array is a list of integers, t is 0, index is 1 plus t*n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array) t times, stdin is empty
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: array is a list of integers, t is at least 1, index is 1 plus t*n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array) t times, stdin is empty, and the result is printed t times.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of integers, applies the func_1 function to each list, stores the results, and prints each result.
