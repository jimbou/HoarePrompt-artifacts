Output State: **array is a list of integers, t is 0, index is 1 plus t*n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array) t times, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the array is a list of integers, the value of t is 0, the index is 1 plus the product of t and n, the results list contains the result of func_1(array) repeated t times, and the stdin remains empty.
