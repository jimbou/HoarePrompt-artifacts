Output State: **array is a list of integers, t is an integer greater than 0, index is 1 plus n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array), stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `array` has been updated to a new list of integers, which was previously stored in `data` from index `index` to `index + n`. The value of `index` has been incremented by `n`, which is the number of elements in the new `array`. The `results` list now contains the result of calling `func_1` with the new `array` as an argument. The values of `t` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
