Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: array is a list of integers, t is an integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(array)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: array is a list of integers, t is an integer greater than 0, index is 1 plus n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array), stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: array is a list of n integers from data, index is 1 plus 2n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array) and the result of func_1(array), n is an integer from data

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer from data, index is 1 plus 2n plus 1 plus n, array is a list of n integers from data, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array) three times, t is greater than 2 plus 2n, _ is 2 plus 2n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
