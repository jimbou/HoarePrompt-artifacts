The code prints the value of `result`. However, the value of `result` is not explicitly defined in the given precondition. But, we can infer that `result` is likely to be the result of `func_1(array)` since `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(array)` at least once.

Output: **result (which is the result of func_1(array))**
