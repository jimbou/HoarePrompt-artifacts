Output State: **array is a list of integers, t is at least 1, index is 1 plus t*n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array) t times, stdin is empty, and the result is printed t times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the array remains unchanged, t is at least 1, the index is 1 plus t times n, the results list contains the result of func_1(array) t times, the standard input is empty, and the result is printed t times.
