Output State: **array is a list of n integers from data, index is 1 plus 2n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(array) and the result of func_1(array), n is an integer from data**

In this output state, the value of `array` has been updated to a list of `n` integers from `data`, starting from the index `1 + n`. The value of `index` has been incremented by `n` twice, resulting in `1 + 2n`. The `results` list now contains two elements: the result of `func_1(array)` before the code execution and the result of `func_1(array)` after the code execution, which is the same as the previous result since the input `array` has not changed. The value of `n` has been updated to an integer from `data`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Stdin remains empty as it was initially.
