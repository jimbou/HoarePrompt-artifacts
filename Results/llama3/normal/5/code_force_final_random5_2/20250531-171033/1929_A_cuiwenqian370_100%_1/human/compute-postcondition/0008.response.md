To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `result` and the list `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 result, the loop will execute. Since `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(array)` `t` times, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure that `results` has at least 1 result.

State: **`array` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 1, `index` is 1 plus `t*n`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(array)` at least once, `stdin` is empty**
