Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

Function 1 sorts the input array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is the correct approach to find the maximum beauty of the array, as sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Function 2 reads the input data, calls Function 1 for each test case, and prints the results. The input data is read correctly, and the results are printed as required.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
