To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the `results` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(array)` at least once. To execute the loop again, `results` must have at least one more element.

The only object in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `results`. Since `results` is a list, we can add one more element to it.

The other variables, `array`, `t`, `index`, `stdin`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`array` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 1, `index` is 1 plus `t*n`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(array)` at least twice, `stdin` is empty, and the result is printed**
