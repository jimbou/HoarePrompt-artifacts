To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for result in results:`

The only object in the loop head is `results`, which is a list containing the result of `func_1(array)` at least twice.

To execute the loop again, `results` must have at least one more element. Since `results` already has at least two elements, we can adjust its state to have at least three elements.

The other variables (`array`, `t`, `index`, `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`array` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 1, `index` is 1 plus `t*n`, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(array)` at least three times, `stdin` is empty, and the result is printed**
