This function calculates and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list of non-negative integers. It takes a list of integers as input, sorts it in ascending order, and then computes the sum of the absolute differences between adjacent elements. The function returns this sum as its output, effectively measuring the total "beauty" or variation in the sorted list.
