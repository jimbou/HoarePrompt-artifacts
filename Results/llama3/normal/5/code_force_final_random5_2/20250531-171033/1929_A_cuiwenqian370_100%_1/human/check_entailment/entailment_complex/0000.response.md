Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

Function 1 sorts the input array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is a correct approach to find the maximum beauty of the array, as sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of integers, applies Function 1 to each list, stores the results, and prints each result. This is a correct way to handle multiple test cases and print the results.

Therefore, the given program is correct, as it correctly implements the required functionality and handles multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
