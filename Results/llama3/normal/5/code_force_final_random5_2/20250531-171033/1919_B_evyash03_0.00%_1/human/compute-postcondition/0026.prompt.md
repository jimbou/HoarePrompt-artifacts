Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is 0, balance is 0.
Code of the loop:
for char in expression:
    if char == '+':
        balance += 1
    elif char == '-':
        balance -= 1
    if balance < 0:
        count += 1
        balance = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 1 character, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression. If the current value of char is '-', then count is 1, char is the first character in the expression, and balance is 0. Otherwise, the state of count, char, and balance remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 2 characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `char` is the second character in the `expression`. If `char` is '-', then `count` is 2 and `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `count` and `balance` retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 3 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, char is the third character in the expression. If the third character of expression is '+', balance is increased by 1. If the third character of expression is '-', balance is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made to balance. If balance is less than 0, count is increased by 1 and balance is set to 0. Otherwise, no change is made to count and balance.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
