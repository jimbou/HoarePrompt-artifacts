Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 3 characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `char` is the third character in the `expression`, `balance` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `expression` remains unchanged, still consisting of "+" and "-" characters with a minimum length of 3. The `length` variable still holds the length of the `expression` string. The `char` variable remains the same, representing the third character in the `expression`. The only change is in the `balance` variable, which has been decremented by 1.
