Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 2 characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `char` is the second character in the `expression`, `count` is 1 (if the current value of `char` is '-', otherwise it remains unchanged), `balance` is -1 (if the current value of `char` is '-', otherwise it remains -1).**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `expression` still consists of "+" and "-" characters with a length of at least 2, and its length is still stored in the variable `length`. The second character of `expression` is still stored in `char`. The value of `count` remains 1 if `char` is '-', otherwise it doesn't change. The value of `balance` is now -1, regardless of the value of `char`.
