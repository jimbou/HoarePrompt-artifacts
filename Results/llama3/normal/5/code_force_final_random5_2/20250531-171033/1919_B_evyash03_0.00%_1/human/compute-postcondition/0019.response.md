To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head consists of the variable `char` and the string `expression`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 2 characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `char` is the second character in the `expression`. If `char` is '-', then `count` is 2 and `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `count` and `balance` retain their initial values.

For the loop to execute one more time, `expression` must have at least 3 characters, and `char` must be the third character in the `expression`. The value of `length` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, so we cannot adjust it. The values of `count` and `balance` are not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust them either.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 3 characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `char` is the third character in the `expression`.**
