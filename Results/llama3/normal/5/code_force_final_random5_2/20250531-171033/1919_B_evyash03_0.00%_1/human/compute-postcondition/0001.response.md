The only objects in the loop head are variables  char and expression, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression.  If the expression has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, count is 0 and balance is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the expression must have at least 1 character and the char is the first character in the expression.
State: **expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 1 character, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is 0, balance is 0, char is the first character in the expression**
