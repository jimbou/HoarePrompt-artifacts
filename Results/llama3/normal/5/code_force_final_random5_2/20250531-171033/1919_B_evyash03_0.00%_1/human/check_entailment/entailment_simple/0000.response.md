Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting a given string of '+' and '-' characters into non-empty arrays and calculating the penalty for each array.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then splits the string into parts separated by '-' characters and calculates the total length of these parts.

The program then calls a function `func_1` with the string and the total length of the parts as arguments. This function iterates over the characters in the string, maintaining a balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments a count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the balance is positive, otherwise, it returns the count.

The program then prints the result of the function call.

The correctness of the program can be verified by analyzing the logic of the function `func_1`. The function correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by splitting the string into parts separated by '-' characters and calculating the penalty for each part. The use of a balance variable to keep track of the '+' and '-' characters ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the string contains multiple '+' or '-' characters in a row.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
