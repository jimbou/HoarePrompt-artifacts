#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 3 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, char is the last character in the expression. If the last character of expression is '+', balance is increased by 1. If the last character of expression is '-', balance is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made to balance. If balance is less than 0, count is increased by 1 and balance is set to 0. Otherwise, no change is made to count and balance.
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the total number of times the balance was negative plus 1 if the balance is positive, otherwise, it returns the total number of times the balance was negative.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total number of times the balance was negative plus 1 if the balance is positive, otherwise, it returns the total number of times the balance was negative, based on a given string expression consisting of "+" and "-" characters.
