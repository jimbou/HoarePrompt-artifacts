Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting a given array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program first splits the input string into parts separated by '-' characters. It then calculates the total length of these parts. The function func_1 is used to calculate the minimum possible penalty.

The function func_1 iterates over the characters in the input string. If the character is '+', it increments the balance. If the character is '-', it decrements the balance. If the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the balance is positive, otherwise, it returns the count.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly splits the input string into parts, calculates the total length of these parts, and uses the function func_1 to calculate the minimum possible penalty. The function func_1 correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by iterating over the characters in the input string and updating the balance and count accordingly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
