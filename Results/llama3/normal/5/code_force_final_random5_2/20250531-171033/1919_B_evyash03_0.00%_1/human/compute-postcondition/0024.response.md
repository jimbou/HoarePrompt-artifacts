Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 3 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, char is the third character in the expression, count is increased by 1, balance is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line increments the value of `count` by 1. The second line resets the value of `balance` to 0. The initial state of `expression`, `length`, and `char` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `count` is increased by 1, and the value of `balance` is reset to 0, regardless of its previous value.
