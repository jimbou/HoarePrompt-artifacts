Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then splits the string into parts at each '-' character and calculates the total length of the parts.

The program then calls the function `func_1` with the original string and the total length of the parts as arguments. This function iterates over the characters in the string, maintaining a balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments a count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the balance is positive.

The program then prints the result of the `func_1` function for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum possible penalty, but it does not actually do that. The penalty is supposed to be the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length, but the function does not calculate this correctly.

The function `func_1` seems to be trying to count the number of times the balance becomes negative, but this is not the correct way to calculate the penalty. The correct way would be to calculate the sum of the subarray and multiply it by its length, and then take the absolute value of the result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
