Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 3 characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, char is the last character in the expression. If the last character of expression is '+', balance is increased by 1. If the last character of expression is '-', balance is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made to balance. If balance is less than 0, count is increased by 1 and balance is set to 0. Otherwise, no change is made to count and balance.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the expression will have at least 3 characters, and the length will be equal to the length of the expression. The char variable will be the last character in the expression. The balance will be increased by 1 if the last character is '+', decreased by 1 if the last character is '-', or remain unchanged if the last character is neither '+' nor '-'. If the balance is less than 0, the count will be increased by 1 and the balance will be set to 0. Otherwise, the count and balance will remain unchanged.
