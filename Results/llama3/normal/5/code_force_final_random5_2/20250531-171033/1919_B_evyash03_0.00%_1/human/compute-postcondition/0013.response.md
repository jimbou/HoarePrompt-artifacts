Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 2 characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `char` is the second character in the `expression`, `count` is 1 (if the current value of `char` is '-', otherwise it remains unchanged), `balance` is 1 (if the current value of `char` is '-', otherwise it is 1)**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `char` is '-', then `balance` is now 1. If the current value of `char` is not '-', then `balance` is also 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
