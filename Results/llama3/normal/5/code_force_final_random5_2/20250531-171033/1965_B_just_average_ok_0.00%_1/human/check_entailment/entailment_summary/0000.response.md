Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases and the two integers `n` and `k` for each test case.
2.  It generates a list of 24 integers, where the first 21 elements are powers of 2, and the last three elements are `k - 2^4`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^4 + 1`. This list is designed to satisfy the conditions of the problem.
3.  The program then prints the length of the list (24) and the elements of the list.
4.  The program repeats this process for each test case.

The key insight here is that the list of numbers generated by the program is designed to satisfy the conditions of the problem. The first 21 elements are powers of 2, which ensures that there is no subsequence with a sum of `k`. The last three elements are `k - 2^4`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^4 + 1`, which ensures that there is a subsequence with a sum of `v` for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem, and the execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior.

Correctness: **True**
