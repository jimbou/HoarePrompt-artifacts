The variables in the loop head are k and idx, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables k and idx. If k is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by idx, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, idx is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, k must be greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by 1 (which is 2), so k must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
