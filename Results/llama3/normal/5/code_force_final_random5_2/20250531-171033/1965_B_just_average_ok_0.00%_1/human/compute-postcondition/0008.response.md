Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 25, `stdin` is empty**

The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx`. Since `idx` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute until `k` is less than `1 << 25`. At this point, `idx` will be 25. The values of `n`, `nums`, and `stdin` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not affected by the loop head or body.
