Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 1, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `nums` still contains 24 integers, each of which is a power of 2. The input stream `stdin` is still empty.
