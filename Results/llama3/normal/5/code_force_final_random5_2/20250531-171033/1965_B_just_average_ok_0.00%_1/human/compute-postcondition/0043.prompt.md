Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then for each test case, two integers (n and k) separated by a space. n and k are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
    idx = 0
    while k >= 1 << idx:
        idx += 1
    idx -= 1
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[24], k + 1, and k + nums[24] + 1, idx is 24, stdin is empty, and the length of the list nums which is 24 is being printed, and the list nums is being printed which contains 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[24], k + 1, and k + nums[24] + 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is less than or equal to 4, stdin is empty, and the length of the list nums which is 24 is being printed, and the list nums which is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[4], k + 1, and k + nums[4] + 1, idx is 4, stdin is empty, the length of the list nums which is 24 is being printed, and the elements of the list nums which are 21 powers of 2 and the last three elements which are k - nums[4], k + 1, and k + nums[4] + 1 are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
