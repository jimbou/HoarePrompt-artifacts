According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `idx`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 1`, which is 2. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
