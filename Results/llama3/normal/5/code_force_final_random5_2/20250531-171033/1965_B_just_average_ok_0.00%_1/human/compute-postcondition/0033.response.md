The variables in the loop head are k and idx, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and idx. If k is greater than or equal to 1 shifted left by idx, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, idx is 1. idx being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to idx is 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
