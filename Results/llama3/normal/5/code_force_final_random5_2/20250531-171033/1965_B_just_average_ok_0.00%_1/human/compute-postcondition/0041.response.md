Based on the precondition, the list `nums` contains 24 integers, where the first 21 elements are powers of 2, and the last three elements are `k - nums[4]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[4] + 1`. The `print(*nums)` statement will print all the elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.

Since the exact values of `k` and `nums[4]` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the last three elements. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **21 powers of 2 (the first 21 elements of the list nums), k - nums[4] (the 22nd element of the list nums), k + 1 (the 23rd element of the list nums), and k + nums[4] + 1 (the 24th element of the list nums)**
