Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[24], k + 1, and k + nums[24] + 1, idx is 24, stdin is empty**

Explanation:
The code modifies the list `nums` and the variable `idx`. The first line decrements `idx` by 1, making it 24. The second line appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`, where `idx` is now 24. The third line appends `k + 1` to `nums`. The fourth line appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`. The fifth line removes the element `1 << idx` from `nums`, which is equivalent to removing the element at index `idx` (now 24) from `nums`.

The final state of `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, except for the last three elements which are `k - nums[24]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[24] + 1`. The value of `idx` is now 24. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The `stdin` remains empty.
