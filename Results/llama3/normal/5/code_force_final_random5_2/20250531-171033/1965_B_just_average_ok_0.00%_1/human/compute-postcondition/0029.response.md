The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is greater than 0 the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is less than or equal to 4, stdin is empty, and the length of the list nums which is 24 is being printed, and the list nums which is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 is being printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input must be greater than 1 and stdin is not empty.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is less than or equal to 4, stdin is not empty, and the length of the list nums which is 24 is being printed, and the list nums which is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 is being printed**
