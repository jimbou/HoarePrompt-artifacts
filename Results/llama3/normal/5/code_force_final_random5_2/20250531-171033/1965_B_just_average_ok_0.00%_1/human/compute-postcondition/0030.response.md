Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is 0, stdin is empty**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to integers greater than or equal to 1, as they were assigned values from the input. The list `nums` has been reinitialized to a list of 24 integers, each being a power of 2, as generated by the list comprehension. The variable `idx` has been reset to 0. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed by the `map` function.
