The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `idx`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `idx` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 2` (i.e., `k` must be greater than or equal to 4). No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 1, stdin is empty**
