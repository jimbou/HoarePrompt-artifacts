Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 5, `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `nums` remain unchanged, `k` is still an integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` has been incremented to 5, and `stdin` is still empty.
