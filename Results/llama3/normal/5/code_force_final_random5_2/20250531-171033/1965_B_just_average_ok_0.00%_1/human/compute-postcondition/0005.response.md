Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 2, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `idx` being equal to 2. The values of the other variables, `n`, `k`, and `nums`, remain unchanged. The `stdin` is still empty, as it was in the initial state.
