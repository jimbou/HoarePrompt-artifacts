Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2 except for the last three elements which are k - nums[4], k + 1, and k + nums[4] + 1, idx is 4, stdin is empty**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

After executing the code, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` also remains the same. The list `nums` initially contained 24 integers, each being a power of 2. The code modifies this list by appending three new elements: `k - nums[4]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[4] + 1`. Additionally, the element `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `1 << 4` or 16) is removed from the list. The value of `idx` is decremented by 1, making it 4. The state of `stdin` remains empty as it was initially.
