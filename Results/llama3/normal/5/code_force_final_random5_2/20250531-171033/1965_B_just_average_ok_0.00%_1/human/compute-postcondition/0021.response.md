The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `idx` is less than 3. So, the new value of `idx` is less than 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is less than 4, stdin is empty**
