Based on the precondition, the `nums` list contains 24 integers, where the first 21 elements are powers of 2, and the last three elements are `k - nums[24]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[24] + 1`.

The `print(*nums)` statement will print all the elements of the `nums` list, separated by spaces.

Since the first 21 elements are powers of 2, they will be printed as a sequence of powers of 2, e.g., `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...`.

The last three elements are expressions involving `k` and `nums[24]`. Since `nums[24]` is not defined, we can't compute the exact values of these expressions. However, we can describe them as follows:

* `k - nums[24]`: This will print the value of `k` minus the value of the 24th element of the `nums` list (which is not defined).
* `k + 1`: This will print the value of `k` plus 1.
* `k + nums[24] + 1`: This will print the value of `k` plus the value of the 24th element of the `nums` list (which is not defined) plus 1.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of powers of 2, followed by three expressions involving `k` and `nums[24]`.

Output: **1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., k - nums[24], k + 1, k + nums[24] + 1 (where k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and nums[24] is not defined)**
