Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 2, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin is still empty.
