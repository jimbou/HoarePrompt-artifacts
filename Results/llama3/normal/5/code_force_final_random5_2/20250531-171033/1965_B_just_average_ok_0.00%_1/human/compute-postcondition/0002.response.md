To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of `k` and `idx` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the loop condition `k >= 1 << idx`, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to the value of `1` shifted left by `idx` places. Since `idx` is 0, `1 << idx` equals 1. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
