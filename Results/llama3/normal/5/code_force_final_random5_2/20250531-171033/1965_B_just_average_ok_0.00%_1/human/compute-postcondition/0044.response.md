Functionality: This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts two inputs: the number of test cases and, for each test case, two integers (n and k) separated by a space. The function generates a list of 24 integers, where the first 21 are powers of 2, and the last three are k - nums[4], k + 1, and k + nums[4] + 1. It then prints the length of the list (24) and the elements of the list. The function repeats this process for each test case.
