Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is 0, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the input values from stdin, which are integers greater than 0 and greater than or equal to 1, respectively. The list `nums` has been reinitialized to contain 24 integers, each of which is a power of 2, calculated using the expression `(1 << i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 23. The variable `idx` has been reset to 0. The stdin is now empty since the input values have been consumed.
