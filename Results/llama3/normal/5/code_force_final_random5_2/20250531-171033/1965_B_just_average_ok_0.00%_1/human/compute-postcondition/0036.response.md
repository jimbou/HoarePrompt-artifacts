The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The value of `idx` was 1, so the value of `idx` is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin is still empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 2, `stdin` is empty.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is 2, `stdin` is empty**
