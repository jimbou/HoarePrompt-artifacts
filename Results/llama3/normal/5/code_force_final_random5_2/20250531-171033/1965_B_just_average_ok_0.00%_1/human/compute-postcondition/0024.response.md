Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, nums is a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, idx is less than or equal to 4, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains an integer greater than 0, `k` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` remains a list of 24 integers where each integer is a power of 2, `idx` is less than or equal to 4, and stdin remains empty.
