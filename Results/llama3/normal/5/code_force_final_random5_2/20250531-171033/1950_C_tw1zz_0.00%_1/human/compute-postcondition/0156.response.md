The code snippet assigns the string '04' to `h1` and the string 'AM' to `time`. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial values of `h`, `m1`, `stdin`, `t`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, time is 'AM', h1 is '04', stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes.**
