Output: **h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is a string, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 0. If h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is '02', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '02'. If h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 is an empty string. If h is between '13' and '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. Otherwise, h, m1, time remain unchanged. The time in 12-hour format is being printed, which is represented by h1, followed by a colon, followed by the minutes m1, followed by the time of day time.**
