Postcondition: **h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is a string, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 0. If h is '23', then h1 is '11', time is 'PM'. If h is not '23', then if h is '00', time is 'PM', h1 is '12', otherwise h, m1, time remain unchanged.**
