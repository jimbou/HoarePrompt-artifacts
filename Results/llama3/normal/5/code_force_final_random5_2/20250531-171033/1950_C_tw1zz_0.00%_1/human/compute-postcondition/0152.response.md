The code snippet provided assigns the input string in the format hh:mm to the variables h and m, then assigns an empty string to h1 and the value of m to m1, and finally assigns an empty string to time.

The initial state is: h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is a string, stdin contains t lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes.

After executing the code, the final state is:

Output State: **h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, time is an empty string, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes.**

In this final state, the values of h and time have been modified to empty strings, and the value of m1 has been updated to be equal to m. The other variables remain unchanged.
