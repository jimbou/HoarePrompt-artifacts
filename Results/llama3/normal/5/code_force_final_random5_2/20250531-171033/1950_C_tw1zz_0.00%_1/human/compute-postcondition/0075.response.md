Postcondition: ***h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is a string, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 0. If h is '22', then time is 'PM', h1 is '10'. If h is '23', then time is 'PM', h1 is '11'. If h is '00', then time is 'PM', h1 is '12'. Otherwise, h, m1, time remain unchanged.***
