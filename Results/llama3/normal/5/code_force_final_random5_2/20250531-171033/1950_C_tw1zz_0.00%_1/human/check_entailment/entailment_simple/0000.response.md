Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to convert a given time in 24-hour format to its equivalent time in 12-hour format. The program takes the hour and minute as input, determines whether the time is AM or PM based on the hour, and then prints the time in 12-hour format.

However, there is a logical error in the program. When the hour is '00', the program sets the time to 'PM', which is incorrect. '00' in 24-hour format corresponds to '12' in 12-hour format, and it should be 'AM', not 'PM'.

Correctness: **False**
