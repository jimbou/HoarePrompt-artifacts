Postcondition: ***h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, and m is a string of two digits representing minutes. If h is '20', then h1 is '08' and time is 'PM'. If h is '21', '22', '23', or '00', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively. If h is not '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then time and h1 remain unchanged.***
