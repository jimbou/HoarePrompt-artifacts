Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a valid input: the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1440), and the following t lines each contain a string s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
    h1, m1 = '', m
    time = ''
    if h == '01':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '02':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '03':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '04':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '05':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '06':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '07':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '08':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '09':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '10':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '11':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '12':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '13':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '14':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '15':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '16':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '17':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '18':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '19':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '20':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '21':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '22':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '23':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '00':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'PM'
    print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is a string, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 0. If h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is '02', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '02'. If h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 is an empty string. If h is between '13' and '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. Otherwise, h, m1, time remain unchanged. The time in 12-hour format is being printed, which is represented by h1, followed by a colon, followed by the minutes m1, followed by the time of day time.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is a string, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes. If h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is '02', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '02'. If h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, and this is printed: h1 (where h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' depending on the value of h), a colon (:), m (where m is a string of two digits representing minutes), a space, and time (where time is 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the value of h)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, and m is a string of two digits representing minutes. If h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, and the time in the format h1:m:time is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
