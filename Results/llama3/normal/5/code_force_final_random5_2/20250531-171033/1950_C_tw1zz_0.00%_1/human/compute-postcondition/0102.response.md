Output State: **h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is 'AM', t is a positive integer greater than 1, h1 is '02', m is a string of two digits representing minutes, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm**

The code assigns the string '02' to `h1` and the string 'AM' to `time`. No other variables are affected. The values of `h`, `m1`, `t`, `m`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
