The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `h1` and `time`. The first line assigns the string `'11'` to `h1`, and the second line assigns the string `'AM'` to `time`. These assignments do not affect the values of any other variables.

Output State: **h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, time is 'AM', h1 is '11', m is a string of two digits representing minutes, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1**
