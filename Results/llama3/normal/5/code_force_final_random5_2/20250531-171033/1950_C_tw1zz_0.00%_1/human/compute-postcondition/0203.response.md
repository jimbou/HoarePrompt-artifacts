Output State: **h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, stdin is empty, t is 0, and m is a string of two digits representing minutes. If the initial value of h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If the initial value of h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively. If the initial value of h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively, and the time in the format h1:m:time has been printed for all input times.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable h will be an empty string, the variable m1 will be equal to the variable m (which represents the minutes), the standard input (stdin) will be empty because all input times have been processed, the variable t will be 0 because all iterations have been completed, and the variable m will still represent the minutes. The time of day (time) and the hour in 12-hour format (h1) will depend on the initial value of h, and the time in the format h1:m:time will have been printed for all input times.
