Postcondition: ***h is an empty string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes equal to m, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes. If h is '22', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '10'. If h is not '22', then if h is '23', time is 'PM' and h1 is '11'. If h is '00', time is 'PM' and h1 is '12', otherwise time and h1 remain unchanged.***
