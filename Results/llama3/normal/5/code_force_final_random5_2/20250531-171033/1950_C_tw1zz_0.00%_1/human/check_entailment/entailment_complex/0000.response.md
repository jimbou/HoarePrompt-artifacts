Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format. It takes a string input in the format "hh:mm" and outputs the equivalent time in 12-hour format.

The program uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format based on the input hour. For hours 01-11, it sets the time to 'AM' and keeps the hour the same. For hours 13-23, it sets the time to 'PM' and subtracts 12 from the hour. For hour 00, it sets the time to 'AM' and sets the hour to 12.

The program then prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM".

However, there is a logical error in the program. When the input hour is 00, the program sets the time to 'PM', but it should set it to 'AM'. This is because 00:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format, not 12:00 PM.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
