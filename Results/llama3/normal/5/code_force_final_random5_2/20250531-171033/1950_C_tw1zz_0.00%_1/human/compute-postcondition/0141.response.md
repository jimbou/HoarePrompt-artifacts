Postcondition: ***h is a string, m1 is a string of two digits representing minutes, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings in the format hh:mm, t is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a string of two digits representing minutes. If h is '08', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '08'. If h is '09', '10', '11', or '12', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12' respectively. If h is not '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', then the state of time and h1 is not changed.***
