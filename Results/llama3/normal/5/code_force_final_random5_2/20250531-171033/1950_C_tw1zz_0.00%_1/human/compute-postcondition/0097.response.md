Output: **the hour in 12-hour format (h1), a colon (:), the minutes (m1), a space, and the time of day (time)**.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `h1` is the hour in 12-hour format, which is determined by the value of `h`. If `h` is between '01' and '11', `h1` is the same as `h`. If `h` is '12', `h1` is an empty string. If `h` is between '13' and '23', `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.). If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12'.
* `m1` is the minutes, which is a string of two digits.
* `time` is the time of day, which is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is between '01' and '11', `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is between '13' and '23', `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `time` is 'AM'.
* The `sep=''` argument in the `print` function means that the output will be printed without any separators between the values.

Therefore, the output will be the hour in 12-hour format (`h1`), followed by a colon (:), the minutes (`m1`), a space, and the time of day (`time`).
